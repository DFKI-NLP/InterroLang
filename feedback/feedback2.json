The question here is whether the sender wants the information to get registered. Based on their response 'yes', the question is answered and the dialogue ends. Overinform dialogue Acts are similar to questions, but they are more general and are often used when the other options are not applicable. For example, if I ask you how your day was, you might respond with a detailed account of your activities. This is an overinform act, because there are many other ways to respond to this question. However, it would be more appropriate to use a commissIVE dialogue action, such as 'tell me about your days', which would provide a more succinct account. Direct dialogue Act is used by the speaker to communicate a request or order to the listener. In this case, 'do you have any questions for me?'. If the receiver does have a follow up question after the initial request, then the order is followed and a direct dialogue is concluded. Otherwise, a non-directive dialogue would conclude the conversation. In this example the request is for the questions to follow, so a command is the most appropriate dialogue label.",
