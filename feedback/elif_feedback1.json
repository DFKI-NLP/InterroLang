        "answer": "Original text: Text: 'come on man! i even got dope and acid! try some!'\nPrediction: directive\nExplanation: directive is a directive dialogueact, where the speaker is trying to get the listener to do something. In this case, it's the subject of the sentence, \"try some!\". The directive act can also be used as a general purpose act, to express a request or order. overinform: the information provided is not particularly useful or helpful. This is because the provided information is either not true, does not apply to the situation, is too general, etc. Overinform is used when the actual information that is needed is provided later in the conversation. For example, if I ask you where a car is, and you tell me that the car you are looking for is in a nearby parking lot, I would consider this overinform, because I already know where your car resides. I need to know more about the specifics of your situation to provide the needed information. question: this act describes a conversation where two people are communicating with each other. One person is asking a direct question to another person. They are not necessarily trying get a response from the other person, but they are just trying make sense of something, find an answer, understand something better. So, in this example the question act. The question is \"where is the parking?\". And the answer is given by the person who is looking in their car for the parked car. \"In a nearby parking.\". Here the direct answer was given, so the act was classified out of question. However, this is an example of a dialogue where there is no promise or command given. If the same conversation was about a pizza place, then the command act might be more appropriate. But in general the promise act and command acts are used in conjunction with questions. inform (question): this acts describes the first person asking the second person a specific question or making a statement. Then the inform act takes place. After the ask or statement, there might or might not be a follow up question from second. Sometimes the followup question might even be from third person or someone else. Like in example 1, after the \"Where is it?\" the inquirer might get another answer \"in a parking\". Inform is also used to describe a situation where someone is giving information to someone. Example 2. A person might say \"I am going to a party tomorrow and I will bring some alcohol. Please don't tell anyone\". This act could also describe the action of someone giving a gift to other, like a present.",
