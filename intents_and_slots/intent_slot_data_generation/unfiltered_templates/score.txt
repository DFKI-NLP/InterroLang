testing {metric}
give me the {metric} on the data
give me the {metric} on the {data_type} data
testing {metric} please
nice! could you give me the test {metric} on the {data_type} data?
training {metric} please
how often are you right?
how often are you correct?
what's the rate you do correct predictions?
how frequently do you get it correct?
how accurate is the model on all the data?
how accurate is the model over all the instances in the data?
how accurate are you in predicting the class {class_names}?
when scoring {class_names}, what's the model's {metric}?
nice! could you give me the test {metric}?
display {metric}
show me the {data_type} set performance
testing {metric}
I meant what is the {metric} score on the {data_type} data
what is the {metric} score on the {data_type} data
can you show me the {metric} on the data?
can you show me the {metric} on the {data_type} data?
give the {metric} score
testing {metric} score
when determining {class_names}, what is your {metric} score?
can you show me the {metric} score on the {data_type} data?
what's the {metric} score
what's the {metric} for instances containing {includetoken}?
what's the testing {metric} for examples including {includetoken}
what's the {metric} performance of the model on the {data_type} data for texts with {includetoken}
for {includetoken}, how well, in terms of {metric}, does the model do on the {data_type} data
what's the {metric} on {includetoken}?
what's the {metric} on {includetoken}?
could you tell me the {metric} on the {data_type} data for {includetoken}
what's the {metric} on {includetoken}?
what's the {metric} on this data?
