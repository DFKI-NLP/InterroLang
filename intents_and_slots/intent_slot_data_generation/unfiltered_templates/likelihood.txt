I want you to tell me the probability of the instance with id {id} being predicted in the "{class_names}" class by the model
return the probability that instance {id} is predicted in the {class_names} class
what's the chance instance id {id} is scored as {class_names}
probability that id {id} is predicted as "{class_names}" from the model
show me the prediction probabilities for instances with {includetoken}
what are the class probabilities on your predictions for texts including {includetoken}?
likelihood for {class_names} to be predicted?
