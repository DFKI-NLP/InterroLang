Argument with * means that it is optional.

#followup operation: just use the dialogue history for this!

NB: id can be a list, also several labels are possible [several intents]

Use parallel adapters for intents + slot tagger for each type (tagger for [id, class_names, number, includetoken, metric, data_type]). Note that class_names, metric and data_type are closed (limited number of values) others are open.

TODO: store previous operation [intent+slots] in the conversation object, ask clarification question if some values for core arguments are missing
