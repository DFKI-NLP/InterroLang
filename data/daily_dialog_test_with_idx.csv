I suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . That ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow . ",4
352," Oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . She is always flushing things down the toilet . You know how kids are . ",1
353," Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it ’ s urgent . ",1
354, That would be great ! Is it expensive ? ,2
355, Let ’ s see ... I would say about eight hundred dollars . ,1
356,"Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet . ",3
357, I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ? ,2
358, My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . ,1
359, I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? ,2
360," Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . ",1
361, You need a babysitter . ,3
362," Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . ",4
363, I could have Suzy stay at my place . ,1
364," I don't want to do that to you , Karen . ",1
365, Why not ? ,2
366, Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . ,1
367," I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . ",1
368," I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . ",1
369, I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . ,1
370, I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older . ,1
371, I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . ,1
372, Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free . ,3
373,Good evening . What'll you have ? ,2
374, I'd like a beer . What kind of beer do you have ? ,2
375, Draft beer and cans beer . Which do you prefer ? ,2
376, A draft beer please . ,1
377, OK . Here you are . ,1
378, Could I have some fruit ? ,3
379," Of course . Wait for a moment , please . ",4
380,"Hello , Mr . Black , how are you ? ",2
381," Fine , thank you , and how are you ? ",2
382," Very well , thank you . It's nice to meet you again . I am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport , as I was busy yesterday . I do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from New York . ",1
383," Yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . Thank you . ",1
384, How are you getting along with your business ? ,2
385," Not bad . The fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . I hope there will be more buyers in the market this year . ",1
386," I hope we can do more business together . Though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . In the meantime , let's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance . ",3
387,"By the way miss , where is the toilet ? ",2
388," Toilets are in the rear , I am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment . ",1
389," What ? Oh , what we live ! Thank you very much for your help , miss . ",2
390, You are welcome . ,1
391,"excuse me , could you tell me which line I ’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ? ",3
392," you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage . ",4
393, that ’ s a really long line . How long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ? ,2
394," it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait . ",1
395, can I buy stamps here ? ,3
396, sure . How many would you like ? ,2
397, I need 30 for my Christmas cards . ,1
398, are you sending them abroad ? ,2
399, twenty of them are going abroad to China and America . ,1
400," do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive . ",2
401, no . ,1
402," ok , here you go . That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence . ",1
403, and the bubble wrap ? ,2
404, that ’ s another quid . ,1
405, thanks a lot . You ’ Ve been very helpful . ,1
406,"Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ? ",2
407, I am cooking now ! ,1
408, Are you good at cooking ? ,2
409," I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking ! ",1
410, It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? ! ,2
411, I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ? ,2
412," Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty . ",1
413, That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much . ,1
414, I have the same idea as yours . ,1
415, It's OK . Please have a taste of it . ,3
416," Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious . ",4
417, Thank you for your praise . ,1
418," Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ? ",2
419," I am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc . ",1
420," So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ? ",3
421, Why not ? It is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking . ,4
422, Thanks a lot . ,1
423, It's my pleasure . ,1
424,Room service.What can I do for you ? ,2
425, This is room 2012 . Where is my laundry ? You promised to send to me this morning . ,2
426," Well , let me check for you . I am sorry , sir . They mistook your order as a normal one.Actualty it's an express laundry , is that right ? ",2
427," Yes , I ordered the express service . ",1
428," Sir , we are terribly sorry for that.We will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room 3 hours later . Is that all right ? ",3
429, That's fine . ,4
430,I'd like you to do me a favor . ,3
431, What is it ? ,2
432, Can you mail this at the post office for me ? I have to go to the doctor for an appointment and I don't have enough time to go to the post office . ,3
433, Sure . And I'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's . ,4
434,"Excuse me , may I help you ? ",2
435, Would you please fill some gas for me ? ,3
436, Sure . Which kind of gas do you want ? ,2
437," Unleaded , please . ",1
438, OK . ,4
439,I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports . ,3
440, It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight . ,1
441, What about a draft at 120 days sight ? ,3
442, All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us . ,3
443, A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due . ,4
444, Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible . ,3
445, I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries . ,4
446, So do I . ,1
447,"There's a new girl in school , have you seen her yet ? ",2
448, I haven't seen her yet . ,1
449, I think that she is very pretty . ,1
450, Tell me how she looks . ,1
451, She's kind of short . ,1
452, What height is she ? ,2
453, She's probably about five feet . ,1
454," That's nice , but tell me what she looks like . ",2
455, The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes . ,1
456, I think I might've bumped into her before . ,1
457, Are you telling me that you've seen her before ? ,2
458, I believe so . ,1
459,"Take a seat inside and see what you think.So you will take the Porsche then , sir ? ",2
460," Yes , and I want to buy the insurance too . I think it's necessary . ",1
461," You're smart to buy it . At 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal . ",1
462, Can I return the car in San Francisco ? ,3
463," San Francisco ? No , sir.We only have this office here . You will have to return it here . ",4
464, Really ? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities . ,2
465," No , sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot . ",1
466," Well , I guess I will have to drive back down then . Hmm . I didn't think of that . ",1
467," Do you still want the car , sir ? ",2
468, Yes . It will be fun . Driving back down the coast . My girlfriend will like it . ,1
469, It's a beautiful drive . ,1
470, Where are the keys ? ,2
471," Just a moment , sir . We have to finish filling out the forms . ",1
472,Gary . Could you type up this report for me ? I have to take off early this afternoon . ,3
473, Sure . Just leave it to me . I'll finish it . ,4
474,Look at the show on TV . I am watching a food show at a very famous seafood restaurant . I really want to eat at that restaurant . I am a seafood lover . ,1
475," Speaking of seafood , my mouth is watering . Let's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood . ",3
476, Sound great . Let's go ! ,4
477, Look at the crystal clear fridge . You can see so many kinds of seafood in it . They all look very fresh and delicious . ,3
478, True . I would like to have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head . ,4
479, You sound like a seafood expert . I would like to have some stir-fried squids and steamed shrimps . ,1
480, You are not too bad as well . I also want to have a steamed lobster . It is really taste like heaven . ,1
481, Let's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food . ,3
482, Wait . Let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first . ,4
483, OK . I will wait for you inside the restaurant ,1
484, Do you think we should try some deep fried oysters ? ,2
485,Where do you want to go ? ,2
486, I'm going to the hospital . ,1
487, Get in . I'll take you . ,3
488, About how much will it cost ? ,2
489, It will cost you $ 10 . ,1
490," By the way , what's the time ? ",2
491," You can see the time on the meter . I have radio time , you know . ",1
492, It's a quarter to 12 . Could you please drive a little faster ? ,3
493, Certainly . ,4
494,You're made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual . ,1
495, Where was it from ? ,2
496, It was made in Jingdezhen . ,1
497, Jingdezhen ? Isn't it called ' the capital of porcelain ' ? ,2
498, You are right . ,1
499, This is the very thing I've been dreaming of . ,1
500, It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China . ,1
501, It must be most precious . ,1
502, But it is really worth the price . ,1
503,"Hello , Miao Li , Where are you going ? ",2
504," Hello , I am going to the store to buy some fruit . ",1
505," Oh , Would you do me a favor ? ",3
506, Yes ? ,2
507, Please mail this letter for me on your way to the store . ,3
508, Sure . Do you want it to be registered ? ,2
509," Yes , I think so . There are some pictures in it . It would be a great pity if they were lost . ",1
510," Yes , I will be glad to mail your letter . ",1
511, Thanks . ,1
512, you are welcome . ,1
513,"I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ? ",2
514, Alright . ,1
515, It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . ,3
516," Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital . ",3
517, Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . ,4
518," Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time . ",3
519, It really hurts . ,4
520," Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ? ",2
521, To hell with you . The accident was your fault . ,1
522," I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ? ",2
523, To hell with you . ,1
524,"Good morning . Vane Theater , at your service . ",1
525, Hello . I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . What's on this weekend ? ,2
526," Well , there will be charity performance on Saturday night . And also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night . ",1
527, It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ? ,3
528, Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless . ,4
529, What about the performance itself ? ,2
530," Oh , it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven . ",1
531," Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite . ",1
532, It surely is . And the cast is really the best . ,1
533, Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ? ,2
534," The price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back . ",1
535,All right . I want to bring everybody back on this subject . When can we start working on this ? ,2
536," Well , we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00 . ",3
537," I tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and I'll come by at around 3:00 ",4
538, That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ? ,2
539," Perhaps one year , I'm not sure . ",1
540,What dressing would you like on the salad ? ,2
541," French dressing , please . ",1
542, I beg your pardon ? ,2
543," Oh , French dressing . ",1
544," Sorry , it's not available now.Anything else ? ",2
545, We still prefer French dressing . ,1
546,Could I have some fish ? ,3
547, Certainly . And what vegetables would you like ? ,2
548," Oh , spinach , I think . ",1
549," Fine , And what about something to drink ? ",3
550," Just a beer , please . ",4
551, Good . Thank you.sir . ,1
552, Would you like to have some more beer ? ,3
553," No , thanks . I ' Ve had enough . I'll have my bill , please . ",4
554, Of course . Please wait a moment . I'll go and get it . ,3
555, Thank you . ,4
556,"Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ? ",3
557," Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . ",3
558," Yeah , that's very important . ",4
559," So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . ",3
560, I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . ,4
561," That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . ",3
562, It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . ,4
563," It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . ",3
564, But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . ,4
565," I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . ",3
566, It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . ,4
567," You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . ",3
568, I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . ,4
569, You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . ,3
570, It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . ,4
571," It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . ",3
572,"The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? ",2
573, No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . ,1
574, It better be more than last year . ,1
575," Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . ",1
576,"I'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed . ",3
577, What a pity ! ,1
578," If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ? ",3
579, That's OK . ,4
580,"Good day ! Welcome to Lincoln Bank , how may we assist you ? ",2
581, Hello . I need to find out if a Receipt of Proceeds has arrived . I'm from Felix Wasserman Associates . ,3
582, Thanks . Have you got the L / C number ? ,2
583, It's NX567822100007 . ,1
584, Hang on a tick and I'll check for you . I'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving . ,4
585," OK , thanks for checking . Could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ? ",3
586, No problem . I'll be in touch as soon as it comes in . ,4
587,May I help you ? ,2
588," Yes . I have to stay in your cry for just one day , can you suggest a short tour ? ",2
589, Are you interested in the natural landscape or the human landscape ? ,2
590, I would prefer the first one . ,1
591, Sure . We have a one-day trip along the river . It's quite beautiful . ,3
592,"Hello , Sir . How can we help you today ? ",2
593," I need to find out some more information for L / C . I would like an outline of responsibilities , both ours , yours and the beneficiary , please . ",3
594," OK , to start , the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include Insurance Forms , Way Bills , Bills of Lading , Customs forms , various certificates . ",1
595," OK , got it . Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead ? ",2
596," Just that in effect , a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds . ",1
597," That sounds fine , thanks for that . Let's go ahead ! ",3
598,911 emergency . What is the problem ? ,2
599, I would like to report a break-in . ,3
600, When was this break-in ? ,2
601, I believe it happened last night . ,1
602, Where was the break-in ? ,2
603, It happened at my house . ,1
604, Was anything stolen ? ,2
605, I haven't checked yet . ,1
606, Why do you think there was a break-in ? ,2
607, My front window was broken . ,1
608, We'll send a squad car shortly . ,3
609, I'd appreciate that . ,4
610,Excuse me . How much is the chocolate bar ? ,2
611, One dollar . ,1
612," So , I can have five for five dollars ? ",2
613," Actually , you can only have four . ",1
614," Oh , yeah . I forgot tax . Give me four then , please . ",3
615, Okay . Thanks . ,4
616,House keeping.May I come in ? ,3
617, Come in please . ,4
618," Good evening , sir . I come to make the bed . Shall I do it now or later ? ",2
619," Well , since you have come , do it now please ? ",3
620, That's all . Have a nice stay here . ,4
621, Thank you.Please get some soap for us . ,3
622, Just a moment . I will do it right now . ,4
623,"Ms . Montgomery ? This is Richard Thomas . I ’ m sorry to bother you at home , but I ’ Ve got a bit of a problem . ",1

626,Excuse me . I have an appointment with Mr . Li at nine . May I come in ? ,3
627," Yes , come in please . I am Mr . Li . You must be My Liu , right ? ",2
628," Yes , I am My Liu . Thanks . ",1
629, I'd like to start this interview with some questions . Why do you think you are qualified for this position ? ,2
630," According to your advertisement , you want an experienced software engineer . I think my background meets the requirement of this position . ",1
631, Then tell me something about your background . ,3
632," My major was computer science when I was at college , and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language . ",1
633," Well , what do you think about the development in computers ? ",2
634," The developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . In some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . So I think the software industry has a great future . ",1
635, Have you ever designed any programs concerning network ? ,2
636," Yes , I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE . ",1

648, She kept bothering me . ,1
649, She ’ s your sister . What she asked was only duck soup for you . Why can ’ t you be good to her ? ,2
650," But I am her brother , not her servant . ",1
651,"Hello , where can I buy an inexpensive cashmere sweater ? ",2
652, Maybe you should look around for an outlet . ,3
653, That is a wonderful idea . ,4
654, Outlets have more reasonable prices . ,1
655, Thank you for your help . ,1
656, No problem . Good luck ,1
657,Wow ! Your fruit looks really fresh ! How much are these apples ? ,2
658, The apples are 30NT each . How many would you like ? ,2
659," Let's see , 30NT is about ... almost a dollar US . What ? ! How about these pineapples ? ",2
660," They're 250NT each , but they're not edible . They're only used for worship . ",1
661," Hmm , 250NT is ... 8 dollars ? ! ! And you can't even eat them ? You're crazy ! ",2
662, Wait ! Don't go just yet . These bananas are pretty cheap--only 35NT for this bunch . ,1

671, really ? Why ? ,2
672, it's complicated . But basically it boils down to one thing . This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go . ,1
673, but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here ! ,1
674," well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer . ",1
675, well that's great news ! Congratulations ! Where will you be located ? ,2

1117, I actually like the food there . ,1
1118, Does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food ? ,2
1119, They have anything you want . ,1
1120, I was thinking about getting some Chinese food . ,3
1121, I bought some chow mein at the cafeteria . It tasted great . ,4
1122, We can eat at the cafeteria . ,3
1123, I think you'll really like the food there . ,4
1124,"Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names . ",3
1125, That's OK . ,4
1126, The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective . ,1
1127," Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared . ",1
1128, Thank you . ,1
1129," Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time . ",3
1130, That's a good idea . ,4
1131," First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract . ",3
1132, Agreed . ,4
1133," For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments . ",3

1141," How do you do , Jack . Nice to meet you . ",1
1142," Well , I think you ' Ve reconsidered our proposal , Diane . ",1
1143," Yes , you are right . After all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . The only problem is price . ",1
1144," I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable . ",2
1145," That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 . ",3
1146," That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount . ",3
1147," I see your point . That's to say s 611 each set . Still it's much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ? ",3
1148," Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ? ",3
1149, All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set . ,4
1150, Very well . Thank you . ,1
1151,Don't I know you ? ,2

1157," When we have the final results , we will call you . ",3
1158, Then when will I get a reply at the latest ? ,2
1159," If you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks . ",1
1160," But if I don't pass , will you call me ? ",2
1161," I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful . ",1
1162, Then do I have the chance to get this job ? ,2
1163," I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers . ",3
1164," I know . No matter what the result will be , I have learned a lot from our conversation . ",1

1190, What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ? ,2
1191," Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat . ",3
1192,I think Yoga might be suitable for me . ,1
1193, Why ? ,2
1194, Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up . ,1
1195, But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too . ,1

1209, And what's the cause of that ? ,2
1210, Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down . ,3
1211, But I can't just slow down . ,4
1212," You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones . That's too much for a man of your size . ",3

1220," No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park . ",1
1221, Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ? ,2
1222," It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them . ",1
1223," Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally . ",1
1224,I want some cosmetics.Could you recommend some ? ,3

1236,Can we choose a time to look at houses together ? ,3
1237," Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ? ",2
1238, Either way is good for me . ,1
1239, There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . Would that okay with you ? ,2
1240," I can take a little time off of work , or I can go on a weekend , also . ",1
1241," We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home . ",2
1242," I am leaving from work , so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at . ",1
1243, I can think of five houses that we should look at . It will take most of the day . ,1
1244, I would like to see as many as possible . ,1

1254," Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way . ",1
1255,"Mom , when you come home , please buy a coat , a skirt , a sweater ... ",3
1256, Enough is enough . I know . ,4
1257,"Mr.Chen , do you mind if I smoke ? ",3
1258," I'm sorry , Mrs . Lin . We don't allow smoking in the office . ",4
1259,"Good morning , can I help you ? ",2

1272," Tomato or orange juice , please . ",1
1273," Yes , sir . I ’ ll get them for you right away . Would you please sign this bill first ? Thank you , sir . ",3
1274,Should we tip ? This service is pretty good . ,2
1275," Yeah , we probably should.How much is normal ? ",2
1276, How about 10 percent ? That's about 6 dollars . ,3
1277, That sounds about right . ,4

1307, Let's see ... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked . But I have seats for the 17th . ,3
1308, The 17th will be fine . ,4
1309, And what date will you be returning ? ,2

1333," Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content . ",1

1351," Oh , I don ’ t know ... it ’ s hard to find the right nanny . You have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . I would love to have ",4
1352," I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great ",3
1353," Oh , that ’ s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ’ ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ’ t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go ",4

1484, Thank you . You ' Ve been very helpful . ,4
1485,"Mr . Crandall , I ’ m sorry , but I really don ’ t see the value in doing this entire project over from scratch . It would take a lot of work . ",3
1486," That ’ s certainly true . But , that ’ s what this job is all about , Maria . There's no doubt that this project is unacceptable . ",3
1487, I agree . But I think that we can handle the problem by making a few major changes . I ’ d appreciate it if you would give me a chance . ,3
1488," All right , Maria . I ’ ll give you until tomorrow at 4:00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work , but otherwise , you ’ ll have to re-do it . ",4

1521, Yes . Actually our range of sweaters is the most comprehensive available . ,1

1523," Sure , go ahead . ",4
1524," The color is too bright.For my age , I would prefer a lighter color . ",1

1609,Have you ever tried shopping online ? ,2
1610," No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes . ",1
1611, That's right . Seeing is believing . ,1
1612," I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement . ",1
1613," That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear . ",1
1614," What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password . ",1
1615," It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough . ",1
1616, I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping . ,1

1626," Yes , at the end of the hall . ",1

1643, Was anything taken ? ,2
1644, I'm not sure yet . ,1
1645, What makes you think there was a break-in ? ,2
1646, My front window was busted . ,1
1647, I'll send a squad car . ,3
1648, Please hurry . ,4
1649,"Good morning , everyone . Let me introduce myself to you ... ",1
1650," You don't need to introduce yourself , Yang . You're famous . ",1
1651," Well , thank you very much but I thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule — at least for a while . ",3
1652," OK , OK ! ",4
1653," Now , I'd like to get things under way . The main topic on today's agenda is the development of a U . S . sales strategy for the new EBB . I'd like to hear all of your ideas , Mr . Wall , you seem in top form today . Could you start the ball rolling ? ",3
1654," Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising . ",1
1655," Well , that's kind of obvious . ",1
1656," Give me a break , Mr Yang . ",3
1657," Uh , let's keep this going , shall we ? ",4
1658,"I'm sorry , but I don't think this damage is our fault . ",1

1663," No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering . ",3
1664," Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . ",1
1665," Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ? ",2
1666," Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . ",1
1667, Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production ,1
1668," That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! ",3
1669," Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... ",4
1670," Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . ",1
1671," Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? ",2
1672," I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . ",1
1673, Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ? ,2
1674," It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach . ",1
1675," Ah , get back to you . ",4
1676, Mr . Johnson ? Mr . Johnson ? ,2
1677,Do you need a guide ? ,3
1678," Yes , we are just looking for one . What's the charge per day ? ",2
1679," It's $ 20 . If you are staying for more than 3 days in the city , the charge is $ 16 per day . ",1
1680, That's reasonable . ,4
1681,Aren't you Jim Green ? ,2
1682," Yes , that's right . ",1

1759," You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag . ",1
1760," The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins . ",1

2383,"So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ... ",2
2384," No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . ",1
2385, How many people are on the board of directors ? ,2
2386," Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line . ",1
2387,"How much will my pay be , if you don ’ t mind my asking ? ",2

2390, No problem . We'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room . ,4
2391,"Mum , can I finish my homework later ? ",3

2393, But I want to watch TV now . ,3
2394, That ’ s out of the question . ,4
2395, Please . ,3
2396, Not a chance . ,4
2397, Not even for an hour ? ,3
2398," Sorry , it ’ s impossible . ",4
2399,"Where ’ s Sally , Jack ? ",2

2405, I beg your pardon ? Who ’ s climbing the tree . ,2
2406, Tim is . ,1
2407, What about the dog ? ,2
2408," The dog ’ s in the garden , too . It ’ s running across the grass . It ’ s running after a cat . ",1

2440,"Dave , there's something I want to talk to you about . ",3
2441," Zina , why are you whispering ? ",2
2442, I've been talking to WebTracker . I'm thinking of jumping ship . ,1
2443, What ? Are you serious ? You'd defect to our archrival ! ? ,2
2444, Keep your voice down . We'll talk more later . Right now I need to see Vince . ,3
2445," We definitely have to talk , Zina . And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose . ",3
2446," OK , but don't tell anyone what I said . ",3
2447,You get your bus pass ? ,2
2448, I'm not going to buy one . ,1
2449, You're not ? ,2
2450, I think it's a waste of money . ,1
2451, It actually costs less if you have a bus pass . ,1
2452, How is that ? ,2
2453, You can use it however many times you need to . ,1
2454, Is that right ? ,2
2455," Yup , and you can keep the money in your pocket . ",1

2469, That is 413-447-9662 ? ,2

2485," I don ’ t like it.It takes up too much time and I really hate having it clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away . ",1
2486, You can ask the guests for help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes . ,3
2487, So what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food . ,2
2488," Italian , Indian and chinese . I ’ Ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and I need some more practice . ",1
2489, Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ? ,2
2490," Not at all.You can find most of them in supermarkets.The ingredients are usually the same as in Western food.The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients . ",1
2491, How long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people ? ,2
2492," Obviously , it depends on what I ’ m cooking.But I ’ d say it generally takes about one and a half hours . ",1

2501, One last question ,1
2502," Oh , no . Everything we sell here is "" as is . "" ",1
2503, I guess I was asking for too much . ,1
2504," If it breaks down , maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet . ",1
2505,We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet ! ,3
2506, Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy . or a kitty ! ,4
2507, Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ? ,2
2508," I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard ! ",1
2509," What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog . ",2
2510, Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ? ,3
2511," We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house . ",4
2512, Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome ! ,3

2523, You can't be serious ! ,1
2524," Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you . ",1
2525," After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together . ",3
2526, Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case . ,4
2527," You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all ! ",3
2528, Whatever you say ! ,4
2529,Have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax ? ,2
2530, Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ? ,1
2531, I don't really know . Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . He can even help you avoid paying tax legally . ,3
2532," If I don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ? ",2
2533," Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection.They ' ll check your income through computers . You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined . ",1
2534,What's up ? You sound a little down in dumps . ,2
2535, I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn . ,1
2536, Calm down ! Shouting won ’ t help ? ,2
2537, He is really outrageous . ,1
2538, What happened ? ,2
2539," I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me . ",1
2540, What ? He can't do this to you . ,1
2541," Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know . ",1
2542, What did you do ? ,2
2543, I shouted it back of course . ,1
2544," Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ? ",3
2545, What would you do if you were in my shoes ? ,2
2546," Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him . ",1
2547," No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault . ",4
2548," I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate . ",1
2549, I am too angry to do that . ,1
2550,"Excuse me . I am looking for a book called Little Women , but I can't find it anywhere . ",3
2551, Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out . ,4

2554, That's terrific . Thank you . ,4
2555,Who do you think is the greatest novelist in the history of English literature ? ,2
2556, Charles Dickens.Actually no one can parallel him in writing . ,1
2557, I'm afraid I can't agree with you on that . I like D.H.Laurence ' s novels better . ,1
2558,What game do you like ? ,2
2559, I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts . ,1
2560," I ’ Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ’ Ve seen old men playing it in the street . It looks complicated . ",1
2561," It ’ s about as complicated as chess . The basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn . ",1
2562, I like playing cards . I ’ m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ? ,2
2563," I ’ m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ’ d lose all my money . ",1
2564, Do you play bridge ? ,2
2565," Yes , I do . It ’ s hard to find four players though , so I don ’ t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game . ",1

2577, I'm afraid he's not in at the moment Dave . He went out about an hour ago and he's not back yet . ,4
2578, Any idea when he might be back ? ,2
2579," Well , he shouldn't be long . He said he was just going to get some paint . But I wouldn't be surprised if he's stopped off at the pub on the way back . ",1
2580," OK . well , tell him I've called , will you , and I'll try again later . ",3
2581," All right . Goodbye , Dave . ",4

2635, Sounds like we have the same idea . ,1
2636,Could you please tell me how I can go job-hunting in the web ? ,3
2637," Generally speaking , job seekers can enter the websites either of job agencies or of some units for job advertisements . ",3

3000, Oh really ? She gave me mine earlier today . ,1
3001," Well , she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today . ",1
3002," Yeah , so are you planning on going ? ",2
3003, I think so . It sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun . ,1
3004," It really does , I can't wait . ",1
3005, What time does the party start ? ,2
3006, It starts at 8 o'clock . ,1
3007," Oh , well , how many people has she given invites to so far ? ",2
3008," I'm not sure , but I don't think she's given out that many . ",1
3009," Well , hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today . ",1
3010,"After the financial crisis , many industries are in incredibly cloudy situations . How do you think about our company ? ",2
3011, The outlook in the future is very positive . Because we have been in this field for hundreds of years and we know how to survive this crisis safely . ,1
3012," As the department I am applying for is expanding , I would like to contribute by effort . ",3
3013, Great . Welcome to our company . ,4

3020, I'm with Hartford public relations . I'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services . ,3
3021, How about tomorrow at 11 o'clock ? ,3
3022,"Hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ? ",2
3023," Oh , don't mention it . It was terrible . ",1
3024, What ' the matter ? ,2
3025," The food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone . ",1
3026, I see . You simply can't blame the server for this . ,1
3027," Yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district . ",1
3028, That's true . ,1
3029," Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ? ",2
3030, It was good . I brought lunch from home today . ,1
3031, You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America . ,2
3032," Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy . ",1
3033," I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat . ",1
3034," Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ? ",2
3035, You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America . ,1
3036," Well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places . ",1
3037, Seriously ? ,2
3038," Yeah , it's hard to believe but true . ",1
3039,Have you seen this news article ? Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online . ,2
3040," Wow , that's really interesting . So who won ? ",2
3041," Well , the Great Wall of China , the Taj Mahal in India . ",1
3042," I've been there ! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art . The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds ! ",1
3043," Cool ! Also amongst the winners is Petra , in Jordan , Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico . ",1
3044," Wait a minute ! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders . I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator ! ",1
3045," Well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year . ",3
3046, Good idea ! ,4
3047,"Hello , I'd like to reserve a hotel room . ",3
3048," That should be no problem . May I have your full name , please ? ",3
3049, My name is John Sandals . ,1

3058," Next question , Is a queen-size bed okay ? ",3

3060," Okay , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is in our computer . All we need now is a phone number . ",3
3061, Certainly . My phone number is 626-555-1739 . ,1

3063,"Good evening , Pizza House . This is Marty speaking.May I take your order ? ",3

3065, We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas.Would you like a large pizza instead ? ,2
3066," Sure , that sounds good . ",1
3067, Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ? ,2
3068," No , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . Oh , and make it thin crust . ",1
3069," Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21.50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ’ s free ! ",3

We offer an online payment service , Personal Net Banking , which includes services such as account transfers , personal foreign exchange trading . You can also get account management services , online bill payment , for household bills like gas and electricity ... ",1
3075, That sounds good . At the moment I spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills . ,1
3076,I was surprised to see how few people you have on-site . You provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce . ,1
3077," It depends on the time of year . At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . We also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . We run a very tight operation ! ",1
3078, Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ? ,2
3079, Sometimes we use a local employment agency . It depends on the job . ,1
3080,"Jeff , look at this listing ! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . What do you think ? ",2
3081, Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ? ,2
3082," Hmm ... let me look . Yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building . ",1
3083," That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ? ",2
3084, It says it's located in the suburbs . ,1
3085,What would you like to have for dinner ? Chicken or beef ? ,2
3086," Chicken , please . ",3
3087, Good choice ! ,4
3088, What kind of drinks do you have ? ,2
3089," Well , we have all kinds of beverages in addition to fruit juices . ",1
3090," In that case , let me have a glass of orange juice . ",3
3091, Anything else ? ,2
3092, I would like to have some tea as well . ,3
3093, Another flight attendant is coming down the aisle with coffee and tea . ,1

3095,I'd like to apply for a credit card . Can you help me with my application ? ,3
3096, I'd be glad to . ,4
3097, I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history . I just came to this country . ,1
3098, Do you have an account with this bank ? ,2
3099, I'm afraid not . ,1
3100, In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . That would help with your credit card application . ,3
3101, What is the interest rate on your card ? ,2
3102, The annual charge rate is 9.5 % . ,1
3103, That's very expensive ! ,1
3104, Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe . ,1
3105, How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ? ,2
3106, You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized . ,1
3107, Does the card provide any other benefits ? ,2
3108," You can also get a cash advance up to 1,000 dollars on this card . ",1
3109,"You're really fit , Paul . Do you exercise very much ? ",2
3110," Well , I almost always get up very early , and I lift weights for an hour . ",1
3111, You're kidding ! ,1
3112, No . And then I often go Rollerblading . ,1
3113, Wow ! How often do you exercise like that ? ,2
3114, About five times a week . What about you ? ,2
3115," Oh , I hardly ever exercise . I usually just watch TV in my free time . I guess I'm a real couch potato ! ",1
3116,I don't believe we've met . ,2
3117," No , I don't think we have . ",1
3118, My name is Gao Run . ,1
3119, How do you do ? My name is James Green . ,1
3120, Here's my name card . ,3

3142,The plumbing in my new apartment is not working . ,1
3143, I need you to tell me what the problem is . ,3
3144, The bathroom sink is stopped up . ,1
3145," Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also , or just the bathroom plumbing ? ",2
3146, Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem . ,1
3147," Did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ? ",2
3148, Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago . ,1
3149, Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem ? ,3

3159," Little dude , your life is over ! ",4
3160, No time to worry . We have to dispose of this evidence . ,3
3161,How old is Keith ? ,2
3162, He's 21 . How old is James ? ,1
3163," He's a year older than Keith , but he looks younger . ",1
3164, How's your father ? ,2
3165, He's fine . He retired last week . It's a turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . ,1
3166, He can spend more time with his grandchildren . ,1
3167," Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world . ",1
3168," So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea ! ",1
3169, How do you want to spend your old age ? ,2
3170," In the same way , probably . ",1
3171,Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ? ,3
3172," Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume . ",3
3173, But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ? ,4
3174," Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume . ",3
3175," It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ? ",2
3176," Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer . ",1
3177,Why not come over to work in my company ? ,3
3178, I need to think it over . ,4
3179, Tell me what you need . ,3
3180," All right . I'm prepared to , if the pay is reasonable . ",4
3181,We are approaching the top of the mountain . ,1
3182, What a beautiful view we have here . ,1
3183," Yes , you can have a bird's-eye view of the whole city . ",1
3184, Wonderful . Will we have any free time there ? ,2
3185, Of course . We will stay there for half an hour and you can do your own business . ,1
3186,what did you do last night ? ,2
3187, I just stayed at home and watched TV . ,1
3188, did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ? ,2
3189," yes , it was a very evenly matched game . ",1
3190, what were the results of the game ? ,2
3191, it ended in a tie . ,1
3192, what was the actual score ? ,2
3193, it was three all . ,1
3194, really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid . ,1
3195," if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . ",1
3196, what happened ? ,2
3197," their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway . ",1
3198, that explains it . ,1
3199, how many more games are left this season ? ,2
3200, that was the last game before the playoffs . ,1
3201, when do the playoffs start ? ,2
3202, in a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ? ,2
3203, of course ! I really love watching football games on TV . ,1
3204," Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . ",3
3205," sure , that would be great . ",4
3206," Ok , it's a date then ! ",1
3207,how are you ? ,2
3208," I ’ m fine , thanks . Just trying to get adjusted . It ’ s hard to keep track of everything around here . ",1
3209," That ’ s for sure . You ’ re new , too , huh ? ",2
3210, Yeah . I just got here a couple of days ago . How about you ? ,2
3211,"Excuse me . I bought this shirt yesterday , but I would like to refund it . ",3
3212," Gave me the receipt , please . ",3
3213, Here is my receipt . ,4
3214, What's wrong with it ? ,2
3215, It's too small for me to wear . ,1
3216, Would you like another bigger one ? ,2
3217, No thanks . I want to have a refund . ,1
3218," OK , here is your money . ",1
3219,"Oh , so many kinds of winter hats . ",1
3220," What is your favorite color , miss ? ",2
3221, Red . ,1
3222, Here you are.It ' s very attractive . ,1
3223, May I try it on ? ,3
3224, Go ahead . ,4
3225, Is there a mirror around here ? ,2
3226, Right over there . ,1
3227, Does it suit me ? ,2
3228," Yes , you look very nice . ",1
3229, How much is it ? ,2
3230, We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax . ,1
3231, That's quite reasonable . ,1
3232,What can I help you with ? ,2
3233, May I ask you something ? ,3
3234, What's your question ? ,2
3235, How many hours behind the wheel do I need ? ,2
3236, What do you need to take it for ? ,2
3237, I'm trying to get my license . ,1
3238, You need six hours . ,1
3239, Can I do all six hours in one day ? ,3
3240, You have to do it in three days . ,4
3241, That's all I have to do ? ,2
3242, That's everything . ,1
3243," Well , that's a relief . ",1
3244,"Excuse me , I have something to trouble you . ",3
3245, Yes ? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you . ,4
3246," An hour ago , I bought this vase with my tourist . ",1
3247," Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ? ",2
3248, I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel . ,1
3249," Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ? ",3
3250," Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes . ",4
3251, It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ? ,3
3252, All right . Thank you . ,4
3253," Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully . ",3
3254," Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one . ",4
3255, I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you . ,1
3256," Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing . ",1
3257,Here you are . You left the medicine here . ,1
3258, Sorry . I was too worried . ,1
3259, I firmly believe that you love your brother very much . ,1
3260," Absolutely . By the way , do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine ? ",2
3261," Yes , we have some Chinese medicine for common cold . ",1
3262, I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure . ,1
3263, It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention . ,3
3264,What kind of place shall we rent ? ,2
3265," It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up . ",1
3266, Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat . ,1
3267," Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ? ",2
3268," I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home . ",1
3269," Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us . ",3
3270," Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early . ",4
3271, How much do you think the rent will be ? ,2
3272, I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month . ,1
3273,I have a terrible toothache . ,1
3274, Which tooth is it ? ,2
3275, This one here . ,3
3276," Ar , Yes . There ’ s a big cavity . ",1
3277, Can you fill it ? ,2
3278, I ’ m afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out . ,3
3279, Then I might as well have it done now . ,4
3280," you ’ d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days . ",3
3281,"May I have a look at that vase , please ? ",3
3282, Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan . ,4
3283," Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive . ",1
3284, Really ? Even for such an excellent one ? ,2
3285,Can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment ? ,3
3286, The local newspaper has ads for housing . ,4
3287, Is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ? ,2
3288, Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate . ,1
3289, What do landlords charge for rent ? ,2
3290," Would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ? ",2
3291," There are two of us , but we only need a one-bedroom apartment . ",1
3292, You should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month . ,1
3293, I really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me . ,3
3294," Sure , I ’ ll go look at apartments with you anytime you want . ",4
3295,"Excuse me , would you please do me a favor ? ",3
3296, With pleasure . ,4
3297, I appreciate the building so much . I am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building . ,3
3298, No problem . ,4
3299,The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge . ,1
3300," Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford . ",1
3301, Why is the price so high ? ,2
3302," It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly . ",1
3303, Model of computers aren't compatible ? ,2
3304, Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities . ,1
3305," Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable . ",1
3306," But by then , the technology will be outdated . ",1
3307," True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge . ",1
3308," That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable . ",1
3309," This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product . ",1
3310, I guess you get what you pay for . ,1
3311,What kind of permanent would you like to have ? ,2
3312, what kinds do you have ? ,2
3313," Oh , yeah , It ’ s quite of variety . Regular , cold perm , straight perm , pink curl and form . ",1
3314," Last time I tried a pink curl perm and form permanent . Set the wave a little loose than as usual , please . ",3
3315,Hello ! How do I get more amenities ? ,3
3316," I'm sorry , sir . I'm not sure I understand . ",4
3317," I'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo . ",1
3318," Oh , I see . So , you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities . ",1
3319," No , no . I've got plenty left . ",1
3320, Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ? ,2
3321, What am I going to do about souvenirs ? ,1
3322," Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs ! ",1
3323," Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs . ",1
3324," Sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount . ",3
3325, Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs . ,4
3326," I understand completely , sir . Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment . ",4
3327,Excuse me . Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ? ,2
3328," Well , you can take the No . 36 bus from here , but then you have to walk about 30 minutes . ",1
3329, That doesn't sound too bad . ,1
3330," Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo . ",1
3331, Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot . ,1
3332, You're welcome . ,1
3333,"I'd like to order breakfast , please . ",3
3334," What'd you like , madam ? ",2

3339, How may I help you ? ,2
3340, Could you cancel a check for me ? ,3
3341, What ’ s the problem ? ,2
3342, I wrote the check out for way too much . ,1
3343, How much ? ,2
3344, I wrote the check out for $ 150 . ,1
3345, What were you supposed to write it out for ? ,2
3346, I was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 . ,1
3347, I ’ ll just cancel it for you right now . ,4
3348, That ’ s great . You ’ re a lifesaver . ,1
3349,"Would you like to take a look at the menu , sir ? ",3
3350, Yes . Thank you . ,4
3351, Would you care for a drink before you order ? ,3
3352, A glass of Qingdao beer . ,3
3353," Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ? ",4
3354, Will you make some recommendation ? ,3
3355,"I ’ m taking BA fright 123 to London . Can you tell me where the reporting desk is , please ? ",3
3356," Yes , Madam . The reporting desk for the British Airway's flight to London is over there . ",1
3357, Thank you so much . Is this the desk for BA flight 123 to London ? ,2
3358," Yes , this is the right desk . Have you any luggage ? ",1
3359," The suitcase , that ’ s all . Except my handbag . Of course . ",1
3360, Would you please put you suitcase on the scales ? You needn ’ t weigh your handbag . ,3
3361, Is there a receipt ? ,2
3362, Yes . I ’ ll attach your baggage receipt to your ticket . ,1
3363, What must I do next ? ,3
3364, You must go to immigration to the departure lounge . ,4
3365,It's time for bed . ,1
3366," But I'm not sleepy , Mum . Can I stay and watch more TV ? ",3
3367," It's already half past eleven . You have school tomorrow . You'll sleepy all tomorrow , if you don't sleep well tonight . ",3
3368, I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard . ,4
3369, Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those . ,2
3370," Oh , I nearly forgot the exams . ",1
3371," You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ? ",2
3372," Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow . ",1
3373, An excellent idea . Work now and play later . ,3
3374," I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed . ",3
3375," No , now it's bedtime . ",4
3376,"Yes , madam ? Can I help you ? ",2
3377," Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ? ",2
3378," Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes . ",1
3379, I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week . ,1
3380," Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ? ",2
3381," Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ? ",2
3382, That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ? ,2
3383," Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them . ",1
3384," I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans . ",1
3385," I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday . ",1
3386," Well , it's all new stock in the window now . ",1
3387," May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ? ",3
3388," Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing . ",4
3389," Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ’ d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot . ",1
3390," Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price . ",3
3391," Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color . ",4
3392," That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ’ s exactly what you are looking for . ",1
3393," There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones . ",1
3394,I've come to hear about your offer . ,3
3395," We have the offer ready for you . Let me check . 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box , at 20,000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box , at 30,000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box , at 7 , 500 yuan , for shipment in June . The offer is valid for five days . ",1
3396, I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected . ,3
3397, You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where . ,4
3398, I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies . ,3
3399," But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with . ",4
3400, I agree that yours are of the top . ,1
3401," Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ? ",2
3402," To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help . ",3
3403, Impossible . How about 5 % off ? ,3
3404, Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable . ,4
3405,So I'm on the fifth floor ? How come this hotel has no fourth floor . ,2
3406," Four is an unlucky number here , Peter.Four sounds like death in Chinese.Hotels often have no fourth floor . ",1
3407," I see.Oh , I know what I wanted to ask.How much should I tip this guy ? ",2
3408," People don't usually tip here , but you can.Fifty dollars should be more enough . ",3
3409,Hello ! This is Ruby speaking from G . O . T . International Travel Agency . What can I do for you ? ,2
3410, I ’ d like to make a reservation for my trip from Detroit to Beijing on April 13 on Trans Pacific Airline . ,3
3411, Do you want a single ticket or a round trip ticket ? ,2

3414," Economy , please . How much is it ? ",2
3415, It will be $ 850 . ,1
3416, Very good . Could I get an electronic ticket ? I ’ m always afraid of losing my tickets . ,3

3419, Thank you ! Would you like an aisle seat or a window seat ? ,2
3420," An aisle seat , please . I ’ m tall and need to get up and walk pretty often . ",3
3421, No problem . Your ticket is for Trans Pacific Flight 87 from Detroit to Beijing at 3 forty p . m . on April 13 . You will arrive at Beijing International Airport at six 35 p . m . on April 14 . Your electronic ,1
3422, What time should I arrive at Detroit Airport ? ,2
3423, Please be at the airport two hours before your departure to check in . You also need to reconfirm your reservation with the airline at least 7 days prior to your departure . ,3
3424, What happens if I can ’ t leave on April 13 ? Can I cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date ? ,2
3425," Yes , you can , but you will have to pay a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation . ",1
3426, That ’ s OK . What are the weight restrictions for checked baggage ? ,2
3427," On Trans Pacific international flights , each ticketed passenger is permitted a maximum of two checked bags with a maximum weight per checked bag of 70 pounds . ",1
3428, That ’ s great ! I can have two bags checked for 70 pounds each . I think I ’ m all set . You ’ re really efficient . Thank you very much for your help . ,1
3429, Thank you for the compliment and for calling G . O . T . Travel Agency . Have a nice trip ! ,1
3430,I do want to meet with you and take a look at your catalogue . We ’ re redecorating and are going to add some things . ,3
3431," Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . I can come out anytime on Tuesday or Thursday of next week . ",3
3432, Let ’ s put it down for 1:15 on Thursday . We ’ ll definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . ,3
3433, Fine . I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on Thursday . ,4
3434,That looks graceful on you . ,1
3435, Thank you.But it is too bright for me . ,1
3436, How about this brown one ? ,3
3437, Let me try it on . I like that color . ,3
3438," Ok , i will get one for your.Here you are . ",4
3439, But it is too loose.Do you have the smaller size ? ,2
3440," Sorry , it had been sold out . ",1
3441, What a pity ! ,1
3442,I ’ d like to apply for a personal loan . ,3
3443, How much would you like to borrow ? ,2
3444, A thousand dollars . ,3
3445, Let me check with a credit manager . A record show your credit reading is quite high . I don't think you have any problems . ,4
3446, What ’ s the current interest rate ? ,2
3447, Our monthly interest is 1.5 % of the outstanding balance . Would you please fill out the application the form ? ,3
3448,And there's a little upside-down Dilbert on the underside . ,1
3449," When you flip the tie up , he's right side up . Brilliant . ",1
3450, My dad will love this . He's a Dilbert fan . ,1
3451, I wouldn't mind having one myself ... ,1
3452, Model it for me . ,3
3453, OK ! ,4
3454, Wow ! You look just as dorky as Dilbert ! ,1
3455,"Welcome . What can I do for you , Madam ? ",2
3456," I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ? ",3
3457," That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service . ",3
3458, A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ? ,2
3459," A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle . ",1
3460," But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you . ",2
3461," We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies . ",1
3462," I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free . ",4
3463,Hello . ,1
3464, Hi . It ’ s Tony calling from the dentist ’ s office . Is Lily there ? ,2
3465," No , Lily is not here at the moment . ",1
3466, Could you ask her to call me back when she gets in ? ,2
3467," Sure . What ’ s your number , please . ",3
3468, 519 367 8901 . ,4
3469," Thanks . And your name is Tony , right ? ",2
3470, Yes . I ’ m Tony . Thank you very much . ,1
3471, You ’ re welcome . Bye . ,1
3472, Bye . ,1
3473,So what do you think of my new dress ? ,2
3474," I think it's great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now , but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment . ",1
3475," Um , ninety-five dollars ? ",2
3476," Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ? ",2
3477, I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else . ,1
3478," Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ? ",2
3479," I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive . ",1
3480,Who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ? ,2
3481, I did . Why ? ,2
3482, Didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ? ,2
3483," No , I didn't . I'm sorry . It won't happen again . ",1
3484,Is it Fred's fault ? ,2
3485," No , I don't suppose he's to blame.The man in the other car made a mistake . ",1
3486, But he's equally responsible because he tried to overtake you . ,1
3487,"In foreign trade , exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner . ",1
3488, How to adjust ? ,2
3489," Exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs , wants and likes . ",1
3490," Ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas . ",1
3491," That's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably . ",1
3492," Yes , sometimes the differences are great . ",1
3493," Well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product . ",1
3494, We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales . ,1
3495,I hate doing the damn laundry . ,1
3496, Watch your language . ,3
3497,I want to buy three tickets . What's the entrance fee ? ,2
3498, $ 10 per person . ,1
3499," Here are $ 30 . By the way , where can I find a guide ? ",2
3500, Turn to the next window and they will help you find one . ,1
3501, Thanks a lot . ,1
3502,Shall we share a taxi ? ,3
3503, Where are you heading now ? ,2
3504, I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road.It is very close to your house . ,1
3505, Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ? ,2
3506, That's the one . ,1
3507, You mean we'll share the taxi ? ,2
3508," Yeah.If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper.Besides that your Chinese is better than mine.The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully . ",1
3509," Well.Don ' t worry about it , I will be happy to share the taxi with you . ",1
3510,Good morning.Are you Mr.Liu ? ,2
3511, My name is Liu Lichi . How do you do ? ,2
3512," How do you do ? Please be seated , How is your trip here ? ",2
3513," Quite good , I think . I came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes . ",1
3514," Oh , yes.How old are you ? ",2
3515, Twenty . ,1
3516," Hum , still a student ? ",2
3517," Yes , I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics . ",1
3518, What subjects are you studying ? ,2
3519," English , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy . ",1
3520, Have you had any working experience . ,2
3521," Well , I worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays . ",1
3522, What do you like to do in your spare time ? ,2
3523," I like sports very much.Besides that , I also like working on a computer in my spare time . ",1
3524, How are your English and computer skills ? ,2
3525, I have passed the CET - 4 and 6.As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing . ,1
3526," Okay . Mr.Liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week . ",3
3527,That dress is very pretty . Why don ’ t you like it ? ,2
3528, It ’ s too loud . ,1
3529, We ’ Ve been looking around for many hours.What on earth are you looking for ? ,2
3530," Well , you know , those styles or colors don ’ t suit me . ",1
3531, What style do you want ? ,2
3532," I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight . ",1
3533," Oh , I see.How about the color ? ",2
3534, Quiet color . ,1
3535, I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters . ,3
3536, Really ? Let ’ s go there . ,4
3537,"Hey Julie , you want to go grab something to eat ? ",2
3538, Sure ! What do you feel like having ? ,2
3539, I really feel like having a big juicy steak ! ,1
3540," Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ? ",2
3541, I didn't know you were a vegetarian ! ,1
3542," I'm not , I am a vegan . ",1
3543, A what ? ,2
3544," A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood . ",1
3545, Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough ! ,1
3546," It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult . ",1
3547,How do you feel about that restaurant ? ,2
3548, It wasn't all that great . ,1
3549, What did you dislike the most ? ,2
3550, I don't think that they had their act together . They didn't seem well prepared . ,1
3551, Did you think that the food was any good ? ,2
3552, I wasn't all that impressed by the food . ,1
3553, The service certainly could have been better . ,1
3554, The service did not help the situation . ,1
3555, Is this a restaurant that you want to come back to ? ,2
3556, I am not interested in trying this restaurant again . ,1
3557,Let me see your passport . Is London your final destination ? ,2
3558, No . I am a transit passenger going to Sweden . ,1
3559, How long are you going to stay here ? ,2
3560, Only one night . ,1
3561, Do you have any dutiable items ? ,2
3562," No , I don't . ",1
3563, What are these ? ,2
3564, They are my personal effects . ,1
3565,"I heard that you finished my home inspection , and I was wondering how it went . ",2
3566," First of all , we need to understand what I was looking for . Do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ? ",2
3567, I am not sure what a home inspection is all about . ,1
3568," I went there to check for problems with the home , so you aren ’ t surprised when you move in . ",1
3569, Wouldn ’ t the owners have told me about any problems ? ,2
3570," Sellers aren ’ t always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren ’ t aware of . ",1
3571, Can I require the owners to fix the problems ? ,3
3572, You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems . ,4
3573, What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ? ,2
3574, There were no major problems . One leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that I found . ,1
3575,How you celebrate your Valentine ’ s Day with your wife ? ,2
3576, I will take a rain check . ,1
3577,Yesterday I had a quarrel with my roommate . I'm really fed up with all this . ,1
3578, Tell me what seems to be the problem . ,3
3579," My roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . They stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while I have no place for study . I even don't have the quietness to sleep . ",4
3580, Did you ever talk to him about it ? ,2
3581,What can I do for you today ? ,2
3582, I have a question . ,3
3583, What do you need to know ? ,2
3584, I need to take the driver's course . How many hours do I need ? ,2
3585, It depends on what you're trying to do with the completion of the course . ,1
3586, I need to get my license . ,3
3587, You're going to need to complete six hours . ,4
3588, How many hours a day can I do ? ,2
3589, You can do two hours a day for three days . ,1
3590, That's all I need to do to finish ? ,2
3591," Yes , that's all you need to do . ",1
3592, Thanks . I'll get back to you . ,1
3593,Would you like your bags to be taken to your room ? ,3
3594," Yes , please . ",4

3598," Please be careful with the suitcase , it's very heavy . ",3
3599," I'll let the bellboy know . Don't worry , he's very strong . ",4
3600," And the holdall has some fragile items inside , so please be careful with that too . ",3
3601, Of course . ,4
3602,How far do we have to go ? ,2
3603, About 50 miles . ,1
3604," The traffic is not very heavy on this high way , is it ? So I ’ m sure we ’ ll make it . ",2
3605," No , but we ’ Ve got a hurry . It will be the rush hour soon . ",1
3606, Don ’ t worry . There ’ s plenty of time yet . ,1
3607," But it ’ s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ’ t it ? ",2
3608, Right . ,1
3609,Hello ! I'm sorry to bother you . This is a complimentary fruit tray . Your food will be ready soon . ,3
3610, Wow ! It's a fruit sculpture ! Your chef is a real artist ! ,4
3611," Actually , uh , I made it myself ... ",1
3612, You did ? Wow ! Where did you learn ... ,2
3613," Sorry , but I've gotta run . Enjoy your food , and ring the service button if you need anything else ! ",3
3614,How can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever ? ,2
3615," With the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired . ",1
3616, I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime . ,1
3617, Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ? ,2
3618, He must have just got online for the first time last week . He still thinks it's some kind of new toy . ,1
3619,"Okay , so we're agreed on 900 . ",1
3620, I'm happy with that price . ,1
3621, Let's shake on it . ,3
3622," Okay , let's shake on it . ",4
3623,May I help you ? ,2
3624," Give me a Big Mac , a small order of French fries and a medium Coke . ",1
3625, You'll need to wait a few minutes for the fries . They are still in the fryer . ,3
3626, That's fine . ,4
3627, Your total comes to $ 7 . ,1
3628, Here's a twenty . Could you give me some more napkins ? ,3
3629, Sure . Your cash back is $ 13 . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes . ,4
3630, Thanks . ,1
3631,"Let me tell you some more . The interest is settled on the 20th of the last month in each quarter , It's paid quarterly . Of course it also needs to be settled if you cancel the account . ",1
3632," Miao Ping , in your opinion , should we go for the Type A or Type B Account ? ",2
3633," Well , the Type B Account is very restricted . If your aim is to use the account the same way as your use your Settlement Account , I would recommend the Type A Account for you . ",3
3634, Thanks for your time . I'll go and discuss everything with my partner and I'll be back later . ,1
3635,"Sarah , you don't look so good . What's the matter ? ",2

3992, Can I get you anything to drink ? : ,3
3993," Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea . ",4
3994, Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad . ,1
3995, Thank you . ,1
3996,"Do you want to help me make the cookies , Anna ? ",2
3997, I'd love to . ,1
3998," First , put away your toys . ",3
3999, OK . ,4
4000, I'll get the flour out . ,1
4001, Let me help you . ,1
4002,We have made some adjustment on the prices . And this is renewed price list . ,3
4003," Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side . ",4
4004," This is our rock-bottom price , and we can't make any further reduction . ",3
4005," If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks . ",4
4006, Then what ’ s your counter-offer ? ,2
4007, This is our counter-offer . ,1
4008," We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great . ",3
4009, So are we . Our counter-offer is in line with the world market . ,3
4010, How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ? ,3
4011, Agreed . ,4
4012,What do you usually have for breakfast ? Pancakes or waffles ? ,2
4013, I usually have cereal for breakfast . ,1
4014, But isn't it served with cold milk ? ,2
4015, Yeah . Cold milk wakes me up . ,1
4016, Chinese people don't like to eat cold food . ,1
4017, Is that right ? ,2
4018," But I'm open to new things . I'll have a bowl of cereal , too . ",1
4019, With cold milk ? ,2
4020, With cold milk ! ,1
4021,I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season . ,1
4022," That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . ",1
4023, It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ? ,2
4024," That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it . ",1
4025, Certainly . ,1
4026,"Hi , I need to copy something right now . ",3
4027," Our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine , sir . ",1
4028, Great ! How much per copy ? ,2
4029," Sir , one copy is ten cents . ",1
4030," Okay , I'll be down there shortly . ",1
4031," You probably won't have to wait for anyone , sir . ",1
4032,"Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific ! ",1
4033," Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that . ",1
4034," No , we just don ’ t usually admit it ! ",1
4035," Well , thanks for the compliment anyway ! ",1
4036,This Olympic park is so big ! ,1
4037," Yes . Now we are in the Olympic stadium , the center of this park . ",1
4038, Splendid ! When is it gonna be finished ? ,2
4039, The whole stadium is to be finished this June . ,1
4040, How many seats are there in the stand ? ,2
4041," Oh , there are 5000 seats in total . ",1
4042, I didn ’ t know it would be so big ! ,1
4043," It is ! Look there , those are the tracks . And the jumping pit is over there . ",1
4044," Ah ... I see . Hey , look the sign here , No climbing . ",1
4045, We put many signs with English translations for foreign visitors . ,1
4046,"It's located in the suburbs ? Well even though that sounds like a steal , I really want something downtown . ",1
4047, OK . Well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive . ,1
4048," I know , that's my problem . What do you think I should do ? ",2
4049," Well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate . ",1
4050," Oh , great idea ! ",1
4051,"So , Monica , how do you like your new office ? ",2
4052," Well , I love it . The room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place ! ",1
4053, That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful . ,1
4054, What was so bad about it ? ,2
4055," Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work . ",1
4056, Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently . ,1
4057," Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor . ",3
4058,"Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ? ",2
4059," Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 . ",1
4060," Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction . ",1
4061," Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically . ",1
4062," Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ? ",2
4063," Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student magazine , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York . ",1
4064, What did that involve ? ,2
4065," Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . ",1
4066," I ’ m sure . Okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ? ",3
4067," Yes , okay . ",4
4068,"Could you change these for me , please ? ",3
4069, What would you like ? ,2
4070," Twenties and some smaller bills , please . ",3
4071, Anything else ? ,2
4072, Yes . Could you tell many balance ? Here's account number . ,3
4073,"Now , what seems to be the trouble ? ",2
4074," It's nothing serious . But I always have a headache , and I haven't slept properly for several weeks . I've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning . ",1
4075," Mm , you do look rather pale . Let me take your temperature . Would you put the thermometer under your arm , please ? Now , let me listen to your pulse . Mm , do you feel weak ? ",2
4076," Yes , I never seem to have any energy . ",1
4077, I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest . ,3
4078, Thank you . ,4
4079,"Excuse me , I would like to know something about this campus . Right now it seems very big and confusing ! I have no idea where I am going or what I am doing . ",3
4080, Do you have a map of the campus ? ,2
4081," Yes , I have , but it doesn ’ t help me very much . I ’ m not very good at reading maps . ",1
4082, Do you know where your classes are ? ,2
4083," More or less . I go to three different buildings , and always get there late . I feel so hopeless . I don ’ t know why I am late all the time . No one else seems to be . ",1
4084, That's because you don't know the short cuts . You'll learn them after a while . I can show you the ropes . ,4
4085,"Good morning , I would like to reserve a berth . ",3
4086, Which train do you like ? ,2
4087, T112 to Washington please . ,1
4088, May I have your name ? ,3
4089, That's Lincoln . ,4
4090,Will you be voting ? ,2
4091, I can ’ t wait to vote . ,1
4092, Who are you voting for ? ,2
4093, The person I ’ m voting for is the best . ,1
4094, What do you like about him ? ,2
4095, He is very intelligent . ,1
4096, You think so ? ,2
4097," That ’ s right . Plus , I agree with his policies . ",1
4098, I ’ m glad to hear that you are so excited . ,1
4099, I ’ m voting for the next President . ,1
4100, I ’ m sure he will be . ,1
4101, I ’ m going to make sure and vote . ,1
4102,Good morning . May I help you ? ,2
4103," Yes , I'd like to check out now . My name's Adams , room 312 . Here's the key . ",3
4104," One moment , please , sir . ... Here's your bill . Would you like to check and see if the amount is correct ? ",3
4105, What's the 14 pounds for ? ,2
4106, That's for the phone calls you made from your room . ,1
4107, Can I pay with traveller's cheques ? ,3
4108," Certainly . May I have your passport , please ? ",3
4109, Here you are . ,4
4110, Could you sign each cheque here for me ? ,3
4111, Sure . ,4
4112," Here are your receipt and your change , sir . Thank you . ",1
4113, Thank you . Goodbye . ,1
4114,What type of people do you work with most effectively ? ,2
4115," I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive . ",1
4116, What things impress you in your colleagues ? ,2
4117, I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment . ,1
4118, What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ? ,2
4119," The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior . ",1
4120, How do you organize and plan for major projects ? ,2
4121," I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react . ",1
4122, Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure . ,3
4123," I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed . ",1
4124, How do you manage your time in a typical day ? ,2
4125," I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week . ",1
4126, Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion . ,3
4127, I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings . ,1
4128,"Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ? ",2
4129," Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth ! ",1
4130, I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better . ,1
4131, Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards . ,1
4132, It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case . ,1
4133,I am sorry to have kept all of you waiting . I was delayed by something urgent . ,1
4134," You are not late , Mr . Thomas . There're still 15 minutes to go . Mr . White has just called you . ",1
4135, What did he say ? ,2
4136," He said there was a traffic jam , but he is coming . ",1
4137, He shouldn't drive his car . He should come here by bus . ,1
4138,Want to send out for some Chinese ? ,2
4139, Some what ? ,2
4140," Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat . ",1
4141," No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ? ",3
4142," Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like . ",4
4143, Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ? ,2
4144," Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered . ",1
4145, What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste . ,2
4146, Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag . ,1
4147,Do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ? ,2
4148, I know something about it . Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills . ,1
4149," It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so I can not bear it anymore . It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills . ",1
4150, Is that true ? ,2
4151, Definitely ! ,1
4152," If that information is exact , I guess our company is willing to promote someone . ",1
4153,"Hello sir , how may I help you ? ",2
4154," I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice . ",3
4155," I see , may I ask what the occasion is ? ",3
4156," It ’ s not really an occasion , it ’ s more like I ’ m sorry . ",4
4157, Very well.This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness . ,3
4158, I think I ’ m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ? ,4
4159," Mmm , well this is our I ’ m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you . ",3
4160, I don ’ t think that ’ s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better ! ,4
4161," I ’ m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ? ",2
4162," Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier . ",1
4163," Get out of my store , you jerk ! ",3
4164,I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ? ,2
4165," I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel . ",1
4166, You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ? ,2
4167, I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here . ,1
4168," Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well . ",1
4169," Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list . ",1
4170, How many people are on the waiting list right now ? ,2
4171, Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 . ,1
4172,How do you think they could be ended ? ,2
4173, I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . ,1
4174," So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources , share them . ",1
4175," It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it's harder to make peace between countries . ",1
4176," Yes , it is.One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . ",1
4177,You still have not given me those files I ’ Ve asked you for . ,3
4178," I ’ m sorry , Mr . Myers . I ’ Ve just been so busy today . ",4
4179," I really don ’ t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ’ re running a busy office here . You ’ re going to have to keep up . ",3
4180," You ’ re right , sir . I apologize . I ’ ll get those files for you now . ",4
4181,What sort of job would you like to take ? ,2
4182, I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator . ,3
4183, We need an operator now . ,3
4184, It's just the job I've been searching for . ,1
4185,I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past . ,1
4186, I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process . ,1
4187, And it takes up all the news . ,1
4188, The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up . ,1
4189," It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public . ",1
4190, Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio . ,1
4191, I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio . ,1
4192, Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line . ,3
4193,"Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ? ",3
4194, I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ? ,3
4195, Sure . No problem . ,4
4196," Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ? ",3
4197, Sure . Do you have my number ? ,2
4198," Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this . ",1
4199, No problem . I'll wait for your call . ,4
4200,What are you typing there ? ,2
4201, I'm working on my resume . ,1
4202, Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ? ,2
4203," Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet . ",1
4204, Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ? ,2
4205, I didn ’ t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good . ,1
4206, Maybe I should try looking on the web for work . ,1
4207, Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls . ,3
4208, But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance . ,4
4209, How do you know if you don ’ t have a try ? ,3
4210,Would you please show me the necklace in the window ? ,3
4211, Is this the one you want ? ,2
4212," No , the one next to it . ",1
4213, Here you are . ,1
4214, Thanks . What kind of stone is this ? ,2
4215, It's a ruby . It is from South Africa . Would you like to try it on ? ,2
4216," Yes , please . How much is it ? ",2
4217, It costs $ 200 . ,1
4218, It looks good . OK . I'll take it . ,1
4219,"Happy birthday , Jim ! ",3
4220," Thank you , Lisa . ",4
4221, Here is a present for you . I hope you like it . ,3
4222," Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time . ",4
4223, I'm very glad to hear that . ,1
4224," Come here , let me introduce some friends to you . ",1
4225,What's wrong with you ? You look pale . ,2
4226," I'm not sure , I feel hot and cold . ",1
4227, When did the trouble start ? ,2
4228, I was sick most of the night . ,1
4229, It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature . ,3
4230, Have I got a high fever ? ,2
4231," Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ? ",2
4232," Yes , I have . ",1
4233," Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - ' ",3
4234," Aaaaahh , aaaaahh . ",1
4235," Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests . ",3
4236," All right , thanks . ",4
4237, The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection . ,1
4238, What shall I do today ? ,2
4239," I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription . ",3
4240,I have to check out today . I'd like my bill ready by 10 this morning . ,3
4241," You can be sure of that , sir . ",4
4242, Thank you . ,1
4243,I called HP about my computer . ,1
4244, What did they say ? ,2
4245, They said I need a new hard drive . ,1
4246, That's too bad . How much is a new one ? ,2
4247," It's not too much , only about $ 85 . ",1
4248, Plus installation ? ,2
4249," No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace . ",1
4250, Really ? ,2
4251," Yes , it's just a couple of screws . ",1
4252, That's nice . ,1
4253, It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 . ,1
4254," If my hard drive crashes , I'll just call you . ",3
4255,"Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class . ",1
4256, Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night . ,3
4257," Yes , Mum . ",4
4258,Is there anything wrong ? ,2
4259, I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college . ,1
4260, Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager . ,1
4261, I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything . ,1
4262, You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision . ,3
4263, But I just want to give her some tips . ,4
4264," Oh , she can make her own decisions . ",1
4265, I guess you are right . ,1
4266, Believe me . Everything will be ok . ,3
4267, I hope so . ,4
4268,It's beautiful here . ,1
4269, Yes . I feel refreshed . ,1
4270, How long will we dock ? ,2
4271, In half an hour . The surface of the lake is calm . ,1
4272, Yes . We come at the right time . ,1
4273,"that was a really good meal , Gordon . ",1
4274, It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite . ,1
4275," well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home . ",3
4276, you're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow . ,4
4277, let's see how much the bill is . ,3
4278, don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat . ,4
4279, what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill . ,2
4280," no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't . ",1
4281," no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill . ",3
4282," alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill . ",4
4283," that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk . ",1
4284," just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ? ",3
4285, you've got a deal . ,4
4286, great . Bye . ,1
4287, bye . ,1
4288,I hear you are planning to travel abroad . ,1
4289, Yes . I'm going to the Untied States for travel . What places do you recommend ? ,2
4290," In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles . ",1
4291, Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii . ,1
4292," Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight . ",3
4293, And Seattle is the home of Microsoft and Boeing . That must be a great place . I can't miss it . ,4
4294,This looks like a very nice house . ,1
4295," You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it . ",1
4296, The style of the exterior is just what I ’ Ve been looking for ! ,1
4297, The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible . ,1
4298, This home is gorgeous on the inside ! ,1
4299," Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new . ",1
4300, The wall colors totally suit the style of this house . ,1
4301, Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen . ,1
4302, I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops . ,1
4303, The master suite is the best . Let ’ s go look at that next . ,3
4304," There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room . ",4
4305," I know that you like this house , but let ’ s take a look at the others before you make up your mind . ",3
4306,Room service.What can I do for you ? ,2

4314, Will that be first class or economy seat ? ,2
4315, What's the fare for a first class seat ? ,2
4316, $ 200 . ,1
4317, Oh . I am not a wall streeter.Give me an economy one please . ,3
4318,"Hello , Sir . So , you are back ? ",2
4319," Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit . ",3
4320," That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate . ",1
4321, And I can purchase that here ? ,3
4322," Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle . ",4
4323,Are there any beds vacant ? ,2
4324," Yes , what kind of room do you want ? ",2
4325," I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower . ",3
4326," Sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower . ",4
4327," Well , that's fine . ",1
4328,Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company . ,2
4329, That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me . ,1
4330, You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ? ,2
4331," Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t ",1
4332," Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ? ",1
4333," Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff . ",1
4334," Well , welcome to the team . ",1
4335,Good afternoon . I've brought the extra blanket you asked for . ,3
4336," Oh , thank you . ",4
4337, Is there anything I can do for you now ? ,3
4338, Yes . I'm rather tired and want to go to bed early . Please make the bed . ,3
4339," Certainly , sir . ",4
4340,Lin's office supplies . How may I direct your call ? ,2
4341, Marry Lin please . ,1
4342," Sure , just a moment . ... I'm sorry no one answer the phone . ",1
4343," All right , could I leave a message ? ",3
4344, Certainly ! ,4
4345, Please ask her to call John . ,3
4346,Excuse me . Where is the way out ? ,2
4347," Well , that's what I'm looking for myself . ",1
4348," It's very confusing in here , isn't it ? ",2
4349," Absolutely . Oh , do you see a sign there ? ",2
4350, It should be the way out . ,1
4351, OK . Let's go and see . ,3
4352,"Excuse me , I ordered the well-done steak , but this one is so tough . ",1
4353," Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now . ",1
4354, I think you should be more careful next time . ,3
4355," Yes , sir . I'm really so sorry about that . ",4
4356,"Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project . ",1
4357," Look , Sally . I ’ Ve put just as much work into this as anybody else . ",1
4358," No , I ’ m sorry . I disagree . I don ’ t think you ’ Ve been working at full speed at all . ",1
4359, Well . I ’ m sorry you feel that way . ,1
4360,"Hi Joe , how are you doing today ? ",2

4362," Things are going well for me , Joe . ",1
4363, Want to go see a movie tonight ? ,3
4364, My parents are taking me to dinner tonight . ,4
4365," Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ? ",3
4366, What movie did you want to see ? ,2
4367, There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer . ,1
4368, I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ” ,3
4369, Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to ! ,4
4370,How's the bride-to-be ? ,2
4371, Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache . ,1
4372," Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine ! ",1
4373, I'm worried that everything will be chaotic ! ,1
4374, Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests . ,1
4375," You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ... ",3
4376, I will . Don't worry ! ,4
4377,Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ? ,2
4378," Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk . ",1
4379, Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk . ,1
4380," I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator . ",1
4381, Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ? ,2
4382, Nothing . ,1
4383, What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see . ,2
4384, Promise that you won't get angry . ,3
4385," OK , I promise . What is it ? ",2
4386, It's a kitty . ,1
4387," Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house . ",1
4388," Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble . ",3
4389, No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here . ,4
4390," Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame . ",3
4391, All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up . ,4
4392," I will . Thank you , Mummy . ",1
4393,I was wondering if you could help me with something . ,3
4394," Sure , anything you say . ",4
4395," Actually , it ’ s a little bit silly . ",1
4396," Don ’ t worry about it , just ask . ",3
4397, What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ? ,2
4398, You need to know the type of shoes you want . ,1
4399, Don ’ t worry about that . I can point it out in the store . ,3
4400," The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low . ",4
4401, Let me write all that down . I ’ m going shopping this afternoon . ,1
4402,Excuse me . How long has it been since the business was founded ? ,2
4403, It has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998 . ,1
4404," So , it has a history for more than a decade ? ",2
4405, Yes . And it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis . ,1
4406,"What can I do for you , Madam ? ",2
4407, Can you help me with Comprehensive Credit Granting ? ,3
4408," Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ? ",2
4409," Well , everything really . ",3
4410," All right . We can grant a Financing Promise Quota , if you qualify . This means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way . Firstly , your Credit Rating must be class A , and your Debt to Asset Ratio must be top notch , for the industry you are involved in . ",1
4411,Let's do something outdoors today . ,3
4412, All right . But I don't want to play tennis . We played tennis last weekend . ,4
4413, Okay . what do you want to do ? ,2
4414, I want to go jogging . ,1
4415, All right . That sounds like fun . ,1
4416,Good afternoon . I come here specially to pick up my tickets . I booked it last month.This is my reservation note . ,3
4417," I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently.You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled . ",4
4418," But I have been so busy all these days.Well , is there any other ticket available ? I want the next one . ",2
4419,The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest . ,1
4420, Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West . ,2
4421," No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . ",1
4422," You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ? ",2
4423," Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . ",1
4424, Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? ,2
4425," Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . ",1
4426, Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? ,2
4427," Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate . ",1
4428,Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? ,3
4429," We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . ",2
4430," You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . ",3
4431," OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ? ",2
4432," I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time . ",3
4433," OK , will do . ",4
4434,"I want a pair of sports shoes , Adidas . ",3
4435, What size do you want ? ,2
4436, I wear size 40 . ,1
4437, How about this one ? It's the latest design . ,3
4438," Oh , I like the color . ",4
4439,May I help you ? ,2
4440, I'm looking for a pair of shoes . ,1
4441, What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale . ,2
4442, I wear size 36.This pair looks nice.Can I try them on ? ,3
4443," Of course , yes.They look nice.And they're not expensive . ",4
4444, How much are they ? ,2
4445, They are $ 168 . ,1
4446, I'll take them . ,1
4447,A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ? ,2
4448, I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? ,2
4449," Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . ",1
4450," Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . ",1
4451," Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . ",1
4452," Ok , then we can sign up for it together . ",3
4453,Who's it knocking at the door ? ,2
4454, I think it's the postman.Will you go and open the door ? ,3
4455, All right . I'll get it . ,4
4456,Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ? ,2
4457," No , we don't . ",1
4458," How many of you , please ? ",2
4459," Six , including two kids . ",1
4460, I'm afraid all the big tables are taken . ,1
4461,"Hi , I think I was supposed to call for my test results today . ",3
4462," If you go onto our website and put in your password , you can access your test results . ",3
4463, Are you saying that there weren ’ t any problems ? ,2
4464, I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem . ,3
4465, Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them ? ,2
4466," Yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about . ",1
4467, How will I know what the numbers mean ? ,2
4468, You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range . ,3
4469, How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ? ,2
4470, We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need . ,3
4471,"This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee . ",1
4472, If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . ,3
4473, What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . ,1
4474, I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ? ,3
4475, What's your proposal ? ,2
4476," Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway . ",3
4477, Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible ! ,4
4478, What would you suggest ? ,2
4479, The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go . ,3
4480, That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with . ,3
4481, OK . We can meet halfway again . ,4
4482,Hello . ,1
4483," Good morning , Ruth . Did I wake you up ? ",2
4484," No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ? ",2
4485," Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ? ",2
4486, B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown . ,1
4487," Oh , you mean Canal Street ? ",2
4488, That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown . ,1
4489," Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ? ",2
4490," At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ? ",2
4491, I cannot get hold of her yet . ,1
4492," See you around , Carl . ",1
4493, See you later . ,1
4494,Has your company been affected much by government legislation ? ,2
4495," Yes , we have . We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards . ",1
4496, What about your use of raw materials ? ,2
4497," Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ’ re not allowed to use lead in our products any more . ",1
4498, What happens if you exceed the limits ? ,2
4499, We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine . ,1
4500,Have you got any better ? ,2
4501, That's the best there is . ,1
4502," Okay , I'll take one . ",1
4503," That'll be $ 200 , sir . ",1
4504,"Good morning , sir . Sorry to disturb you . May I make up the room now ? ",3
4505," Yes , please . We're on our way out , so we put the ' make up ' sign on . Could you bring us some towels and hangers ? ",3
4506," No problem , sir . Everything will be ready when you come back . ",4
4507,What are the factors that have great impact on the perspective of this corporation ? ,2
4508," External factors . I think the main external factors are political , economic , social and technological factors . ",1
4509, What are the internal factors that influence the company ? ,2
4510," The internal factors are composed of human resources , team spirit , innovation spirit and coordination between different departments , etc . ",1
4511,"I don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday . ",1
4512, What words ? Can you tell me ? ,3
4513," He says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy , very quickly if I do something that he doesn ’ t like . You know , if I wash his face or change his clothes , things like that . ",4
4514," Honey , I don ’ t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason . ",3
4515," Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable . ",4
4516," I suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness . ",3
4517," It ’ s easy to say , but I will try . ",4
4518," Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire . ",3
4519," I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ’ t work , instead he picks up another bad habit . ",4
4520,How can I help you ? ,3
4521," Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates . I would like to see Mr . Smith . ",3
4522, Do you have an appointment ? ,2
4523," Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock . ",1
4524, I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ? ,3
4525, Sure . ,4
4526," Yes , Mr . Mason , I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry , she said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She could be with your shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ? ",3
4527, That would be very nice . Thank you . ,4
4528," Right this way , Mr . Mason . We can start with our front office . When Ms . Terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor . There is a conference room already prepared ",3
4529,did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ? ,2
4530," no , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend . ",1
4531," yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go . ",1
4532, they must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood . ,1
4533, they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want . ,1
4534, I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars . ,1
4535, did either one of them win an Oscar this year ? ,2
4536," I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything . ",1
4537," Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ? ",2
4538," yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous . ",1
4539, I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . ,1
4540, people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated . ,1
4541, I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you . ,1
4542, that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go . ,1
4543, thank goodness we're not rich and famous ! ,1
4544," being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich . ",1
4545,"Next , please . ",3
4546, Could I purchase Euro with RIB here ? I have to stay here for months . ,3
4547," Yes , the rate for cash purchases is listed on the electronica screen , so you have seen the rate of exchange . ",4
4548," Yes , I have known of it . ",1
4549, How much do you like to exchange ? ,2
4550," 20,000 RIB . ",3
4551, In what denominations ? ,2
4552," It doesn't matter , but leave me some small changes , that will be convenient in daily life . ",3
4553," Right , I will exchange for you now . Please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone . ",3
4554," Well , could you change them too ? The dollars , I want to change them into Swiss francs . ",3
4555," OK , wait for a moment . Well , I am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . In this case , you'd better change 2,000 $ to Swiss francs . ",3
4556, It doesn't matter . ,4
4557, Please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo . ,3
4558, Thanks a lot . Good-bye . ,4

4562, That would be nice . How are you getting there ? ,2
4563," Well , I prefer to go on the train , but I suppose you want me to take the car . ",3
4564," Oh , I much prefer to go by car , then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and ... ",3
4565, And I've got to drive . You know I'm not fond of that . I found it much more relaxing to sit in the train . ,4
4566, Which is more expensive ? ,2
4567, But very much quicker . But I know we'll never agree on this subject . You prefer the car . I prefer the train . ,1
4568," Now , have you ever thought of going by express bus ? ",3
4569,I want to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front . ,3
4570, What a wonderful neighborhood ! Can you find that house on our Open House list ? ,2
4571," Yes , that is one of the houses that we have on our list . ",1
4572, They always make the front yards look so great for Open Houses . Let ’ s see what the inside looks like . ,3
4573, I am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here . ,4
4574, Signing the registry is a good idea . I think I want to see the kitchen next . ,1
4575, I really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day . ,1
4576, I need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it . ,1
4577, Is the current asking price listed on the flyer ? ,2
4578, The asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars . ,1
4579,"Hello . This is Mrs . Wilson . I'd like to buy a new car . Could you offer me a new type of the car , please ? ",3

4581," A new car . And I've got a small family , two children , and I haven't got a lot of money and ... ",1
4582," Oh , oh , Madam , Madam , I'm afraid you have the wrong number . ",1
4583, Isn't this the car store ? ,2

4586, No . I don't . I suggest you look in the phone book . ,1
4587, I'm sorry to have bothered you . ,1

4590, That's great . What's on tonight ? ,2
4591," I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one . ",1
4592, Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better . ,1
4593, Don't you think it's too bloody ? ,2
4594," On the contrary , very exciting . ",1
4595,"Hello , I scheduled an appointment with Dr . Smith , and I can ’ t make it on that day . ",1

4660, I saw her yesterday.She was a little better . ,1
4661, Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ? ,2

4663," Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ? ",2
4664," Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus . ",1
4665," Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 . ",1

4707," First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations . ",1
4708, That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff . ,3
4709," I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of ",3
4710," Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD . ",4
4711, Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ? ,3
4712, The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ? ,2
4713, Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month . ,1
4714, When will the branch office open ? ,2
4715, Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly . ,1

4725,did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ? ,2
4726, why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that . ,1
4727," well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers . ",1
4728, do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ? ,2
4729," no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions . ",1
4730, it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America . ,1
4731," religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal . ",1
4732, what do you think about abortion ? ,2
4733," I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself . ",1
4734, do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ? ,2
4735," I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children . ",1
4736," why not ? It's their children , too . ",2
4737," that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand . ",1
4738," that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter . ",1
4739,"Come to think of it , you should get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments . ",3
4740, But I don't have any reading assignments . ,4

4749,How did you find your apartment ? ,2
4750, You can check on the bulletin boards at school for local housing . ,1
4751, What if I need a roommate ? ,2
4752, There are websites that can hook you up with a roommate . ,1
4753, How much do apartments cost around here ? ,2
4754, It depends on what you want . Do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment ? ,2
4755, I just need a one-bedroom apartment . ,1
4756, That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month . ,1
4757, Would you come with me to look at apartments ? ,3
4758, I would be happy to look at apartments with you . ,4

4767, Will you go and visit them ? ,2
4768, Of course I will . ,1
4769, I just wanted to give you the good news . ,1
4770, Thanks for letting me know . ,1
4771,How silly of you to jump out of the window ! ,1
4772, But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake ! ,1
4773, Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time . ,2
4774, That would be too late . ,1
4775, Maybe the situation is too urgent . ,1
4776," Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case . ",1
4777,I need to stop eating such unhealthy foods . ,1
4778, I know what you mean . I've started eating better myself . ,1
4779, What foods do you eat now ? ,2
4780," I tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken . ",1
4781, Those are the only things you eat ? ,2
4782, That's basically what I eat . ,1
4783, Why aren't you eating anything else ? ,2
4784," Well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy . ",1

4796,Do you have experience in advertising ? ,2
4797," Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company . ",1
4798, What were you mean duties there ? ,2
4799, I mostly did advertising planning . ,1
4800, What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ? ,2
4801," I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market . ",1
4802, What was the most important thing you have learned at work ? ,2
4803," The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . If I want to make in marking in advertising industry , I can ’ t stop studying and creating . ",1
4804,The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here ! ,3
4805, Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up . ,4
4806, That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! ,1
4807, Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . ,1
4808, I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . ,1

4821," Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ? ",2
4822," Yeah , a number of times . ",1
4823, What's he trying to pull anyway . ,1
4824, I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw . ,1
4825, Maybe you should start seeing someone else . ,3
4826," You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy . ",4
4827,I can't believe how hot it is . ,1

4960," Well , I don't want it then . Can I move to another pump ? ",3
4961," Yes , I can give you regular unleaded . But you have to back up the car a little . ",4
4962, Give me regular unleaded then . I will back up.Can you wash my windows for me ? ,3
4963," I'm sorry , sir . This is not a full service gas station . I will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here . ",4

4982,I went to the tutoring service centre on campus today . And I got a job . ,1
4983, Congratulation . What will you do ? ,2

4985, That's wonderful . I want to get a part-time job too . Tell me what I should do . ,3

4987, Good . I'll do it . ,4
4988,Has Robert ever missed coming to one of our parties ? ,2

4994, Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing . ,1
4995," You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning . ",1
4996, No wonder people say ,1
4997," Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky ! ",1
4998, I didn't know you liked bird-watching . ,1
4999," I don't really . I just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . This place is full of it . ",1
5000,"Hide me , Yi-jun ! The kids all think I'm the real Easter bunny ! ",1
5001," Aw , that's sweet ! I knew your costume would be a success . ",1

5003," Yeah , I saw that . I thought you were playing a game with them . ",1
5004, Some game ! You try being tackled by ten kids at once ! ,1
5005," Um , Holly ? Look behind you . They're coming this way . ",1
5006,"hi , Bob , I am so glad that you came . ",1
5007, of course I'd come . I couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends . ,1

5009," how time flies . But hey , how are things going with you ? ",2
5010," oh , where to start ? There have been ups and downs . I'm still trying to find my place in this world . It's only recently that I've been able to start settling down . How about you ? You still with Jenn ",2
5011," yeah , Jenny and I got married right after graduation . It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . I was supporting us both while she continued her studies . But now things are getting better ",1

5013," definitely ! Actually , we just moved into a new place . There's a house-warming party this Saturday , if you are free ? I know Jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party . ",3
5014, sounds great ! I'll be there . ,4
5015,"I guess I'm just a little nervous . I'm giving everything I have to invoking , and ... ",1
5016," and what if it doesn't work out , right ? ",2
5017, Exactly . ,1
5018, You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . You know how I know ? ,2
5019, How ? ,2
5020, Because I won't let it fail . ,1
5021," But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars.com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ? ",2
5022,Are you ready for the camping trip ? ,2
5023," All set . I've got my makeup , my Cds , and my portable TV set ... ",1
5024, Hello ! We're supposed to be getting back to nature . ,1

5029, Same difference . What's this ? ,2
5030,It's getting late . I really have to go . ,1
5031, I hope we'll get together again soon . ,3
5032, I hope so . A good journey to you ! ,4
5033, Thank you . ,1
5034,I ’ m fed up with marriage . ,1
5035, Why do you say so ? Everyone admires that you have a good wife . ,2
5036," Oh , no . When we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . It was a hard time . ",1
5037, But now you are rich . ,1
5038, And we have some squabbles on some boring things . ,1
5039, This is ordinary marriage life . ,1
5040,How about you and Tom ? What time is your wedding ? ,2
5041," Don ’ t be kidding , OK ? ",1
5042, What ’ s the matter ? So angry . I ’ m just playing a joke with you . ,2
5043, Because I have given him up as a bad job . Our relation has been over . ,1
5044,"Margaret , do you think I should enroll in the science course ? ",2
5045," Yes , I think so , If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course . ",3
5046," Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses . ",1
5047," Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics.what you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors . ",1
5048," Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school . ",1
5049, That's a problem . ,1
5050,What are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ? ,2
5051, It's Beethoven . Do you like it ? ,2
5052," I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . Do you believe that ? ",2
5053," I don't know about that , but I do think that it helps people relax . ",1
5054, What other kind of music do you listen to ? ,2
5055," Actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ? ",2
5056," To be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me . ",1
5057, What kind of music do you prefer then ? ,2
5058, I like pop music . Do you ? ,2
5059, Not really . I don't think pop music has much depth . ,1
5060, I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much . ,1
5061," How long have you been in to pop music , then ? ",2
5062, I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ? ,2
5063," Not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all . ",1
5064," So , how did you become interested in it ? ",2
5065," Well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started . ",1
5066, Do you still play piano ? ,2
5067," Yes , it's one of my hobbies . ",1
5068,"Hi Paul . How are you , friend . ",2
5069, Not good . My cousin is driving me up the wall . ,1
5070, How so ? ,2
5071," He stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help . ",1
5072, Have you talk to him about it ? ,2
5073," Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night ",1
5074," Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight . ",1
5075," This is no laughing matter , Nick . ",1
5076, Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ? ,2
5077, He watch the tob too much . Now really I don't know . But I can't handle this much longer . ,1
5078," Well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , OK ? ",3
5079,"You're from New York , aren't you ? ",2
5080," Yes , that's right . ",1
5081, What do you suggest I should see in New York ? ,2
5082," Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ? ",3
5083," No , I don't like museums . They're boring . ",4
5084, Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ? ,3
5085, Ah ! That sounds interesting . ,4
5086,What's your favorite book ? ,2
5087, It's Gone With the Wind . ,1
5088, Why do you like it best ? ,2
5089, I enjoy the various characters and the plot . ,1
5090, Well . I like the Thom Birds best . ,1
5091, Is it very interesting ? ,2
5092," Sure . I like the writer's language , too . ",1
5093," If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book . ",1
5094, Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ? ,3
5095, That's a good idea . Let's go ! ,4
5096,"John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? ",2
5097," Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ? ",2
5098," It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day . ",1
5099," You forgot all of about it , didn't you ? ",2
5100,I ’ m pretty sure that Jim will turn out to be a good lawyer . ,1
5101, How can you be so sure ? ,2
5102," He knows a lot about law and he ’ s eloquent , too . ",1
5103,Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr . Miller ? ,3
5104, Yes . Are you going to be taking a class from him ? ,2
5105," Yes , but I have never taken his class before . ",1
5106, He is very interesting and challenging . Is that what you are looking for ? ,2
5107," Yes , that's what I need . ",1
5108, He is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade . Are you willing to study hard ? ,2
5109," Yes , I guess so . ",1
5110, What I really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . Do you enjoy that in a teacher ? ,2
5111," Yes , I had a teacher like that before . ",1
5112, Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience ? ,2
5113," No , I didn't , but that could be a good thing . ",1
5114," Well , take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you . Good luck ! ",3
5115,"Honey , what's wrong with you ? ",2
5116, I'm not feeling well . I'm very nervous . ,1
5117, Take it easy . We are going to have our own baby . You should be happy . ,1
5118," Yeah , I know . ",1
5119," The doctors and the nurses will help you . And I will be waiting for you right here , praying for you and our baby . ",1
5120," Thank you , dear . I feel better now . ",1
5121,The weather is terrible . ,1
5122, Yeah . It's been raining a lot these days . ,1
5123, I have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain . ,1
5124, Have you heard when it's supposed to get better ? ,2
5125," I saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days . ",1
5126, That sucks so much . What are we going to do ? ,2
5127, I'm getting pretty bored . We should do something despite the rain . ,1
5128, I'm with you . What do you have in mind ? ,2
5129, I haven't been to the Mall in a long time . Let's go there . ,1
5130," That sounds good . They have a movie theatre there , so if we get bored , we can watch a movie . ",3
5131, Great . I'll stop by your place now . ,4
5132, Ok . Don't forget to bring your umbrella . The rain can start up again anytime . ,2
5133,"Come in , come in , what can I do for you ? ",2
5134," Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? ",2
5135," Yes , I am applying on it . ",1
5136," I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ... ",3
5137, Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up . ,4
5138," I know , but geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field . ",3
5139," Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll . ",4
5140," Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you . ",1
5141,"... so , I said , let ’ s take a break.And since that night , I ’ Ve been waiting for him to call , but I still haven ’ t heard from him . You don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else , do you ? ",2
5142," Come on , don ’ t be so dramatic ! I ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine . ",1
5143," You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ? ",2
5144," But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes . ",1
5145, He ’ s the love of my life ! I ’ Ve really messed this up . ,1
5146," Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ’ s going to be alright . ",3
5147," But I ... I still love him ! And it ’ s all my fault ! I can ’ t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ’ Ve totally messed this up ! ",1
5148," You know what , Veronica , I think you should make the first step . I ’ m sure he ’ ll forgive you ... ",3
5149," No , this is not gonna happen ! I ... I ’ Ve ruined everything ... ",4
5150, do you hear something ? ,2
5151,"what's wrong , Jerry ? You look so upset . ",2
5152," to be honest , I was just dumped . ",1
5153," oh , I'm sorry to hear that . You can go on a holiday to cheer you up . ",3
5154," no , thanks . I'm not in the mood for traveling . ",4
5155, come on . A trip will do you good . Are you doing anything this weekend ? ,2
5156, I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing . ,1
5157," well , my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday . Do you want to come with us ? ",3
5158, where is that ? ,2
5159, not very far from here . We'll fly . It's about one and a half hours . ,1
5160, what's there to see ? ,2
5161," there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes . ",1
5162," oh , sounds nice . ",1
5163," yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . I have some pictures at home . You can come over and take a look if you like . ",3
5164, ok . Then I can make up my mind . ,4
5165,Did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies ? ,2
5166," Yes , just once . ",1
5167, What was the reason ? ,2
5168, I once played truant when I was in college because I intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster-hit areas in Sichuan . ,1
5169,Do you want to hang out tomorrow ? ,3
5170," Oh , I can't . I have a date ! ",4
5171, Really ? Wow with who ? ,2
5172, This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend . ,1
5173," Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ? ",2
5174," Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat . ",1
5175, That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ? ,2
5176," It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy . ",1
5177, I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out ! ,1
5178,"Well , I'm afraid I must be going now . I have no idea it was so late . ",1
5179, Stay for dinner with us . ,3
5180," I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight . You see , I am going to England the day after tomorrow . ",4
5181," Well , I won't keep you then . It was very nice of you to come to see me . ",1
5182, It has been a pleasure . Goodbye . ,1
5183, Goodbye . Thank you again for coming . ,1
5184,"Honey , do you have a second ? ",2
5185, Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried.What ’ s on your mind ? ,2
5186, We need to talk . ,3
5187, Okay ... ,4
5188," I ’ Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people . ",3
5189," What ? Why ? I mean , we ’ Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ? ",2
5190," That ’ s just it , I ’ m not happy anymore , Tim . It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for ! ",1
5191," So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ? ",2
5192," Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry . ",1
5193," Baby , come on . Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me . ",3
5194," I can ’ t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ’ m only doing this for you . I don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do . ",4
5195, Laura ... ,1
5196," Here are your keys . I ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ’ m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ’ ll always love you . Goodbye . ",1
5197,"Oh , my God . I can't take it any more . ",1
5198," What's wrong , honey ? Take it easy . ",2
5199, I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible . ,1
5200, Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change . ,1
5201, You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ? ,1
5202, But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company . ,1
5203," Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help . ",1
5204, Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation . ,3
5205, I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career . ,1
5206, Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting . ,3
5207, That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that . ,1
5208, How about a training course ? ,3
5209, A training course ? That must be costly . ,4
5210, But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future . ,1
5211," OK , let's have a try . ",4
5212, OK . ,1
5213,Have you seen the new James Bond movie ? ,2
5214," Oh , yes . You ? ",2
5215, Yes . What did you think of it ? ,2
5216, I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it . What did you think of it ? ,2
5217," Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ? ",2
5218," Mmm . That's what I thought too . I really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan . ",1
5219," Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ? ",2
5220," Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ? ",2
5221," Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ? ",2
5222," Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ? ",2
5223, I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond ! ,1
5224, Yes ! ,1
5225,My friend Jean is very beautiful . ,1
5226, What's her figure ? ,2
5227," Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too . ",1
5228, What's the color of her eyes ? ,2
5229, Dark blue . ,1
5230,Where are you going ? ,2
5231, I'm going to buy a CD . ,1
5232, Why not listen to music online ? ,2
5233," Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , isn't it ? ",2
5234," You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it . ",1
5235," I have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened . ",1
5236," In order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software . ",1
5237, Can you recommend some to me ? ,2
5238, Certainly . Realplayer is a good . ,3
5239, Can I download it ? ,2
5240," Yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it . ",1
5241, I'll try it tonight . ,4
5242,What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense . ,2
5243," Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate . ",1
5244," Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ? ",2
5245, He asked me how long it took me to learn English . ,1
5246," But , you were born and raised in California ! ",1
5247," Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes . ",1
5248, What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ? ,2
5249," You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice . ",1
5250," So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ? ",2
5251," I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it . ",1
5252, Are you sure he really got the message ? ,2
5253," Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English . ",1
5254, That's hilarious ! What did he say ? ,2

5312,"Boy , it looks like everyone in your family is here , from young to old . ",1

5357, The fee is 25 cents every day . ,1
5358, I have to pay 25 cents a day ? ,2

5361,This is such a beautiful day ! Great for sailing ! ,1
5362, It sure is ! The water looks so nice ! Anchor the boat for a little while . I ’ m going to take a dip . ,1
5363, Why are you doggy-paddling ? I taught you how to swim ! Do your breast stroke ! ,2
5364," I get too tired ! I ’ ll just backstroke , it ’ s easier ! ",1

5376, did your husband's family get to meet your family ? ,2
5377," my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t ",1
5378, that makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ? ,2
5379, we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa . ,1
5380," you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? ",2
5381," not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! ",1

5418,Do you watch a lot of TV ? ,2
5419, Not really . I could take it or leave it . ,1
5420, Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on . ,1

5429," I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here . ",1
5430," I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea . ",1
5431, Why were you in Japan ? ,2
5432, My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures . ,1
5433, That's pretty cool . ,1
5434, I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents . ,1
5435," Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around . ",3
5436," Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class . ",4

5438,Guess who I saw just now ? ,2
5439, Who ? ,2
5440," John Smith , the escaped criminal . ",1
5441," That bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy . ",1
5442, I think I must report to the cops . ,1
5443, Ok . ,1
5444,What do you think of this one ? ,2
5445," Eh , so so . ",1
5446, And this one ? Too flashy ? ,2
5447," Nah , not too flashy . ",1
5448, Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ? ,2
5449, I guess . ,1
5450, Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you . ,2
5451," And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes ! ",1
5452, Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon ! ,1
5453, Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! ,1
5454," Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! ",1
5455," Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? ",2
5456, I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! ,1
5457,Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ’ s OK . ,1
5458," Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ’ t go into detail , but it wasn ’ t serious . ",1
5459, I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital . ,1
5460," I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation . ",1
5461, It must have really hurt afterwards . ,1
5462," Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing . ",1
5463, I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital . ,1
5464," I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ’ t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list ! ",1
5465, Is there any pain now ? ,2
5466," No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days . ",1
5467, Did they take good care of you in the hospital ? ,2
5468," Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay . ",1
5469,How was the party ? ,2
5470, I had a fantastic time . ,1
5471,"Hi , Monica , how is everything going ? ",2
5472," Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job . ",1
5473, Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ? ,2
5474," I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out . ",1
5475, That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application . ,1
5476," Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later . ",1
5477," Ok , good luck to you . ",1
5478,"Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ? ",2
5479, Yeah . But he soon feel regretted for it . ,1
5480, But he seems to be very happy with Rose . ,1

5491,The weather has been terrible this week . ,1
5492," Yeah , I'm worried . If it's like this tomorrow , our big outdoor party will have to be canceled . ",1
5493, Let's hope it clears up . ,1
5494,Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ? ,2
5495," Yeah , I'm afraid so . ",1
5496," If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude . ",1
5497," Yes , it is annoying . ",1
5498,"Hi , Mr . Smith . what's new ? ",2
5499," Nothing particular . But , ... ",1
5500, What's the matter ? ,2
5501," I , I don't know how to explain it to you . ",1

5512, That's all right . ,1
5513,"Hey , what's new ? ",2
5514, Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ? ,2
5515," Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me . ",1
5516, What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ? ,2
5517," Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful . ",1
5518," That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day . ",2
5519, But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope . ,1
5520,"Lily , can you take part in our picnic this weekend ? ",3

5528, I can tell form the way he spoke to us . ,1
5529, Never believe his words . ,1
5530,Should we ask Jason to play ? He's always watching movies on HBO . ,3
5531, I guess we should invite him . I just hope he doesn't start talking about Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger again . ,4
5532," Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad . ",1
5533," Yeah , you're right . We'll never hear the end of it . ",1
5534,What do you think about violence in movies ? ,2
5535," Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch . ",1
5536," But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ? ",2
5537," If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun . ",1
5538,Are you free tomorrow night ? ,2
5539," Yes , I am . ",1
5540, Shall we have dinner together ? ,3
5541, Do you have a special restaurant in mind ? ,2

5545, The board has been considering introducing flex time . ,1
5546," Good news . Ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided . ",1

5550, Where did you learn ? ,2
5551, I learned in college . ,1

5560, Have you ever been to Las Vegas ? ,2
5561, Yes . I went there once on a business trip . ,1
5562,How are the children doing at sport ? ,2
5563, I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age . ,1
5564," He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? ",2
5565," He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone his age . ",1
5566, Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? ,2
5567, The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . ,1
5568, How are they at swimming ? ,2
5569," They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . ",1
5570, Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . ,1
5571, I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height ! ,1
5572," I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . ",1
5573," It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further . ",1
5574,"Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ? ",2
5575," Yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day . ",1
5576, Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time . ,1
5577," Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ... ",1
5578, Is everything ready now ? ,2
5579," Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive . ",1
5580, Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job . ,2
5581," Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet . ",1
5582," It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . ",1
5583, That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception . ,1
5584, I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available . ,3
5585, Thank you . ,4
5586, My pleasure . ,1
5587,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? ,2
5588," Sorry , I thought you knew . ",1
5589, But you should have told me you were in love with her . ,1
5590, Didn't I ? ,2
5591, You know you didn't . ,1
5592," Well , I'm telling you now . ",1
5593," Yes , but you might have told me before . ",1
5594, I didn't think you'd be interested . ,1
5595, You can't be serious.How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? ,2
5596," Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . ",1
5597," Oh , you men ! You're all the same . ",1
5598,"Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? ",2
5599, Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . ,3
5600, What about water pollution instead of pollution ? ,4
5601,How ’ s it going ? ,2
5602, I ’ m fine . Thank you . ,1
5603, Do you need anything ? ,2
5604, I need you to help me . ,3
5605, What can I do for you ? ,2
5606, I am looking for an article in a newspaper . ,3
5607, Did you check the periodicals ? ,3
5608, I didn ’ t even bother to think of that . ,4
5609, I ’ ll show you where to find your article . ,3
5610, I get lost in this library . ,1
5611, It ’ s right this way . ,3
5612, Thanks a lot for your help . ,1
5613,How about eating out for a drink with me tonight . ,3
5614, Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ? ,3
5615," No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ? ",3
5616, All right . See you tomorrow night . ,4
5617,"Hi , Helen ! how is it going ? ",2
5618, I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work . ,1
5619," Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you . ",3
5620, I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now . ,4
5621, Why don't you take a few days off ? ,3
5622, I can't . I am really behind of my work . ,4
5623,Can you speak Japanese ? ,2
5624," Yes , I can , but not very well . ",1
5625, Where did you learn it ? ,2
5626, At school . And I'm still learning it now . ,1
5627, How long have you been learning it ? ,2
5628, About three years . ,1
5629, Can you speak any other languages ? ,2
5630, I'm afraid not . ,1
5631,"Good afternoon , Johnson . ",1
5632," Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ? ",2
5633," Not bad , thanks . ",1
5634,I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime ! ,1
5635, God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ? ,2
5636," Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day . ",1
5637, They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest . ,2
5638, I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project . ,1
5639, You'd better pay more attention to your health . ,3
5640," I will , thanks for your concern . ",4
5641, You're welcome . ,1
5642,It is too bad today . ,1
5643, What happened ? ,2
5644," My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it . ",1
5645, How did you find him at last ? ,2
5646, It was the police wo helped me to do that . ,1
5647, It must have taught you a lesson this time . ,1
5648,I want to give our kitchen the works . ,1
5649, Why ? I think it ’ s convenient and good . ,2
5650, No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ’ s modern . ,1
5651, Why should we run after the fashion ? ,2
5652, I am not running after the fashion . I just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen . ,1
5653,Rock music really leaves me cold . What about you ? ,2
5654, I'm crazy about it.It makes me very excited . ,1
5655, Then tell me what's good about it . ,1
5656, It can't be expressed by words . ,1
5657,What's wrong with Debbie today ? She seems upset about something . ,2
5658, I have no idea . Maybe she had a fight with her husband . ,1
5659,"Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one . ",1
5660," Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal . ",1
5661," Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . ",1
5662," I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . ",1
5663,"Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ? ",2
5664," Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well . ",1
5665, Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion . ,1
5666," That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic . ",1
5667, Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert . ,1
5668," Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner . ",1
5669,Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? ,2
5670, What ? Why do we have to do that ? ,2
5671," Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . ",1
5672," I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! ",1
5673," That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! ",1
5674," That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time ! ",1
5675,I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight . How about you ? ,2
5676," Yes , I ‘ d love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . ",1
5677," I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo . ",1
5678, Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ? ,1
5679," I ‘ m really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders . ",1
5680, You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ? ,2
5681," You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film . ",1
5682, It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress . ,1
5683,How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ? ,2
5684, We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education . ,1
5685, Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job . ,1
5686, But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things . ,1
5687,How do you celebrate national day in your country ? ,2
5688, There are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building . ,1
5689, What kinds of parades are there ? ,2
5690," The parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . What do you do on national day in your country ? ",2
5691, We don ’ t have a national day . ,1
5692, Really ? That ’ s unusual . ,2
5693," I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ’ t . ",1
5694," Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day . ",1
5695,"Hi Melissa , are you going home this weekend ? ",2
5696," No , not this weekend . I have too much work to do . ",1
5697, Where do your parents live ? ,2

5701," Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Is your father still working ? ",2
5702," No , he's retired . ",1
5703, Do you have any family here ? ,2
5704," Yes , two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here . ",1
5705, Do you have any brothers or sisters ? ,2
5706," Yes , I have two brothers who live in New York and a sister who lives in Boston . ",1
5707, Do you see them a lot ? ,2
5708, Not as much as I'd like to . Usually just on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas . ,1
5709,"Hey , how was the show ? ",2
5710, Not great . It's a kind of boring . ,1
5711, Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great . ,2
5712," Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed . ",1
5713,"What happened , John ? ",2
5714, Nothing . ,1
5715, Why do you look unhappy ? ,2
5716, I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off . ,1
5717," Oh , cheer up . He ’ ll understand you . ",1
5718, I hope so . ,1
5719,You know that ? Joan has got the scholarship . ,1
5720, Really ? ,2
5721, But I think Henry is a backroom boy.He always helps her with her study . ,1
5722, You're right . ,1
5723,"Hi , Tina , I ’ Ve got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising . ",1
5724, That is awesome . Congratulation ! I know you can make it . ,1
5725, Thanks . Let ’ s go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ? ,3
5726," Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . See 5PM , ok ? ",3
5727, No problem . See you ! ,4
5728, See you ! ,1
5729,Do you like ethnic food ? ,2
5730," I do ! My favorites are Mexican , Thai , and Indian . ",1
5731, Really ? Have you ever tried Moroccan ? ,2
5732, I can't say that I have . What are the basic ingredients ? ,2
5733, I don't know . A friend of mine said I should try it . ,1
5734, Do you know where a Moroccan restaurant is ? ,2
5735," As a matter of fact , he gave me this address . ",1
5736, Let's go there for lunch ! I'm up for an adventure ! ,1
5737,"Nicole , your Fettucini is very ... unique . ",1
5738," But not as good as your mother's , right ? ",2
5739," Actually , it's better ... ",1
5740, What ? Are you kidding ? ,2
5741, No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ... ,1
5742," Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you ! ",1
5743," OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ... ",1
5744,How many people are there in your family ? ,2
5745," Five.My father , mother , brother , sister-in-law and me . ",1

5747," He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday.My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age . ",1
5748,"Hello , Tom . Where are you heading for ? ",2
5749," I am going to a movie theater . You know there is a new action film produced by Hollywood . A thriller , really . ",1
5750, Another terror film ? There is too much terror and violence in the films . Do you like seeing such a picture ? ,2
5751," I don't really like seeing bloody frames , but I appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects . ",1
5752,Did you go to the concert last weekend ? ,2
5753," No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ? ",2
5754," Yes . I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . ",1
5755, How much was the ticket ? ,2
5756, I only paid two dollars for mine . ,1
5757,Mary and Tom are breaking up . ,1
5758, It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ? ,2
5759," Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman . ",1
5760, Do you think they'll become reconciled ? ,2
5761," No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage . ",1
5762, What a shame ! Their marriage is really a mistake . ,1
5763,have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ? ,2
5764, sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality . ,1
5765," as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ? ",2
5766," to begin with , I have to use chopsticks . ",1
5767, but you look quite proficient in using them now . ,1
5768," certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch ",1
5769," yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm i ",2
5770, anything strang about that ? ,2
5771," maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present . ",1
5772," oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks . ",1
5773,It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck . ,1
5774, Don't be so angry . It's passed anyway . ,1
5775, I can't forget it . ,1
5776, You'd better cool yourself down first . ,1
5777,"Let's program your courses . Since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction.You transcript indicate that your English background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it . ",3

5784, I meet too many jerks . ,1
5785, I agree . ,1
5786, This city is full of jerks . ,1
5787, Rude people are everywhere . ,1
5788, But what can you do ? ,2
5789, You can yell at them . ,1
5790, And they will yell back at you . ,1
5791, Yelling doesn't do any good . ,1
5792, No . The best thing to do is just stay home . ,1

5805,Good morning . ,1
5806, Good morning . ,1
5807, What does the paper say ? ,2

5810," Sunny and mild today , cloudy and rainy tomorrow . ",1
5811, Did they find those bank robbers ? ,2

5823,I hate computer games . ,1
5824, Why ? They are fine . ,2

5841, And the tango ? ,2
5842," Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't do it well . ",1
5843, Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can do it very well . Then I'll meet you at six . Is that at all right ? ,3

5867, I live in my uncle's house . He came here ten years ago . ,1
5868, What do you think of the local accent here ? Has it been causing you any problems ? ,2
5869, I think it's just a matter of getting used to it . ,1
5870, I can't agree more . ,1
5871,Why don't you watch where you're going ? ,2
5872, Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me ! ,2
5873, There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in . ,1
5874," Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me . ",1
5875, I think my arm is broken . ,1
5876," Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too . ",1
5877," Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was . ",3
5878, Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried . ,4
5879," I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ? ",3
5880, Alright . ,4
5881, It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . ,3
5882," Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital . ",4
5883, Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . ,1
5884," Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time . ",1
5885, It really hurts . ,1
5886," Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ? ",2
5887, To hell with you . The accident was your fault . ,1
5888," I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ? ",2
5889, To hell with you . ,1
5890,"Bill , do you know if the cafeteria around the corner's open today ? ",2
5891, Yes . They were open this morning when I came to work . They must've finished remodeling . Why do you want to know ? ,2
5892," Well , I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . That is , if you haven't promised to go with someone else . ",1
5893," That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning . ",1
5894, I'm sorry I was such a grouch . It must've been the weather . When it rains I get depressed . ,1
5895, Forget it . I'll see you at 11:30 am . ,1
5896,The stepmother was very wicked . She couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face . ,1

5914, She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around . ,1
5915, For example ? ,2
5916," Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . ",1
5917," No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . ",1
5918, It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . ,1
5919," My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . ",1

5959," Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . ",1
5960," He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him . ",1

5962," Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out . ",1

5969, I thought we were supposed to meet here . ,1
5970, Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . ,2

5973, You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie . ,3

6051," I'm afraid not . But at tomorrow's funeral , the family requested an open casket service . ",4
6052," This is all too fast . He's my best friend , and now he's gone . ",1
6053, I'm sorry . I know it must have come as a great shock . ,1
6054," The viewing was for saying goodbye , and I didn't even get that . ",1

6056, He must be green . It ’ s lucky that we will get off soon . ,1
6057,I prefer potatoes to eggplants . ,1

6061,That way they look longer . ,1
6062, Now what are you doing ? ,2
6063, Putting on mascara . ,1
6064, Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes . ,3

6077, Do you have any where in mind ? ,2
6078," Yes , I've been thinking about Florida . ",1
6079,"Like a cat on hot bricks , as you might say . I don ’ t believe you are listening at all . ",1
6080," Sorry , I just worried about him . You know , he should be here an hour ago . ",1
6081," Don ’ t worry him , he has been grown up and I think he can take himself very well . ",1
6082, But he still does not come back . ,1
6083, Maybe he is on the way home now . ,1
6084,How long have you been in England ? ,2
6085, For almost two years . ,1
6086, Almost two years ? Your English is very good . ,2

6098, His grandfather's money is not his . ,1
6099, I can't understand him anyway . ,1
6100,What did he say ? ,2
6101, He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man . ,1
6102," It ’ s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man . ",1
6103," Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know . ",1
6104,"I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat.oh , there he is . ",1

6158, Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ? ,2
6159," Sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . ",1
6160, You were lucky then . What did you do after that ? ,2
6161, We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan . ,1

6174," You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ... ",3
6175, I'll take home economics . ,3

6177,"Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of your computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts . ",1
6178, But I ... I don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills . ,1
6179, What do you mean ? ,2
6180," They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that's because they rely on gadgets . ",1
6181, That's not the gadgets . Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . It engages their imagination and sharpen their mind . ,1

6196, How about your husband . Does he help much ? ,2
6197, Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ? ,1
6198, That sucks . ,1
6199," If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ? ",2

6206, Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? ,2

6214, I want to travel . ,1
6215, Where would you like to go ? ,2
6216, The seaside . ,1
6217, That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian . ,1

6228,"Very glad to know something about you , then what are you going to do when you finish . ",1
6229," Oh , I ’ ll go to shanghai to practice there . ",1
6230, That ’ s a good idea . It must be easy to find a job in shanghai . ,1
6231," I think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there . ",1
6232, And English is very useful in your job . ,1
6233," I think it will be very useful in many ways . Beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in China , but also in the world , English is useful in almost all walks of life . ",1
6234, You will be a very promising one . ,1
6235, That ’ s my wish . ,1
6236,I hear you are expecting your family . ,1
6237," Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well . ",1
6238, I didn't know you had a brother . ,2
6239," Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often . ",1
6240," Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ? ",2
6241, His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here . ,1
6242, Does your brother have just one son ? ,2
6243," No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them . ",1
6244, I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson . ,1
6245," Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it . ",1
6246, So when are they all coming ? ,2
6247, My parents are already here . My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday . ,1
6248,You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ? ,2
6249, I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday . ,1
6250, Where did you spend your holiday ? ,2
6251, I went to Paris . ,1
6252,"So , Paula , where are you from ? ",2
6253," I'm from Canada , originally . ",1
6254, From Canada ? Where were you born ? ,2
6255, Montreal . ,1
6256, When did you come to Los Angeles ? ,2
6257, We moved here when I was fourteen . ,1
6258, Did you go to school here ? ,2
6259," Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas . ",1
6260, Did you get a job right after graduation ? ,2
6261," No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France . ",1
6262, When was that ? ,2
6263, Let's see ... That was about six years ago . ,1
6264, I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ? ,2
6265, I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me.How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ? ,2
6266,Do you consider yourself a good mother ? ,2
6267," Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman . ",1
6268," How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother . ",2
6269," I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself . ",1
6270, Does your husband feel the same ? ,2
6271, Yes . He is very understanding and supportive . ,1
6272,"I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth . ",1
6273," let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance . ",3
6274," I often do , but I ’ m worried about the responses from other people . ",4
6275," you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion . ",3
6276, I ’ m worried that what I say will not make sense . ,4
6277, we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking . ,3
6278, that ’ s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ? ,2
6279, that ’ s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle . ,3
6280, I didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy . ,4
6281," the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ’ t be sure how . ",1
6282,What's his job ? ,2
6283, He used to be a policeman . ,1
6284, But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son . ,1
6285, Yeah . He's a private eye now . ,1
6286,Bother the flies ! ,1
6287, Where do they come from ? ,2
6288, I don't know . Something rotten here ? ,2
6289, I can't see it . ,1
6290,Have you got your invitation yet ? ,2
6291," My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ? ",2
6292, The house warming party . ,1
6293, Whose house warming party is it ? ,2
6294, Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house . ,2
6295," Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately . ",2
6296, It's out in the suburbs . ,1
6297, Have you seen the house ? ,2
6298," Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend . ",1
6299, Is it nice ? ,2
6300," Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . ",1
6301, There's also a garden . ,1
6302," Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ? ",2
6303," They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight . ",1
6304, When are they going to have the party ? ,2
6305, Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow . ,1
6306," Wow , that would be something to look forward to . ",1
6307,"hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ? ",3
6308, I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . ,1
6309," oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ? ",2
6310," we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec ",3
6311, wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait ! ,2
6312, tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ? ,3
6313," perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank . ",4
6314," no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . ",1
6315," we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning . ",3
6316," great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain . ",3
6317, no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week . ,4
6318," Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us . ",3
6319,"Hi , Kenny . Let's go for a drink . ",3
6320, Sounds good . Where are we going ? ,2
6321, Somewhere new . It's a great place to pick up chicks . ,1
6322," Need a new . girlfriend , huh ? ",2
6323," Yeah , I broke up with Lisa.She blew a gasket over it . Whoa , get a load of that ! ",1
6324, Whew ! That getup is terrific ! ,1
6325, Never mind the getup.She ' s beautiful ! ,1
6326, That too . ,1
6327, I'm gonna introduce myself . ,1
6328," If you're lucky , that might do the trick . ",1
6329," Oh , oh , that tears it ! I'm getting out of here . ",1
6330, Hold on ! What's the big hurry ? ,2
6331," My ex-girlfriend's here.If she sees me , my goose is cooked . ",1
6332, I wanna finish my drink first . I'll meet you at Sammy's . ,3
6333," OK , catch you later . ",4
6334,Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how are you ? It ’ s been such a long time ! ,2
6335," Darlene ! Indeed , it ’ s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ’ Ve done with your hair ! ",2
6336," Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret ! ",2
6337," Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ’ Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated ! ",1
6338," Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know . ",1
6339, He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course ! ,1
6340," Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently . ",2
6341, Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended . ,1
6342, Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday ! ,1
6343," But of course ! Well , it ’ s been great talking to you , but I have to get going . ",1
6344," Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee ! ",1
6345, That would be great ! Give me a call ! ,3
6346, See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter . ,4
6347,Did you already take the history exam ? ,2
6348, Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ? ,2
6349, I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ? ,2
6350, Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society . ,3
6351, What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ? ,2
6352, I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not . ,1
6353," Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class . ",1
6354," If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go . ",3
6355, Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now . ,4
6356, Good luck . ,1
6357, Thanks . See ya . ,1
6358,"What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable . ",2
6359, It's us . ,1
6360," What do you mean by "" us "" ? ",2
6361," Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . Remember ? ",2
6362," What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ? ",2
6363," Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together . ",1
6364, Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ? ,2
6365, Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ? ,1
6366,"Hey , Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ? ",2
6367, Yes.Do you like it ? ,2
6368, It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent . ,1
6369, Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it . ,2
6370, Is classical music your favorite ? ,2
6371, Yes . What about you ? ,2
6372, I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it . ,1
6373, Pop music doesn't have any depth for me . ,1
6374," Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it . ",1
6375, Did you always like pop music . ,2
6376," I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music . ",1
6377, I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life . ,1
6378," oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play . ",2
6379," Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy . ",1
6380,It was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young . ,1
6381, Most people were living form hand to mouth . How could they ? ,2
6382, Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things . ,1
6383," Fortunately , things are changing these years . ",1
6384,"Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon . ",1
6385," A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ? ",2
6386," There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me . ",3
6387, I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day . ,4
6388, What about sunday ? ,3
6389," i wish i could , but it's my mums birthday . ",4
6390, Maybe next week . ,3
6391," Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work . ",4
6392," Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat . ",1
6393," I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime . ",1
6394,"Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ? ",2
6395," Yeah , I ’ m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains . ",1
6396," Oh , do you go hiking often ? ",2
6397, I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature . ,1
6398, It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? ,2
6399," Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? ",2
6400," Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike . ",1
6401, Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city . ,1
6402," Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . ",1
6403," Well , bring him along too . We ’ ll have a great time this weekend . ",3
6404," Thanks , I ’ ll ask him . ",4
6405,How upsetting ! He has been away for a week ! ,1
6406, I don't know if anything terrible has happened . ,1
6407, I have reported it to the police . ,1
6408, We'd better prepare for the worst . ,1
6409,"You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ? ",2
6410," He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ? ",2
6411, I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles . ,1
6412, I can think of better things to dream about ... ,1
6413," Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away . ",1
6414, That's crazy . ,1
6415,Mike ! Look at the floor ! ,1
6416, What's wrong with it ? ,2
6417, What's wrong with it ? It's filthy ! ,1
6418, Oh ... ,1
6419, It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes . ,1
6420," Sorry , love . ",1
6421, What are you looking for now ? ,2
6422, My cigarettes . ,1
6423," Well , they ' re not here.They are in the dustbin . ",1
6424, In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ? ,1
6425,Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at this university ? ,2
6426," Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad . ",1
6427, It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing . ,1
6428, Are you Chinese by birth ? ,2
6429," Yes , I am . I am from Guangzhou . I am here to study international relations . ",1
6430, How do you like it ? ,2
6431, I like it so far . But my English still needs work . ,1
6432, I want to study Mandarin and public relations . ,1
6433,"Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look . ",3
6434, Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors . ,4
6435, Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that . ,1
6436, Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show . ,1
6437, You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ? ,2
6438, They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim . ,1
6439," Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ? ",2
6440," Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine . ",1
6441, Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ? ,2
6442, It's possible . ,1
6443,You'll never guess what I won at work today ! - Tickets to tonight's final NBA game . ,1
6444," Two , I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me ! ",1
6445," Of course ! And here's the best part , they are court side seats ! ",1
6446, How in the world ! Who came up with seats like that from your company ? ,2
6447, Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team ! ,1
6448, Can't beat that ! Thank you accounting guy ! ,1
6449," The game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five . ",3
6450, What are we waiting for ? Let's go ! ,4
6451,Let ’ s play a game ! ,3
6452, OK ! How about Scrabble ? ,3
6453," No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is ! ",3
6454, OK ! ,4
6455," Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples ! ",1
6456," Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! ",1
6457," Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald ! ",1
6458, Your future husband ! ,1
6459, Not funny . ,1
6460,"As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives . ",1
6461," It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points . ",1
6462, Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone . ,2
6463," For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study . ",1
6464, That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones . ,1
6465," Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them . ",1
6466,"Lee , I'm going to get married next month . ",1
6467, Good news ! And congratulations ! ,1
6468, You are invited to my wedding . ,3
6469, Thank you . I'll certainly be there . ,4
6470,Thank you for lending me the book . ,1
6471," Sure . But it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow . ",3
6472, But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel . I only look up the most necessary ones . ,1
6473,Don ’ t you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers ? ,2
6474, I ’ m afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it . ,1
6475," Don ’ t you think in that case , there wouldn ’ t be so much stealing ? ",2
6476, Definitely . But I think it is too fierce . ,1
6477,"The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ? ",2
6478," Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close . ",1
6479, That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ? ,2
6480, It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ? ,2
6481, Yeah . I think I can find it . ,1
6482, You're back already . That sure was quick . ,1
6483, That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me . ,1
6484," Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time . ",1
6485," Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway . ",3
6486," Okay , let's go ! ",4
6487,"hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ? ",2
6488," well , I spend a lot of time watching movies . ",1
6489," what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too . ",1
6490," oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ? ",2
6491," actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ? ",2
6492," art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too . ",1
6493, really impressive . These two genres are totally different . ,1
6494, sure . I enjoy both of them very much . ,1
6495, how often do you go to the cinema ? ,2
6496," once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon . ",1
6497, movie salon ? where is that ? ,2
6498, it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . I've got a membership there . ,1
6499, is it good ? ,2
6500," yes , you can find almost all new releases there . ",1
6501, really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership . ,2
6502, why not ? ,1
6503,Hey Suzie . Guess what ? I'm having a baby ! ,1
6504, Really ? That's so great . Congratulations . ,1
6505, Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now . ,1
6506, That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ? ,2
6507, Three months . ,1
6508, Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ? ,2
6509," I want to , but Bob doesn't . He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way . ",1
6510, Maybe it's more exciting not knowing . ,1
6511, I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time . ,1
6512, There are so many things you have to prepare for . ,1
6513," I know I am going to be busy , but I know I can handle it . I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time . ",1
6514, It really must be an exciting time for you guys . ,1
6515, Thank you so much . ,1
6516,Mary seems depressed . What ’ s the matter ? ,2
6517, She didn ’ t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ’ s hard work . ,1
6518, Poor girl ! ,1
6519,"Believe it or not , one of the narrowest street in the world is only 49cm wide . ",1
6520, Unbelievable ! How do people go through it ? ,2
6521," That's what I'm wondering , too . ",1
6522, I wish I had a chance to see it with my own eyes . ,1
6523,Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ? ,3
6524," Much to my regret , I'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then . ",4
6525," We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ? ",3
6526," Much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time . ",4
6527, What a pity ! You can't join us . ,1
6528," So sorry . Next time we'll go , thanks anyway . ",1
6529,"I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight , do you think have time ? ",3
6530, Thank you for your inition . I'm free tonight . ,4
6531," Which kind of food do you like , chinese food , western food or sea food ? ",2
6532, I prefer sea food . ,3
6533, ok . I'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm . ,3
6534, That's fine . I'll be waiting for you . ,4
6535, See you later . ,1
6536, bye . ,1
6537,Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already . ,1
6538," If that happen to me , I ’ ll take them back to the shop . ",1
6539, I did . But they said they won ’ t change them . ,1
6540," That ’ s terrible . But if they wouldn ’ t change them , I know what I would do . ",1
6541,Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? ,2
6542, Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it . ,1
6543, Totally agree . What is your solution ? ,2
6544," Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . ",1
6545, You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . ,1
6546, It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . ,1
6547," But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . ",1
6548," I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team . ",1
6549,I am so busy today . ,1
6550, Can I help you ? ,3
6551, I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping . ,3
6552, I ’ ll be glad to help . ,4
6553, Or maybe make the beds . ,3
6554, All you have to do is ask for help . ,4
6555, Thanks . That ’ s terrific ! ,1
6556, I ’ m ready and willing to help . ,1
6557,"The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening . ",1
6558, Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ? ,2
6559, Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them . ,1
6560, Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ? ,3
6561," I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves . ",4
6562, You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different . ,1
6563,You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work . ,1
6564, I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today . ,1
6565, Do you feel ok ? ,2
6566," Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu . ",1
6567, Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now . ,3
6568, Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ? ,3
6569, You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down . ,4
6570," Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting . ",4
6571," Zach , what's that on your arm ? ",2
6572," I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing . ",1
6573, It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ? ,2
6574," Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks . ",1
6575, I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go . ,3
6576, Shouldn't we make an appointment first ? ,2
6577," We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse . ",1
6578, Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting ! ,4
6579,I can't go to your party . ,1
6580, That's too bad . ,1
6581,Do you like being a doctor ? ,2
6582," Yes , most of the time . But , sometimes things can get difficult . ",1
6583, Can you tell me about it ? ,2
6584," You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not . ",1
6585, What can you do when this happens ? ,2
6586," Not much , usually I'll just keep silent . ",1
6587,Have you eaten ? ,2
6588, Not yet . ,1
6589,It's too hot to read . ,1
6590, We'd better go out for a walk . ,3
6591, Which season do you like best ? ,2
6592, Spring . ,1
6593, How about summer ? ,2
6594, I dislike it most . ,1
6595, Why ? ,2
6596, Because the hottest season is summer in a year . ,1
6597, But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons . ,1
6598,My son came home from three years in the navy . ,1
6599, It was a real red letter day for you . ,1
6600, Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home . ,1
6601,"John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? ",2
6602," Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ? ",2
6603," It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day . ",1
6604," You forgot all of about it , didn't you ? ",2
6605,I must be going . ,3
6606, Okay . Keep in touch . ,4
6607,"Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox . ",1
6608," I ’ m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment . ",1
6609," I don ’ t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ? ",2
6610," Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars . ",1
6611, But the reservation keeps the car here . That ’ s why you have the reservation . ,1
6612, I know why we have reservations . ,1
6613," I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them . ",1
6614, But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ’ d like . ,1
6615, Fine . I ’ ll take the compact . ,1
6616," Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ? ",2
6617," Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car . ",1
6618,Do you think Tom will be elected president ? ,2
6619," No , I think Harry will get it . ",1
6620, Let's make a bet on who gets it . ,3
6621," OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night . ",4
6622,I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday . ,1
6623," Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer . ",1
6624," You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ? ",1
6625," To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . ",1
6626," But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive . ",1
6627,What happened ? Why didn't he win ? ,2
6628, Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified . ,2
6629, How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! ,2
6630," If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . ",1
6631, What ? What kind of drugs was he using ? ,2
6632, He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . ,1
6633, I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . ,1
6634, They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . ,1
6635, That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . ,1
6636," I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! ",1
6637," Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . ",1
6638," I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . ",1
6639, Let's hope so . ,1
6640,"Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ? ",2
6641, That's because Americans love sitcoms . ,1
6642, Sitcoms ? ,2
6643," Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values . ",1
6644," In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies . ",1
6645, I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time . ,1
6646,Are you interested in history ? ,2
6647," Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . ",1
6648," I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . ",1
6649, I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks ! ,1
6650, Some people say that history repeats itself . ,1
6651," What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ? ",2
6652," The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . ",1
6653, I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again . ,1
6654,You're looking great . ,1
6655," You , too . ",1
6656,"What's the matter , John ? you seemed to be restless today . ",2
6657," You see , I've been offered a new job . I can't decide whether to take it or not . ",1
6658," Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice . ",1
6659, It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging . ,1
6660, Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ? ,2
6661," Yes , they say I would get a big sum . ",1
6662, Have you discussed it with your wife ? ,2
6663," Yes , she leaves it to me . ",1
6664, As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary . ,3
6665, I have to think about it . ,4
6666,Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ? ,2
6667," Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L . ",1
6668, Of course . ,1
6669,I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0.1 of a second . ,1
6670, That ’ s great . He ’ s the best runner I ’ Ve seen this season . I ’ m sure he ’ ll win a medal at the Olympics . ,1
6671, I think you ’ re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ’ ll win ? ,2
6672," I really don ’ t know . I don ’ t think we ’ ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones . ",1
6673, What do you think our chance are in other events . ,2
6674," In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ’ ll do well in those same events . ",1
6675, We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice . ,1
6676, I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total . ,1
6677, You are very optimistic ! ,1
6678,"Helen , did you hear I ’ m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place . ",3
6679," I may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me . ",4
6680," Well , drop by if you can . ",1
6681," I will , do you want me to bring anything ? ",2
6682," No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there . ",3
6683,It's said that John's broken up . ,1
6684, Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot . ,2
6685, I hear that John's leading a double wife . ,1
6686, It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife . ,1
6687,Let's play chess . ,3
6688, I haven't played chess for a long time . ,4
6689," That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play . ",1
6690," Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing . ",1
6691, You're a very good player ,1
6692," Not really , but once I won a prize . ",1
6693, So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners . ,1
6694, My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously . ,3
6695,You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? ,2
6696," Yeah , about . ",1
6697, Do you know Chinese better now ? ,2
6698," Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . ",1
6699," Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere . ",1
6700," I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . ",1
6701, A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it . ,1
6702, I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time . ,1
6703," Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us . ",1
6704," Yes , absolutely true . ",1
6705,"Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ? ",2
6706, Harry Potter . ,1
6707, Harry Potter ? Is that book funny ? ,2
6708," Actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that's funny . ",1
6709, Got it . ,1
6710, Have you ever read this book before ? ,2
6711," No , but my little brother likes it very much . ",1
6712, It's really a good book . You will like it too . ,3
6713," I'll try to read it . Actually , I like literature very much . ",4
6714," Wow , that sounds like a scholar . By the way , who's your favorite writer ? ",2
6715, Jane Austen . ,1
6716, Me too . Pride and Prejudice is my favorite . ,1
6717, I like it too . But Sense and Sensibility is my favorite . ,1
6718,"Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren . ",1
6719," Thanks , Tim.Nice meeting you , too . ",1
6720, I guess we'll see just around . ,3
6721," Ye , I hope so.well.Take it easy . ",3
6722, You too . ,4
6723,"Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious ! ",2
6724, I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit ! ,1
6725, But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you ! ,1
6726, Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles ! ,1
6727, What kind of power struggles are you talking about ? ,2
6728," Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career ! ",1
6729, So he talks about you behind your back ? ,2
6730, Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back ! ,1
6731, I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas . ,1
6732, I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort . ,1
6733," My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO . ",1
6734,"Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! ",1
6735, What is it ? What happened ? ,2
6736, I think someone is stalking me . ,1
6737," No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? ",1
6738," I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . ",1
6739, What did you do ? ,2
6740," I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . ",1
6741, Did he leave when you left ? ,2
6742, Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . ,1
6743, What did you do ? ,2
6744,"Man , I'm hungry . Do you know a good place to have lunch ? ",2
6745," Yes , I know a great place . What types of food do you like ? ",2
6746," Mexican , Japanese or Chinese would be great . ",1
6747," Oh , I know a place where you might like to eat . ",1
6748, Is it close by ? ,2
6749, It's down a block on the right ; can I show you the way ? ,3
6750," OK , I'd love the company . ",4
6751, This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it . ,1
6752,have you ever been to Disneyworld ? ,2
6753," when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? ",2
6754," the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland . ",1
6755, that's right . Why do you ask ? ,2
6756," well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon . ",1
6757, when are you getting married ? ,2
6758, some time next year . We haven't set the date yet . ,1
6759, congratulations ! I had no idea . ,1
6760, thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ? ,2
6761, do you like amusement parks ? ,2
6762," for the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though . ",1
6763," if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time . ",1
6764, even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ? ,2
6765," even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun . ",1
6766, thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight . ,1
6767, I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! ,1
6768,Matthew ? Hi ! ,2
6769, Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ? ,2
6770, It's got to be almost a year now . ,1
6771, How have you been ? ,2
6772, I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it . ,1
6773," Yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ? ",2
6774, Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck . ,1
6775," Well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ? ",2
6776, Mrs . Thou ? ,2
6777," Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . ",3
6778, Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days ! ,4
6779, I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ? ,2
6780,Are you ready to go to the mall ? ,2
6781, Yeah . Dig my new pants ? ,2
6782, Copycat ! ,1
6783, What do you mean ? ,2
6784," You went out and bought khakis , too ! ",1
6785, No . Mine are a soft brown . Yours are khaki . ,1
6786, Whatever . ,1
6787,Have heard of Paul ? ,2
6788," No , what ? ",2
6789, He's got a promotion . ,1
6790, You're kidding . ,1
6791," No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells . ",1
6792, I don't believe it.He is only being with the company for two years . ,1
6793," Well , it's true.The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul . ",1
6794, Well.Good for him . ,1
6795,"Jeff , I'm going to the supermarket . Do you want to come with me ? ",3
6796, I think the supermarket is closed now . ,4
6797," Oh , When does it close ? ",2
6798, It closes at 7:00 on Sundays . ,1
6799, That's too bad . ,1
6800," Don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . It opens at 8: 00 . ",3
6801, Alright . What do you want to do now ? ,2
6802, Let's take a walk for a half an hour . My sister will get here at about 8: 30PM and then we can all go out to dinner . ,3
6803, Where does she live ? ,2
6804, She lives in San Francisco . ,1
6805, How long has she lived there ? ,2
6806, I think she's lived there for about 10 years . ,1
6807, That's a long time . Where did she live before that ? ,2
6808, San Diego . ,1
6809,"Hey , Peter , have you had lunch yet ? ",2
6810, No . How about you ? ,2
6811, Not yet . Let's go to that restaurant on the corner . ,1
6812,Who's that ? ,2
6813, Search me . ,1
6814,I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me . ,1
6815, What did you argue about ? ,2
6816, He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet . ,1
6817," Well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair . ",1
6818," Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry . ",1
6819, Did you lend him a lot of money ? ,2
6820," Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back . ",1
6821," Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ? ",2
6822," No , we didn ’ t . I guess you ’ re right . We should patch things up . ",1
6823," Of course you should . You wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ? ",2
6824,Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy . ,2
6825, I don ’ t think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking . ,1
6826, Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good . ,1
6827," No , you can ’ t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres . ",1
6828,Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ? ,2
6829, Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world . ,1
6830, They must be amazing animals . ,1
6831, They are . I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea . ,1
6832, I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men . ,1
6833, They sure can . Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes . ,1
6834,"Oh dear , my weight has gone up again . ",1
6835," I am not surprised , you eat too much . ",1
6836, And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help . ,1
6837," No , I wouldn't think so . ",1
6838, I do wish I could lose weight . ,1
6839," Well , why don't you go on the diet ? ",3
6840, I've tried diets before but they've never worked . ,4
6841, Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class . ,3
6842," Yes , maybe I should . ",4
6843,Could you please wait for a minute ? I'll buy the tickets ,3
6844, All right . ,4
6845, Here is your ticket . ,1
6846, Thank you . ,1
6847, The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now . ,3
6848, Really ? ,2
6849," Yes , let's go in . ",3
6850," It is a new park , isn't it ? ",2
6851," Yes , how do you know ? ",2
6852, I guessed it . ,1
6853," Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well . ",1
6854," Oh , how wonderful ! ",1
6855,I was just watching a documentary on TV about how people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting . ,1
6856," I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers . ",1
6857, The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow . ,1
6858, Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation . ,1
6859, Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts . ,1
6860, Can you ride a horse ? ,2
6861," Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ? ",2
6862, I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? ,3
6863, What a good idea ! ,4
6864,Where's Mrs . Johnson ? ,2
6865," Just call her Lisa , Mary . She's cooking dinner . ",3
6866, I see . Can I sit down ? ,3
6867, Of course ! Make yourself at home . ,4
6868," Thank you , Mr . Johnson . ",1
6869," Please , just call me Tom . ",3
6870," Okay , Tom . ",4
6871, Where's Cindy ? ,2
6872, She's upstairs in my room . ,1
6873, Can you tell her to come downstairs ? We're about to have dinner . ,3
6874,Have you heard of Paul ? ,2
6875," No , what ? ",2
6876, He's got a promotion . ,1
6877, You're kidding . ,1
6878," No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells . ",1
6879," Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years . ",1
6880," Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul . ",1
6881, Well . Good for him . ,1
6882,Let's speed up . We're going to be late again . ,1
6883," If we hurry , can we get there in time ? ",2
6884, I hope so . ,1
6885,Is it your first time to join the sports meeting of Junior High School ? ,2
6886," Yes , and it's great . What are the events at the sports meeting ? ",2
6887," Long-distance race , dash , hurdle race , relay race , standing long jump , high jump , shotput and so on . ",1
6888," Our neighbor , Bruce , will take part in the relay race . Let's go have a look . ",3

6902,The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors . ,1
6903, It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it . ,1
6904, Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon . ,1
6905, That's true . ,1
6906,I ’ m forming a music band . ,1

6908," Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band . ",1
6909," Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? ",2
6910," We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ? ",2
6911," Yes , I ’ m a singer . ",1
6912, Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house . ,3
6913," Great ! Wait here ? You don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ? ",4
6914,What would you like for Christmas ? ,2
6915, I would like to have that new style Gl Joe . ,1
6916, Have you asked Santa ? ,2
6917, Yes and I've written him a letter . ,1
6918,"Lili , let ’ s take a vacation ! ",3
6919," George , how can we ? Vacations cost money . And this month we don ’ t have much money left after paying the rent . ",2
6920," Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ’ t cost much . ",3
6921," Where will we sleep , then ? ",2
6922, In the van . ,1
6923, What about other expenses ? ,2
6924," Let ’ s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ’ t we ? ",2
6925, Maybe you ’ re right . When do you plan to go ? ,2
6926, The sooner the better ! I can ’ t wait ! ,1
6927," Oh , I don ’ t know where we ’ re going yet . ",1
6928," As long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time . ",1
6929, Let ’ s go to Chicago.We can have lunch in Chinatown.Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field ! ,3
6930, You have such good ideas ! ,4
6931,What date will our field trip be on ? ,2
6932, The science field trip is next Monday at 8 o'clock in the morning . Do you want to make note of that on your calendar ? ,2
6933," Yes , I will make note of that . ",1
6934," Next Monday is December 2nd . The buses will leave at 8 , but we must begin loading at 7 ",1
6935, I will be there half an hour early . ,1

6941,The acting of this film is marvelous in spite of the thin plot . ,1
6942, I'm sorry for hero . ,1
6943, I don't think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts . ,1
6944, Don't be too critical . We can't expect it to be perfect . ,1
6945,How was your business trip ? ,2
6946, Great - they wined and dined us all week . ,1
6947,Nice to meet you here.How come you dropped into this company today ? ,2
6948, My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office . I didn't know you were working here.What a surprise.How long have you been doing this ? ,2
6949, Two years or so . ,1
6950, That is great.Do you have to work the night shift ? ,2
6951," No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week . ",1
6952, Do you enjoy work here ? ,2
6953," It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy . ",1
6954, Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job . ,1
6955, Luckily not.The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss . ,1
6956, Glad to hear that . ,1
6957,Scientists have found a second solar system in the universe . ,1
6958, What's the second solar system ? ,2
6959," It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it . ",1
6960, Is this good news or bad news ? ,2
6961," It's exciting news ! If we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth ! ",1
6962, You mean with people on it ? ,2
6963, Yes ! Isn't that exciting ? ,2
6964,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? ,2
6965," Sorry , I thought you knew . ",1
6966, But you should tell me you were in love with her . ,1
6967, Didn't I ? ,2
6968, You know you didn't . ,1
6969," Well , I am telling you now . ",1
6970," Yes , but you might have told me before . ",1
6971, I didn't think you would be interested . ,1
6972, You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? ,2
6973," Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . ",1
6974," Oh , you men ! You are all the same . ",1
6975,How was the movie last night ? ,2
6976, I didn't really like it . ,1
6977, Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . ,1
6978, I found it very disappointing . ,1
6979," She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . ",1
6980, I wasn't happy with it . ,1
6981, Nothing is to your satisfaction . ,1
6982,"Honey , I ’ ll be right back ! ",1
6983, Where are you going ? ,2
6984, I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done . ,1
6985," Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? ",2
6986," Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me ! ",1
6987, Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that ! ,2
6988," They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish ! ",1
6989," Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do . ",1
6990,Good afternoon ! ,1
6991," Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ? ",2
6992," I'm very well , thank you.How are you ? ",2
6993," Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ? ",2
6994," Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot . ",1
6995, Yes . ,1
6996, What's the weather like in your country ? ,2
6997, Mm ... It's quite warm now . ,1
6998, Where do you live ? ,2
6999, In London.Where do you live ? ,2
7000, Here.Near this school . ,1
7001,I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! ,1
7002, So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? ,2
7003," That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! ",1
7004, Have you ever written up a business plan before ? ,2
7005," Well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? ",2
7006," You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . ",1
7007," Well , that seems easy enough . ",1
7008," Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . ",1
7009, Geez . Is that all ? ,2
7010," Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! ",1
7011, Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! ,1
7012,I hear that Mary got mad . ,1
7013, So I heard . ,1
7014, What ’ s wrong with her ? ,2
7015, She went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident . ,1
7016,"Um , what will you do this weekend ? ",2
7017, How about a movie ? We haven't done that for a while . ,3
7018, A movie ? Sure . Do you know what's on right now ? ,2
7019, No . Why don't you check out the newspaper ? ,3
7020," Ok . Maybe you should invite your sister along , too . ",4
7021,What ’ s on TV tonight ? ,2
7022," Not much , that new reality-TV show , Ally McNeal , oooo , Dark Angel . ",1
7023, Wait a second . I want to watch Ally McNeal . ,3
7024," Oh , come on . That ’ s such a girl ’ s show . ",4
7025, No it ’ s not . It ’ s just funny . ,1
7026," Yeah , if you ’ re a girl . ",1
7027," Well , you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl . ",1
7028, That ’ s not true . Dark Angel is a good show . ,1
7029, It ’ s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits . ,1
7030," O . K . , O . K . Let ’ s forget it . There ’ s a football game on too . ",3
7031, No way . I ’ m watching Ally McNeal . Go to John ’ s to watch the game . ,4
7032,It ’ s really terrible ! ,1
7033, What are you talking about ? ,2
7034, Don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all . ,1
7035, You said it . Many parents just don ’ t know how to educate their children . ,1
7036,"Sarah , what did you do today ? ",2
7037, I went shopping . ,1
7038, Did you buy anything ? ,2
7039," Yes , I bought a few things . ",1
7040, What did you buy ? ,2
7041, I bought this coat . Do you like it ? ,2
7042," Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ? ",2
7043, At the mall on 5th street . ,1
7044, Was it expensive ? ,2
7045," No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars . ",1
7046, That's cheap . ,1
7047, I know . It was a really good deal . ,1
7048, I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately . ,1
7049,"Hi , Victor . How are you ? ",2
7050," Oh , I'm fine . ",1
7051," So , are you going to go to class tonight ? ",2
7052, Maybe ... but I don't think so . ,1
7053, Really ? What's the matter ? ,2
7054, I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad . ,1
7055," Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner . ",3
7056," Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already . ",4
7057,How's John doing ? ,2
7058, He can barely make ends meet . ,1
7059,The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 . ,1
7060, They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 . ,1
7061," If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final . ",1
7062," No way , if it still has 21 . ",1
7063,What's that book you have under your arm ? ,2
7064, It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . ,1
7065, How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn . ,2
7066, I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day . ,1
7067, Is it really worth paying for ? ,2
7068, I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter . ,1
7069," If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . ",1
7070,"Come on , you are left behind ! ",1
7071," Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey . ",1
7072, You just need more exercise . ,1
7073," Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing ! ",1
7074, I don't care . I want to burn up my fat . ,1
7075, But running so fast is not good for people over forties . ,1
7076, Why ? ,2
7077, We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us . ,1
7078, But I want to burn up more calories ! ,1
7079," In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time . ",1
7080, Really ? I will slow down then . ,2
7081,"Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ? ",2
7082," Fine , thank you . I haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ? ",2
7083," I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films . ",1
7084," Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary . ",2
7085," Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them . ",1
7086," It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one . ",1
7087, But it's really exciting . ,1
7088," Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one . ",1
7089, Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror . ,1
7090, Yep . ,1
7091, I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind . ,1
7092," Maybe . After all , I am grown up now . ",1
7093,"It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession . ",1
7094, The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports . ,1
7095," Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . ",1
7096," It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy . ",1
7097,Are you an art aficionado ? ,2
7098," Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ? ",2
7099," I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . ",1
7100, I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school . ,1
7101, Art isn ’ t for everyone . I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture . ,1
7102," I like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ’ d love to go with you . ",2
7103, I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there . ,3
7104, That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? ,2
7105, Let ’ s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits . ,4
7106,"What does your mother do , may I ask ? ",2
7107, My mother works in a company as an accountant . ,1
7108, Is she busy ? ,2
7109," Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year . ",1
7110,"Hello , Bessie . ",1
7111," Hello , Jack.Happy birthday ! ",1
7112," My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday . ",2
7113," I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them . ",1
7114, Thanks a lot . I'm so touched . ,1
7115," Now let me sing "" Happy birthday "" for you . ",1
7116, Thank you very much . ,1
7117,"Nice day , isn't it ? ",2
7118, It sure is . ,1
7119, It's a good day for a picnic . ,1
7120,"Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ? ",3
7121, I don't want to . ,4
7122," Well , come over and talk to me then . ",3
7123, Certainly not . ,4
7124, May I turn on the TV then ? ,3
7125, Turn on the TV for what ? ,2
7126, So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . ,3
7127," Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? ",2
7128," I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner . ",3
7129," To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it . ",4
7130,Diane Grant ? I haven't seen you for ages ! ,2
7131, Brian ! How have you been ? ,2
7132," Pretty good . Say , you've really changed ! ",1
7133," Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before . ",1
7134," Well , you look great ! How are you ? ",2
7135, I'm doing really well . I got married about three years ago . I have two kids now . ,1
7136, That's terrific ! ,1
7137,How is your new dormitory ? ,2
7138," It's very nice . There are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly . ",1
7139," Well , do you all major in the same subject ? ",2
7140," No , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating . ",1
7141, That's great ! ,1
7142,"Peter , how often do you exercise ? ",2
7143," Well , I swim and run every day . ",1
7144," Now , tell me , what do you eat ? ",2
7145," Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs . ",1
7146, Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? ,2
7147," Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit . ",1
7148, What do you drink ? ,2
7149," Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . ",1
7150,What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? ,2
7151, We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River . ,3
7152, How hard is the climb ? ,2
7153, It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . ,1
7154, What did you do last week ? ,2
7155, We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting . ,1
7156, Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it . ,1
7157," Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . ",3
7158," Yeah , I will . See you then ! ",4
7159, O . K . See you . ,1
7160,How many languages can you speak ? ,2
7161, I can speak French and German . ,1
7162, How well can you speak them ? ,2
7163," I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well . ",1
7164, Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ? ,2
7165," No , but I'll be able to tomorrow . ",1
7166,Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? ,2
7167, Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes . ,1
7168, It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . ,1
7169, You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler . ,1
7170," Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! ",1
7171, It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards . ,1
7172,Do you really have to work today ? ,2
7173, Yes . I'm afraid so . ,1
7174, But you'll miss out on the football game . ,1
7175," Oh . Well , it can't be helped . ",1
7176,How smart of you to book the tickets before hand ! ,1
7177," Oh , do you really think so ? ",2
7178," Of course , otherwise you ’ ll just have to wait for hours . ",1
7179, But I just got a call from my sister and I have to cancel the movie tonight . ,1
7180,I had an accident . ,1
7181, That's terrible ! ,1
7182,"I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last . ",1
7183, You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining . ,1
7184,"Tom , I won first prize in the poetry contest . ",1
7185, Come on ! You're pulling my leg . ,1
7186, Really ! Here's my trophy . ,1
7187, Wow ! Congratulations ! ,1
7188,What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring . ,1
7189, Thank you . ,1
7190, Is that your wedding ring ? ,2
7191, I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring . ,1
7192," Well , congratulations . When is the big date ? ",2
7193, In June . ,1
7194, Did you have the watch before getting the ring ? ,2
7195," Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch . ",1
7196, You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous . ,1
7197, Thank you so much . ,1
7198, What kind of watch is it ? ,2
7199, It's a Tag Heer . ,1
7200," If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ? ",2
7201, This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 . ,1
7202, That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for . ,1
7203, Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones . ,1
7204,I'm really mad at Bob . ,1
7205, What for ? ( Why ? ) ,2
7206,"Hi , Jack , how have you been ? ",2
7207, Not very well . ,1
7208, Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ? ,2
7209, Nothing . ,1
7210," Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter . ",1
7211," Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane . ",1
7212," Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher . ",1
7213," Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young . ",1
7214," Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family . ",1
7215, Maybe you're right . ,1
7216," Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match ! ",1
7217," Yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . You know , we were together for almost five years . It's really hard ... ",1
7218,Do you know Sally ? ,2
7219, Sally . She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . ,1
7220, Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop clock . ,2
7221," Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career . ",1
7222,Excuse me . Do you have the time ? ,2
7223," My watch is a few minutes fast . It's about six forty , I think . ",1
7224," Is it ? Oh , no . The concert will begin in twenty minutes . Are we too late to get there ? ",2
7225," If we start now , we can make it by taxi . ",1
7226,Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? ,2
7227, Yeah . ,1
7228, Who won ? ,2
7229, China . ,1
7230, What is the score ? ,2
7231, China beat Brazil three to zero . ,1
7232, Wonderful . ,1
7233,"What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in . ",2
7234, The boss wanted to pay Bob with stock options . But Bob didn't want to play that game again . ,1
7235, Again ? ,2
7236," At his last start-up , Bob worked for stock and no salary . They folded and he made zip . ",1
7237, Ouch . ,1
7238, Now he only works freelance . Hundred bucks an hour . ,1
7239,"You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill . ",1
7240, I'm sorry . I won't do it again . ,1
7241, Try to be more careful in future . Look ! you've damaged the sign . ,1
7242, Is this the sign ? What does it says ? ,2
7243, It says No smoking here . ,1
7244,Good morning . I ’ m from the New York book review . Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ? ,2
7245, Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ? ,2
7246," First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story . ",1
7247, That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case . ,1
7248, How do you research your books ? ,2
7249, I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people . ,1
7250, I really like your books . I ’ Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again ! ,1
7251, Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go . ,1
7252, Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ? ,2
7253," There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your business card , I ’ ll make sure you get an advance copy to review . ",1
7254, Thanks very much . I ’ m sure it will sell well . I can ’ t wait to read it . Here ’ s my card . Thank you for you time . ,1
7255,What shall I call him ? ,2
7256," Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry . ",1
7257, What's he doing ? ,2
7258, He's checking bags.He ' s an official in the customs . ,1
7259,For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party . ,1
7260, That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library ! ,1
7261, I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas . ,3
7262, That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there . ,4
7263, Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people . ,1
7264, Will it be an all day event ? ,2
7265, Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library . ,1
7266, That was quick thinking . ,1
7267,I'm so glad I bought this watch ! ,1
7268, Cool ! Flashy red lines ! ,1
7269, I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned . ,1
7270, Is it waterproof ? ,2
7271, Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am . ,1
7272," Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ? ",2
7273," Well , surfing , scuba diving ... ",1
7274,Do you take a bus to and from work ? ,2
7275," Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction . ",1
7276," Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded . ",1
7277," Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt . ",1
7278," That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus . ",1
7279, What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ? ,2
7280," You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! ",1
7281," Hmm . Good exercise , uh ? ",2
7282," Yeah , absolutely ! ",1
7283," And it ’ s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her . ",1
7284," You were so happy , weren ’ t you ? ",2
7285, What do you think ? I ’ m a good boy . ,2
7286,We are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center . ,1
7287, That's great . ,1
7288, Now let's get things ready . ,3
7289, Don't worry . There are all kinds of things in the center . ,4
7290, That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings . ,1
7291,"Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements . ",1
7292," Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice . ",1
7293, And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water . ,1
7294," Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together . ",1
7295, There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming . ,1
7296," That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games . ",1
7297," Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you . ",1
7298," My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you . ",1
7299," OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool . ",1
7300," Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that . ",1
7301,It seems that nobody in your class likes Paul . ,1
7302, The boy is good for nothing . ,1
7303," As a teacher , I don ’ t know how to help him . ",1
7304, He is hopeless . ,1
7305,"Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ? ",2
7306," Not bad.We have had a big meeting today , remember ? ",2
7307," Oh , yea . I forgot.So how did it go ? ",2
7308, Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas . ,1
7309," Great , so what happens now ? ",2
7310," Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it . ",1
7311,Do you believe in UFOs ? ,2
7312," Of course , they are out there . ",1
7313, But I never saw them . ,1
7314," Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them . ",2
7315, You mean that you can them . ,1
7316, That's right . I can see them in my dreams . ,1
7317, They come to the earth ? ,2
7318, No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space . ,1
7319, Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ? ,2
7320," OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings . ",1
7321, That means that you talk to them ? In which language ? ,2
7322," Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too . ",1
7323, Wow . Sounds fantastic ! ,1
7324,"You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ? ",2
7325, Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest . ,1
7326, Really ? Congratulations ! ,1
7327," Thank you , Paul . ",1
7328," By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday . ",3

7330," Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ? ",3
7331," Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me . ",4
7332, My pleasure . ,1
7333,Do you have a minute ? ,2
7334, Sure . What's up ? ,2
7335,"Hey , May , look , Is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday ? ",2
7336," Yes , that's right . That's the poster of the The Witch . ",1
7337," May , I really regret watching it with you last night . ",1
7338, Did it scare you ? ,2
7339, Of course not . I just thought the movie was ... boring . ,1
7340," Boring ? Come on , you clutched to my arm all the time . ",2
7341," Well , I admit . The ghosts were scary . ",1
7342, I like scary movies . ,1
7343, That's Gucci's influence . I love science fiction movies ! ,1
7344, Of course you do . They are silly stories just for little kids like you . ,1
7345, Don't call me kid . I am a grownup . ,1
7346, Do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight ? ,3
7347, Of course ! I can watch them without you ! ,4
7348," Oh , really ? ",2
7349,What is your nationality ? ,2
7350, I am Chinese by birth . ,1

7358," Yeah , I know . ",1
7359,"Say , what's your favorite sport ? ",2
7360, Mmmm ... it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess I like tennis better . ,1
7361, Do you play much tennis ? ,2
7362," Yes , quite a bit . How about a game sometime ? ",3
7363," Sorry . I'm strictly a spectator-football , baseball , basketball , golf ... I watch them all . ",4

7383," It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks . ",1

7397, There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers . ,1
7398, Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa . ,2

7434, You must feel terrible now . ,1
7435, Yeah . ,1
7436," I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly , it got better . I know you'll feel better too . ",1
7437, You've been through this too ? ,2
7438," Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups . ",1
7439, But it hurts too much . ,1
7440," I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls . ",1
7441, What if I don't want to find another girl ? ,2
7442," You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover . ",1
7443, You're right . ,1
7444," I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ? ",2
7445, Yeah . Thanks for the talk . ,1
7446, I'll give you a call later . We should hang out . It's good to be around people . ,1

7451," No , I can ’ t let you have it for 12.How about 14 ? ",3
7452, 13.50 ? ,3
7453," Sorry , $ 14 is the lowest I can go . ",4
7454,I ’ m afraid I spoke in all of the table clock . ,1
7455, Never mind about that . ,1
7456," I ’ m terribly sorry , Won ’ t you let me pay for ? ",3
7457," No , I won ’ t hear of it . ",4
7458,"A :: Mr Clinton , it's nice to see you again . ",1
7459," Nice to see you again , too . Peter . How's your family ? ",2
7460, A :: Very well . How's Mrs Clinton ? ,2
7461," Not bad , But she's as busy as before . ",1
7462,"Whatever we do , we should do it above board . ",1
7463, You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table . ,1
7464," Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels . ",1
7465,"Morning , Zina . Just wanted to say thanks again ! ",1
7466," Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ? ",2
7467," Oh , yeah . I'm glad you mentioned that . I think we need to hire somebody new to manage it . ",1
7468, Can't Elvin handle it ? ,2
7469, I think he's got too much on his plate . ,1
7470,This is the best dinner I've ever had . ,1
7471, How about the soup ? ,2
7472, I've never tasted anything better . ,1
7473, How nice of you to say so . ,1
7474,"Hey Nick , what are you up to ? ",2
7475," Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ? ",3
7476, Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man . ,4
7477," Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim . ",3
7478, Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower ! ,4
7479," Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . For example , never handle a weapon that you haven ’ t inspected yourself . Always make sure there isn ’ t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot ! ",1
7480," Wow , I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies ! ",1
7481," The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ? ",2
7482, Let ’ s do it ! ,1
7483,"Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven ’ t seen you for a while . ",2
7484, I ’ m fine . I ’ Ve been out of town . I just got back . ,1

7489," Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ? ",3
7490," Just look around ? Ah , that's boring . ",4
7491, I'll go myself then . ,1
7492,"What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps . ",2
7493, I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated . ,1
7494," come on , nothing can be that bad . ",2
7495," but promise me , you'll keep it a secret . ",3
7496," ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ? ",2
7497, I've fallen in love with my boss . ,1
7498, really ? Is he married ? ,2
7499," no , of course not . He is still single . ",1
7500, then what's your problem ? ,2
7501, I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . ,1
7502," oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . ",1
7503," worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . ",1
7504, office romance is very tricky . ,1
7505, it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . ,1
7506," cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . ",3
7507,You're not looking happy . What's the matter ? ,2
7508," Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . ",1

7511, A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday . ,3
7512," It wasn't always like this , you know . ",4
7513, What do you mean ? ,2
7514," Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives . ",1
7515, You need a holiday . That's what's the matter . ,3
7516," Certainly , perhaps . ",4
7517,"I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is . ",1
7518," Hey , Isabelle ... ",1
7519, Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . ,1
7520," Yes , I am the guy . ",1
7521, What a bummer ! You set me up ? ,2
7522, Let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... ,1
7523, How dare you ! ( starts to walk off ) ,1
7524," Hang on one second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! ",1
7525, Why did you lie to me in the email ? ,2
7526, I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . ,1
7527, I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . ,1
7528," I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over . ",1
7529,"Peter , how often do you exercise ? ",2
7530," Well , I swim and run every day . ",1

7534," Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit . ",1
7535, What do you drink ? ,2
7536," Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . ",1
7537, What do you drink ? ,2
7538,Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? ,2
7539, Yeah . ,1
7540, Who won ? ,2

7543, China beat Brazil 3 to 0 . ,1
7544, Wonderful ! ,1
7545,"Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work . ",1
7546, I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in . ,1
7547," Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client . ",1
7548," I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . ",1
7549," It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale . ",1
7550," Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day ! ",1
7551,Isn't it wonderful walking here ? ,2
7552, What do you mean ? ,2
7553, I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us . ,1
7554," Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall . ",1
7555, It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? ,2
7556," You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . ",1
7557, What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? ,2
7558, Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture . ,1
7559, What's there after that ? ,2
7560," Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . ",1
7561, What are they all for ? ,2
7562," Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places . ",1
7563,"Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ? ",2
7564, I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them . ,1
7565, What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ? ,2
7566, Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend . ,1
7567, And your parents took it badly ? ,2
7568, That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her . ,1
7569," Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ? ",2
7570," She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away . ",1
7571, How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ? ,2
7572, Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage . ,1
7573, Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea . ,2
7574, What do you mean ? ,2
7575," Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not . ",1
7576," I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out . ",1
7577,Do you think they two will get married ? ,2
7578," Yeah , you can count on it . ",1
7579," I think so . Yes , they get along so well . ",1
7580, I like him . He's good for her . ,1
7581, You're right . He sure is . ,1
7582,What do you think of Frank ? ,2
7583, He is all right . But I think he seems to have no back bone . ,1
7584, Why do you say that ? ,2
7585," Whatever things get tough , he gives in . ",1
7586,Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight . ,1
7587, Don't worry . We'll make it back to the camp site before dark . ,1
7588, I sure hope so . ,1
7589,"Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? ",2
7590," Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . ",1
7591, I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? ,2
7592, Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . ,1
7593, It must be interesting to study English . ,1
7594, Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . ,1
7595, Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? ,2
7596, Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . ,1
7597,It's quiet everywhere in winter . ,1
7598, Yes . I like winter . ,1
7599, Me too . ,1
7600, It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ? ,3
7601, That's a good idea . Let's go ! ,4
7602, What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen . ,1
7603, Take care ! Don't slip on the ground . ,1
7604, I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice . ,1
7605, Yes . Very wonderful . ,1
7606, There is a snowman over there . ,1
7607, How lovely it is ! ,1
7608,Tim's always bothering me . ,1
7609, Just tell him off . ,1
7610,Who are those guys ? ,2
7611," Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O ’ Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ’ star players . ",1
7612, Oh . ,1
7613," Wait a second . He shoots , he scores ! ",1
7614, All right ! ,1
7615," Here comes Jordan , though . ",1
7616," Wow , Michael Jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch . ",1
7617," Yeah . He ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing . ",1
7618, Which team do you think will win ? ,2
7619, The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has . ,1
7620,"I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr.Stone . ",1
7621, It's ok . What do you want to ask ? ,2
7622, Where should I go after I arrived at the university ? ,2
7623, The first place you should go is the International Center . ,3
7624, Why ? ,2
7625, You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers . ,3
7626, What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ? ,2
7627," They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you . ",1
7628, Can we get any more help at the International Center ? ,2
7629," Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office . ",3
7630, I see . It must be worth going to . ,4
7631," Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year . ",1
7632, Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students . ,1
7633," It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them . ",1
7634,"hi , Lander . What's wrong ? ",2
7635, I can hardly make ends meet these days . ,1
7636, same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months . ,1
7637, my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise . ,1
7638, true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . ,1
7639, definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month . ,1
7640," the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken . ",1
7641, is that inflation ? ,2
7642," inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation . ",1
7643, has the government taken some measures to curb it ? ,2
7644, yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy . ,1
7645, but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy . ,1
7646, you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending . ,1
7647, how ? ,2
7648," for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense . ",3
7649, sounds a good idea . ,4
7650,"OK , everyone . Gather around . Here are the rules . No tackling . No pushing . ",1
7651, You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul . ,1
7652, Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched . ,1
7653, You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees . ,1
7654," The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play ! ",1
7655," Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men . ",1
7656,Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ? ,2
7657," Yeah , almost . But there is one thing . ",1
7658, What ? ,2
7659," I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... ",1
7660, What is it ? ,2
7661, Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . ,1
7662, That makes you feel uncomfortable ? ,2
7663, Yeah . we never do that in a public office . ,1
7664, Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy . ,1
7665," I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding . ",1
7666," Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . ",1
7667, Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? ,2
7668, Yeah . ,1
7669," Oh , I'm shocked . ",1
7670,What courses did you take in college ? ,2
7671," I took a lot of courses , such as Philosophy , Logic , Ethics , Aesthetics , etc . ",1
7672, Which course did you like best ? ,2
7673, I liked Aesthetics best . It is very impressive . ,1
7674,Hi . Have you got a personal computer ? ,2
7675, Certainly . What's the matter ? ,2
7676, I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet . ,1
7677, Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores . ,1
7678, Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ? ,2
7679," That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place . ",1
7680, Is the service charged ? ,2
7681, No . it's free . ,1
7682, Really . I'll get a computer at once . ,1
7683,We are planning to go to Beidaihe for vacation . Do you want to go with us ? ,3
7684, It ’ s so cool ! ,4
7685,"Excuse me , is this seat taken ? ",3
7686, I ’ m afraid this seat is taken . ,4
7687, Oh . is it . Thank you anyway . ,1
7688, You ’ re welcome . Why don ’ t you ask the conductor when he comes by ? ,3
7689, Thank you . ,4
7690,I prefer potatoes to eggplants . ,1
7691, I feel eggplants are more nutritious . ,1
7692," But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better . ",1
7693," Oh , that's how you see it . ",1
7694,Are you sure you can't lend me five thousand dollars ? ,3
7695," Hmm ... I'll tell you what . I'll lend you four thousand dollars , but you have to pay me back next week . ",4
7696, It's a deal . ,1
7697,Where do you plan to go this winter ? ,2
7698," Alps , suppose . ",1
7699," Oh , yes , you like skiing . ",1
7700, Right . ,1
7701,"Every time when heroes came back from the battlefield , we took our hats off to them . ",1
7702, You were showing respect and admiration for them . ,1
7703, I wish I were a hero . ,1
7704,"Frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ? ",2
7705, Is he really ? ,2
7706," Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much . ",1
7707, Who is he marring ? ,2
7708," A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think . ",1
7709, Have they set a date for the wedding ? ,2
7710, Not yet . ,1
7711,"OK . Come back into the classroom , class . ",1
7712," Does the class start again , Mam ? ",2
7713," Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough . ",1

7717," Hurry up , little boy . ",1
7718,Do you have any hobbies ? ,2
7719," Yes , I like collecting things . ",1
7720," Oh , that ’ s interesting , and but what kind of things ? ",2
7721," Several things , for example , Very coins , stamps , stones and so on . ",1
7722, Stones ? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ? ,2
7723," Yes , stones . ",1
7724," well , I can ’ t just imagine it . ",1
7725,"Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ? ",2
7726, Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field . ,1
7727," Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth . ",1
7728,What a nice day ! ,1
7729, yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? ,3
7730," great , let's go ! ",4
7731," hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world . ",1
7732," exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... ",1
7733," yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies ! ",1
7734," why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant . ",3
7735, are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ? ,2
7736," never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ? ",3
7737," yeah , I think so . ",4
