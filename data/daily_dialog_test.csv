We've managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about 15 per cent in the last two years . ,1
 That's excellent . How have you managed that ? ,2
 Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system . ,1
 What does that mean exactly ? ,2
" Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers . ",1
 What other sources of energy do you use ? ,2
 We don't use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power . ,1

 I think I'll have a beer . ,1

 what would you do without me ? ,2
"This position demands a higher writing ability , so please say something about your writing ability . ",2

The Impact of Internet in Chinese Political Participation , The Discipline of Remold , The Historical Direction of Chinese Administration Reform , Bribery Cases of Self governance in Chinese Villages are respectively published in Chinese Publish Administration , Beijing Due Xuebao , Theory and Society and Chinese Reform . I joined in Yangzi Evening News to work as a part-time journalist in 2006 .

" It's nice to meet you , Mr . Cooper . ",1

" Yes , it was quite a long flight . I'm glad to finally be here . ",1
Can you help me now ? ,3

 Do you have any practical experience as a secretary ? ,2
" Yes , sir . I acted as a secretary in an insurance company . ",1
 Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ? ,3

" How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ? ",2
" It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up . ",1
 What are you going to do now ? ,2
" I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesn't know yet . I didn't tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought I went to work as usual . ",1
 That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ? ,2
" Yes , I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in . ",1
" Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand . ",3
" I just don't know how to bring it up . Well , all right . She has the right to know anyways . ",4

 That sounds absolutely fantastic . ,1
Good afternoon . Can I be of service ? ,2
 I don't know . Can I purchase Treasury Certificates here at this counter ? ,3
" Yes , of course . We have Treasury Notes with two , three and five-year terms available . ",4
" Two years is fine , with a value of 1,000 RIB . ",3
" OK , could I take a look at some ID please , like a passport ? ",3
" Here you go . By the way , is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up ? ",3
" No , I'm afraid that isn't possible . You must wait until maturity before you cash them . ",4
Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail ! ,2

" Yes , what can I do for you ? ",2
 I had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won ’ t be able to come to school today . ,3
 My goodness ! Are you OK ? ,2
" I broke my leg , but it is healing . ",1
 How long will you be out of class ? ,2
 I should be able to return by next Monday . ,1
" Fine . Well , thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent . I hope you feel better soon . ",1
Good afternoon ! Did you call for a plumber ? ,2
" Yes , yes I did . Please come in ! I ’ m so glad you came ! This old house is falling apart ! Come on into the bathroom . See , here , there ’ s water leaking everywhere ! ",3
" I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that ’ s not working either . I suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . That ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow . ",4
" Oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . She is always flushing things down the toilet . You know how kids are . ",1
" Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it ’ s urgent . ",1
 That would be great ! Is it expensive ? ,2
 Let ’ s see ... I would say about eight hundred dollars . ,1
"Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet . ",3
 I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ? ,2
 My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . ,1
 I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? ,2
" Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . ",1
 You need a babysitter . ,3
" Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . ",4
 I could have Suzy stay at my place . ,1
" I don't want to do that to you , Karen . ",1
 Why not ? ,2
 Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . ,1
" I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . ",1
" I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . ",1
 I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . ,1
 I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older . ,1
 I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . ,1
 Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free . ,3
Good evening . What'll you have ? ,2

" I hope we can do more business together . Though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . In the meantime , let's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance . ",3
"By the way miss , where is the toilet ? ",2

 It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? ! ,2
 I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ? ,2
" Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty . ",1
 That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much . ,1
 I have the same idea as yours . ,1
 It's OK . Please have a taste of it . ,3
" Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious . ",4
 Thank you for your praise . ,1

" Sir , we are terribly sorry for that.We will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room 3 hours later . Is that all right ? ",3
 That's fine . ,4
I'd like you to do me a favor . ,3

I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports . ,3
 It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight . ,1
 What about a draft at 120 days sight ? ,3
 All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us . ,3
 A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due . ,4
 Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible . ,3
 I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries . ,4
 So do I . ,1
"There's a new girl in school , have you seen her yet ? ",2

 The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes . ,1
 I think I might've bumped into her before . ,1
 Are you telling me that you've seen her before ? ,2
 I believe so . ,1

 Can I return the car in San Francisco ? ,3
" San Francisco ? No , sir.We only have this office here . You will have to return it here . ",4
 Really ? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities . ,2
" No , sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot . ",1
" Well , I guess I will have to drive back down then . Hmm . I didn't think of that . ",1
" Do you still want the car , sir ? ",2
 Yes . It will be fun . Driving back down the coast . My girlfriend will like it . ,1
 It's a beautiful drive . ,1
 Where are the keys ? ,2
" Just a moment , sir . We have to finish filling out the forms . ",1
Gary . Could you type up this report for me ? I have to take off early this afternoon . ,3
 Sure . Just leave it to me . I'll finish it . ,4
Look at the show on TV . I am watching a food show at a very famous seafood restaurant . I really want to eat at that restaurant . I am a seafood lover . ,1
" Speaking of seafood , my mouth is watering . Let's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood . ",3
 Sound great . Let's go ! ,4
 Look at the crystal clear fridge . You can see so many kinds of seafood in it . They all look very fresh and delicious . ,3
 True . I would like to have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head . ,4
 You sound like a seafood expert . I would like to have some stir-fried squids and steamed shrimps . ,1
 You are not too bad as well . I also want to have a steamed lobster . It is really taste like heaven . ,1
 Let's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food . ,3

You're made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual . ,1
 Where was it from ? ,2
 It was made in Jingdezhen . ,1
 Jingdezhen ? Isn't it called ' the capital of porcelain ' ? ,2
 You are right . ,1
 This is the very thing I've been dreaming of . ,1
 It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China . ,1
 It must be most precious . ,1

"I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ? ",2
 Alright . ,1
 It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . ,3
" Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital . ",3
 Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . ,4
" Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time . ",3
 It really hurts . ,4
" Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ? ",2
 To hell with you . The accident was your fault . ,1
" I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ? ",2
 To hell with you . ,1

 Hello . I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . What's on this weekend ? ,2
" Well , there will be charity performance on Saturday night . And also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night . ",1
 It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ? ,3
 Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless . ,4
 What about the performance itself ? ,2
" Oh , it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven . ",1
" Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite . ",1
 It surely is . And the cast is really the best . ,1
 Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ? ,2
" The price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back . ",1
All right . I want to bring everybody back on this subject . When can we start working on this ? ,2
" Well , we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00 . ",3
" I tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and I'll come by at around 3:00 ",4
 That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ? ,2
" Perhaps one year , I'm not sure . ",1
What dressing would you like on the salad ? ,2
" French dressing , please . ",1
 I beg your pardon ? ,2
" Oh , French dressing . ",1
" Sorry , it's not available now.Anything else ? ",2
 We still prefer French dressing . ,1

 Thank you . ,4
"Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ? ",3
" Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . ",3
" Yeah , that's very important . ",4
" So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . ",3
 I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . ,4
" That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . ",3
 It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . ,4
" It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . ",3
 But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . ,4
" I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . ",3
 It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . ,4
" You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . ",3
 I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . ,4
 You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . ,3
 It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . ,4
" It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . ",3
"The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? ",2
 No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . ,1
 It better be more than last year . ,1
" Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . ",1
"I'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed . ",3
 What a pity ! ,1
" If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ? ",3
 That's OK . ,4
"Good day ! Welcome to Lincoln Bank , how may we assist you ? ",2

 No problem . I'll be in touch as soon as it comes in . ,4
May I help you ? ,2
" Yes . I have to stay in your cry for just one day , can you suggest a short tour ? ",2

" That sounds fine , thanks for that . Let's go ahead ! ",3

" The developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . In some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . So I think the software industry has a great future . ",1
 Have you ever designed any programs concerning network ? ,2
" Yes , I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE . ",1
 Have you got anything to ask me ? ,2
" Yes , can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position ? ",2
" Yes , of course . You would be responsible for the development of software products . ",1
 I see . This is my advantage . ,1
 Good . Have you got any other questions ? ,2
 No . ,1
" Ok , I will contact you in a week . See you . ",3
" Thank you , bye-bye . ",4
"Tom , is Jenny crying ? ",2

 sure . What do you need ? ,2
" well , I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice . ",1
 really ? Why ? ,2
 it's complicated . But basically it boils down to one thing . This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go . ,1
 but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here ! ,1
" well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer . ",1

 I have no idea what the entertainment should be . ,1
 Let's make sure we are on the same page . Do we want a formal or informal gathering ? ,2
 Let's make it a formal affair . ,3
" Yes , that would be best . Now , for food should we have Chinese or American food ? ",2
 American food would be the best choice . ,3
" That would be great . What kind of music would you like , a band or recorded music ? ",2

" Sorry , but this is the best price . You can ’ t get it any cheaper than here . ",4
 I see . Can I pay by traveler ’ s checks ? ,3
 I'm afraid you can ’ t . You ’ re welcome to pay in cash . ,4
Do you have a free moment ? ,3
 Sure . What do you need ? ,3
 I'm having some trouble . How do you use this printer ? ,2
" Well , first you have to turn this switch on . ",3

 Where do I put the change ? ,2
" The quarters go into the slot . You have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on . ",1
 Is that everything that I have to do ? ,2
 That's all there is . ,1
 I appreciate you helping me with this . ,1
" If you need anything else , just let me know . ",3
Do you have any questions ? ,2
" Yes , do I have to work a whole year before I can take a vacation ? ",2

I am absolutely famished . ,1

 They have anything you want . ,1

"Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names . ",3
 That's OK . ,4
 The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective . ,1
" Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared . ",1
 Thank you . ,1
" Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time . ",3
 That's a good idea . ,4
" First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract . ",3
 Agreed . ,4
" For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments . ",3

"How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Diane . ",1
" How do you do , Jack . Nice to meet you . ",1
" Well , I think you ' Ve reconsidered our proposal , Diane . ",1
" Yes , you are right . After all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . The only problem is price . ",1
" I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable . ",2
" That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 . ",3
" That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount . ",3
" I see your point . That's to say s 611 each set . Still it's much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ? ",3
" Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ? ",3
 All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set . ,4
 Very well . Thank you . ,1
Don't I know you ? ,2
 I'm not sure.You look familiar . ,1

" If you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks . ",1
" But if I don't pass , will you call me ? ",2
" I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful . ",1
 Then do I have the chance to get this job ? ,2
" I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers . ",3
" I know . No matter what the result will be , I have learned a lot from our conversation . ",1
 Your mentality is very good and that's great . ,1
 Thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview . ,1

 Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up . ,1
 But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too . ,1
 I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight . ,1
 You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit . ,3
We are looking for a bilingual secretary . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ? ,2

 Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down . ,3
 But I can't just slow down . ,4
" You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones . That's too much for a man of your size . ",3
 You mean I've got to lose weight ? ,3
 Yes . You've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise . ,4
"You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ? ",2
 Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful . ,1
" So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ? ",2
" Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities . ",1
 Do you do the same exercises every day ? ,2
" No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park . ",1
 Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ? ,2
" It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them . ",1
" Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally . ",1

 I will go to bed early tonight . ,1
 Do you have an airsickness ? ,2

 You'd better bring some medicine for airsickness . ,3

Can we choose a time to look at houses together ? ,3
" Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ? ",2
 Either way is good for me . ,1
 There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . Would that okay with you ? ,2
" I can take a little time off of work , or I can go on a weekend , also . ",1
" We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home . ",2
" I am leaving from work , so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at . ",1

What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong . ,2
 What do you mean ? ,2
" Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way . ",1
"Mom , when you come home , please buy a coat , a skirt , a sweater ... ",3
 Enough is enough . I know . ,4

Have you ever tried shopping online ? ,2
" No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes . ",1
 That's right . Seeing is believing . ,1
" I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement . ",1

" What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password . ",1
" It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough . ",1

" Give me a break , Mr Yang . ",3
" Uh , let's keep this going , shall we ? ",4
"I'm sorry , but I don't think this damage is our fault . ",1
 What do you mean ? ,2

" Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . ",1
" Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ? ",2
" Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . ",1
 Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production ,1
" That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity !

They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! ",3
" Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... ",4
" Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . ",1
" Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? ",2
" I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . ",1
 Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ? ,2
" It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach . ",1
" Ah , get back to you . ",4
 Mr . Johnson ? Mr . Johnson ? ,2
Do you need a guide ? ,3
" Yes , we are just looking for one . What's the charge per day ? ",2
" It's $ 20 . If you are staying for more than 3 days in the city , the charge is $ 16 per day . ",1
 That's reasonable . ,4
Aren't you Jim Green ? ,2
" Yes , that's right . ",1

"Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ? ",3
" Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it . ",3
 I think I can handle it by myself . ,3
 I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . ,3
" I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . ",1
 Other company rules also need your attention . ,3

 You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ? ,2

" Yes , good luck , Maria . ",1

" well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ? ",2

" that's ok . I'll wait until you're finished . Just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ? ",2
 no . I don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile . ,1
 how much does the magadize cost ? ,2
" it's almost three pounds now , and I think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon . ",1
 that's quite expensive . Who is their target audience ? ,2
" Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore . ",1
" I bet you'll still buy it , though . You wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine ! ",1
Wei ! This is a first-you didn't bargain ! ,1
 Bargain ? I'd feel way too guilty . ,1
 But you could have saved money . ,1
" From a sweet ma ? ! It's not worth it . Plus , I'd happily pay more for these things I bought ! ",2
" F . Y . I . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done ... ",3
 Ha ! I'm just warming up ! Please take me there now ! ,4

" Yes . I ’ Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market . ",4
 That ’ s great ! I ’ m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ? ,2

 Did the cops show up in time ? ,2
 He didn't even make it out the door . ,1

 people are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder . ,1
 you mean if they catch the murderer . I ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night . ,1

 Good idea . ,4

"So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ... ",2
" No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . ",1
 How many people are on the board of directors ? ,2
" Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line . ",1
"How much will my pay be , if you don ’ t mind my asking ? ",2

 No problem . We'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room . ,4
"Mum , can I finish my homework later ? ",3
 Sorry . You know the rules . ,4
 But I want to watch TV now . ,3
 That ’ s out of the question . ,4
 Please . ,3
 Not a chance . ,4
 Not even for an hour ? ,3
" Sorry , it ’ s impossible . ",4
"Where ’ s Sally , Jack ? ",2
" She ’ s in the garden , Jane . ",1
 What ’ s she doing ? ,2
 She ’ s sitting under the tree . ,1
" Is Tim in the garden , too ? ",2
" Yes , he is . He ’ s climbing the tree . ",1
 I beg your pardon ? Who ’ s climbing the tree . ,2
 Tim is . ,1
 What about the dog ? ,2
" The dog ’ s in the garden , too . It ’ s running across the grass . It ’ s running after a cat . ",1
What's wrong with you ? ,2

" Unfortunately , I just can ’ t make it this time . I have to go straight home . It ’ s my second wedding anniversary , and we ’ re supposed to be having a big dinner Susan would kill me if I missed it . ",4
 Happy anniversary ! Sorry you won ’ t be there . Maybe some other time ? ,3
" Yeah , maybe . Thanks , anyway . Hope you guys have a great time ! ",4
Excuse me . Do you mind if I try this on ? ,3
 Not at all . The changing rooms are just this way . ,4
 Thanks . It's a little tight . Do you have any in a larger size ? ,2
" Sure . I'll give you the next size up . That one is small , right ? ",2
" Yes . Also , I'm not so sure about the color . ",1
 Well.It doesn't go with your skirt . I think the color itself is fine though . ,1
Are you going to vote ? ,2
 Of course ! Are you ? ,1
" I plan to , but what day is the election ? ",2
 You should know that . ,1
 Can you just tell me ? ,3
 The election is this Tuesday . ,1

 Whatever . Just make sure you go vote . ,1
"Dave , there's something I want to talk to you about . ",3

" OK , but don't tell anyone what I said . ",3
You get your bus pass ? ,2
 I'm not going to buy one . ,1
 You're not ? ,2
 I think it's a waste of money . ,1
 It actually costs less if you have a bus pass . ,1
 How is that ? ,2
 You can use it however many times you need to . ,1
 Is that right ? ,2
" Yup , and you can keep the money in your pocket . ",1
 That sounds nice . ,1
 You should go get yours . ,3
" Yeah , I think I will . ",4
Good morning . Craftsman Company . Can I help you ? ,2
" Yes , good morning . This is Mr . Suzuki from Video TV . May I speak to Mr . Johnson ? ",3
" I'm sorry , but Mr . Johnson is out at the moment . Can I take a message ? ",3
" Uh , yes , okay . Tell him John Suzuki called . That's S-U-Z-U-K-I . ",3
 Yes . ,4
 From Video TV . ,1
" Yes , Video TV . ",1
 Tell him I telephoned . I'd like to see him about the videotapes . Can he call me this afternoon ? ,3

 Let's line up . The steak is very inviting . I'll have it . ,1
 I'll have ham and egg with French fries . What dessert do you want ? ,2
 Banana pie . ,1
 Where shall we sit ? ,2
 How about there ? ,3
Do you like cooking ? ,2
 I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it.It gives me a real sense of satisfaction.Do you enjoy cooking ? ,2
" I don ’ t like it.It takes up too much time and I really hate having it clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away . ",1
 You can ask the guests for help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes . ,3
 So what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food . ,2
" Italian , Indian and chinese . I ’ Ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and I need some more practice . ",1
 Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ? ,2
" Not at all.You can find most of them in supermarkets.The ingredients are usually the same as in Western food.The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients . ",1
 How long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people ? ,2
" Obviously , it depends on what I ’ m cooking.But I ’ d say it generally takes about one and a half hours . ",1
I'm searching for an old music box . ,3
 You came to the right place . Any particular decade ? ,2
" If you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice . ",1
" We just got one in yesterday , so now we have six . ",1
 Would any of them have dancing figures ? ,2
" Yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures . ",1
" Oh , they're both so beautiful . Let me have this one , I think . ",3
" That one truly is a beautiful piece of work , isn't it ? ",2
 One last question ,1
" Oh , no . Everything we sell here is "" as is . "" ",1
 I guess I was asking for too much . ,1
" If it breaks down , maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet . ",1
We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet ! ,3
 Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy . or a kitty ! ,4
 Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ? ,2
" I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard ! ",1
" What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog . ",2
 Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ? ,3
" We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house . ",4
 Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome ! ,3
" I ’ ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there . ",4
 Yay ! ,1
Over here is our gym . We have all the latest equipment . ,1
 But I haven't used exercising equipment before . Can you tell us some more details ? ,3
" Certainly . We have here the race apparatus , stationary bike , muscle builder set , chest expander , bar bell , dumb bell and so on . ",4
 Working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight . What else do you have ? ,2
 Here's the swimming pool . It's open from 10 a . m . to 11 p . m . There are also massage rooms here . ,1
 That's wonderful ! I like swimming . ,1
"John , I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year . ",3
" I've already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska . ",3
 You can't be serious ! ,1
" Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you . ",1
" After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together . ",3
 Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case . ,4
" You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all ! ",3
 Whatever you say ! ,4
Have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax ? ,2
 Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ? ,1
 I don't really know . Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . He can even help you avoid paying tax legally . ,3
" If I don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ? ",2
" Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection.They ' ll check your income through computers . You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined . ",1
What's up ? You sound a little down in dumps . ,2
 I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn . ,1
 Calm down ! Shouting won ’ t help ? ,2
 He is really outrageous . ,1
 What happened ? ,2
" I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me . ",1
 What ? He can't do this to you . ,1
" Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know . ",1
 What did you do ? ,2
 I shouted it back of course . ,1
" Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ? ",3
 What would you do if you were in my shoes ? ,2
" Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him . ",1
" No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault . ",4
" I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate . ",1
 I am too angry to do that . ,1
"Excuse me . I am looking for a book called Little Women , but I can't find it anywhere . ",3
 Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out . ,4

 Of course . You completely forgot it . ,1
 Darling . I think you have made a mistake . ,1
 I have made a mistake ? ,2
 Yes . We married on July 20 ten years ago . ,1
 July 20 ? But I think it should be June 20 . ,1
" Yes . We had planned to marry on June 20 , but something happened , so we had to put off our wedding day . ",1
 Yes . I remember now . We put it off . I did make a mistake . But how shall we deal with the tickets ? ,3
 Since you have booked . Then let ’ s celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand . ,4
Do you want some dessert ? ,2
" No , thank you . Check , please . ",1
 Wait a moment . I will calculate it for you . Your bill comes to $ 36 . ,1
 Here are $ 40 . Keep the change . That's my tip for you . ,3
"Food is less expensive in a cafeteria , because you serve yourself . ",1
 How to do it ? ,2
" Just pick up a tray , then put a knife , a fork , a spoon and a paper napkin on it and stand in the line . ",1
 How long will it take to reach the buffet ? ,2
" Not long , because people rush for lunch . ",1
 The line sure does move fast . ,1
 Tell the man behind the counter what you want . ,3
 OK . I like that green vegetable but I don't know how to call it . ,4
 Just point to it if you don't know the name . ,3
 All right . ,4
"Hey , did you hear about Jessica's party this weekend ? ",2
" Yeah , but I'm still waiting for my invitation . ",1
 Oh really ? She gave me mine earlier today . ,1
" Well , she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today . ",1
" Yeah , so are you planning on going ? ",2
 I think so . It sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun . ,1
" It really does , I can't wait . ",1
 What time does the party start ? ,2
 It starts at 8 o'clock . ,1
" Oh , well , how many people has she given invites to so far ? ",2
" I'm not sure , but I don't think she's given out that many . ",1
" Well , hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today . ",1
"After the financial crisis , many industries are in incredibly cloudy situations . How do you think about our company ? ",2
 The outlook in the future is very positive . Because we have been in this field for hundreds of years and we know how to survive this crisis safely . ,1
" As the department I am applying for is expanding , I would like to contribute by effort . ",3
 Great . Welcome to our company . ,4
Farmer's Pet Store . ,1
 Can you please tell me where you are located ? ,2
" Sure , we are off Singing Road , close to the bank . ",1
" Thank you , I know where that is . ",1
"Hi , Bob , this is John Lin . ",1
" Hello , John . ",1
 I'm with Hartford public relations . I'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services . ,3
 How about tomorrow at 11 o'clock ? ,3
"Hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ? ",2
" Oh , don't mention it . It was terrible . ",1
 What ' the matter ? ,2
" The food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone . ",1
 I see . You simply can't blame the server for this . ,1
" Yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district . ",1
 That's true . ,1
" Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ? ",2
 It was good . I brought lunch from home today . ,1
 You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America . ,2
" Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy . ",1
" I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat . ",1
" Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ? ",2
 You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America . ,1
" Well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places . ",1
 Seriously ? ,2
" Yeah , it's hard to believe but true . ",1
Have you seen this news article ? Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online . ,2
" Wow , that's really interesting . So who won ? ",2
" Well , the Great Wall of China , the Taj Mahal in India . ",1
" I've been there ! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art . The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds ! ",1
" Cool ! Also amongst the winners is Petra , in Jordan , Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico . ",1
" Wait a minute ! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders . I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator ! ",1
" Well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year . ",3
 Good idea ! ,4
"Hello , I'd like to reserve a hotel room . ",3

 My name is John Sandals . ,1
" Hello , Mr . Sandals . My name is Michelle . What days do you need that reservation , sir ? ",2
" I'm planning to visit New York from Friday , April 14 until Monday , April 17 . ",1
" Our room rates recently went up . Is that okay with you , Mr . Sandals ? ",3
 How much per night are we talking about ? ,2
 Each night will be $ 308 . ,1
 That price is perfectly acceptable . ,4
 Wonderful ! Do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room ? ,2
" Nonsmoking , please . ",3
" Next question , Is a queen-size bed okay ? ",3
 That sounds fine . ,4
" Okay , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is in our computer . All we need now is a phone number . ",3
 Certainly . My phone number is 626-555-1739 . ,1
" Thank you , Mr . Sandals . We look forward to seeing you in New York ! ",1
"Good evening , Pizza House . This is Marty speaking.May I take your order ? ",3
" Um yes . I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni , olives , and extra cheese . ",3
 We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas.Would you like a large pizza instead ? ,2
" Sure , that sounds good . ",1
 Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ? ,2
" No , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . Oh , and make it thin crust . ",1

"Hello , Personal Banking . How may I help you ? ",2
" Hi there . I'm calling about Personal Internet Banking , what details can you give me ? ",3

We offer an online payment service , Personal Net Banking , which includes services such as account transfers , personal foreign exchange trading . You can also get account management services , online bill payment , for household bills like gas and electricity ... ",1
 That sounds good . At the moment I spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills . ,1
I was surprised to see how few people you have on-site . You provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce . ,1
" It depends on the time of year . At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . We also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . We run a very tight operation ! ",1
 Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ? ,2
 Sometimes we use a local employment agency . It depends on the job . ,1
"Jeff , look at this listing ! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . What do you think ? ",2
 Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ? ,2
" Hmm ... let me look . Yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building . ",1
" That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ? ",2
 It says it's located in the suburbs . ,1
What would you like to have for dinner ? Chicken or beef ? ,2
" Chicken , please . ",3
 Good choice ! ,4

 Anything else ? ,2
 I would like to have some tea as well . ,3
 Another flight attendant is coming down the aisle with coffee and tea . ,1
 I see . ,1
I'd like to apply for a credit card . Can you help me with my application ? ,3
 I'd be glad to . ,4
 I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history . I just came to this country . ,1
 Do you have an account with this bank ? ,2
 I'm afraid not . ,1
 In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . That would help with your credit card application . ,3
 What is the interest rate on your card ? ,2
 The annual charge rate is 9.5 % . ,1
 That's very expensive ! ,1
 Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe . ,1
 How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ? ,2
 You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized . ,1
 Does the card provide any other benefits ? ,2
" You can also get a cash advance up to 1,000 dollars on this card . ",1
"You're really fit , Paul . Do you exercise very much ? ",2
" Well , I almost always get up very early , and I lift weights for an hour . ",1
 You're kidding ! ,1
 No . And then I often go Rollerblading . ,1
 Wow ! How often do you exercise like that ? ,2
 About five times a week . What about you ? ,2
" Oh , I hardly ever exercise . I usually just watch TV in my free time . I guess I'm a real couch potato ! ",1
I don't believe we've met . ,2
" No , I don't think we have . ",1
 My name is Gao Run . ,1
 How do you do ? My name is James Green . ,1
 Here's my name card . ,3
 And here's mine . ,3
 It's nice to finally meet you . ,1
" And I'm glad to meet you , too . ",1
Marketing Manager ’ s Office . Can I help you ? ,2
" Mr . Smith , please . ",3
" Sorry , he is out . ",4
 What time do you expect him back then ? ,2

" No , thanks . I will call back later . ",4
 That ’ s fine . Please call again later . ,3
 OK . Thank you . Goodbye . ,4
Can I help you ? ,2
" Yes , I need some traveler's checks . ",3
 How much do you need ? ,2
 Three thousand US dollars . ,1
" All right , can I have your passbook ? ",3
" Yes , here you go . ",4
 What amounts do you want the checks in ? ,2
 It's all the same to me . ,1
 Here you are . ,1
 Thanks . ,1
The plumbing in my new apartment is not working . ,1
 I need you to tell me what the problem is . ,3
 The bathroom sink is stopped up . ,1
" Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also , or just the bathroom plumbing ? ",2
 Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem . ,1
" Did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ? ",2
 Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago . ,1
 Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem ? ,3
 I am not sure if I will be home later . ,4
" I will be coming by around 10 this morning . If you aren ’ t there , I ’ ll just use my key . ",3
Grand Theft Auto Three is awesome ! ,1
 It's more violent than TV news ! ,1
 What time is it anyway ? ,2
 Nine-thirty . ,1
" Oh , my God , three hours already ! I have to get the chores done ! ",1
 No time . That's their headlights in the window ! ,1
" OK , emergency measures . Let's throw the dishes in the trash ! Two birds with one stone ... ",3
" Little dude , your life is over ! ",4
 No time to worry . We have to dispose of this evidence . ,3
How old is Keith ? ,2
 He's 21 . How old is James ? ,1
" He's a year older than Keith , but he looks younger . ",1
 How's your father ? ,2
 He's fine . He retired last week . It's a turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . ,1
 He can spend more time with his grandchildren . ,1
" Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world . ",1
" So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea ! ",1
 How do you want to spend your old age ? ,2
" In the same way , probably . ",1
Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ? ,3
" Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume . ",3
 But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ? ,4
" Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume . ",3
" It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ? ",2
" Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer . ",1
Why not come over to work in my company ? ,3
 I need to think it over . ,4
 Tell me what you need . ,3
" All right . I'm prepared to , if the pay is reasonable . ",4
We are approaching the top of the mountain . ,1
 What a beautiful view we have here . ,1
" Yes , you can have a bird's-eye view of the whole city . ",1
 Wonderful . Will we have any free time there ? ,2
 Of course . We will stay there for half an hour and you can do your own business . ,1
what did you do last night ? ,2
 I just stayed at home and watched TV . ,1
 did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ? ,2
" yes , it was a very evenly matched game . ",1
 what were the results of the game ? ,2
 it ended in a tie . ,1
 what was the actual score ? ,2
 it was three all . ,1
 really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid . ,1
" if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . ",1
 what happened ? ,2
" their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway . ",1
 that explains it . ,1
 how many more games are left this season ? ,2
 that was the last game before the playoffs . ,1
 when do the playoffs start ? ,2
 in a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ? ,2
 of course ! I really love watching football games on TV . ,1
" Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . ",3
" sure , that would be great . ",4
" Ok , it's a date then ! ",1
how are you ? ,2
" I ’ m fine , thanks . Just trying to get adjusted . It ’ s hard to keep track of everything around here . ",1
" That ’ s for sure . You ’ re new , too , huh ? ",2
 Yeah . I just got here a couple of days ago . How about you ? ,2
"Excuse me . I bought this shirt yesterday , but I would like to refund it . ",3
" Gave me the receipt , please . ",3
 Here is my receipt . ,4
 What's wrong with it ? ,2
 It's too small for me to wear . ,1
 Would you like another bigger one ? ,2
 No thanks . I want to have a refund . ,1
" OK , here is your money . ",1
"Oh , so many kinds of winter hats . ",1
" What is your favorite color , miss ? ",2
 Red . ,1
 Here you are.It ' s very attractive . ,1
 May I try it on ? ,3
 Go ahead . ,4
 Is there a mirror around here ? ,2
 Right over there . ,1
 Does it suit me ? ,2
" Yes , you look very nice . ",1
 How much is it ? ,2
 We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax . ,1
 That's quite reasonable . ,1
What can I help you with ? ,2
 May I ask you something ? ,3
 What's your question ? ,2
 How many hours behind the wheel do I need ? ,2
 What do you need to take it for ? ,2
 I'm trying to get my license . ,1
 You need six hours . ,1
 Can I do all six hours in one day ? ,3
 You have to do it in three days . ,4
 That's all I have to do ? ,2
 That's everything . ,1
" Well , that's a relief . ",1
"Excuse me , I have something to trouble you . ",3
 Yes ? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you . ,4
" An hour ago , I bought this vase with my tourist . ",1
" Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ? ",2
 I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel . ,1
" Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ? ",3
" Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes . ",4
 It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ? ,3
 All right . Thank you . ,4
" Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully . ",3
" Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one . ",4
 I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you . ,1
" Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing . ",1
Here you are . You left the medicine here . ,1
 Sorry . I was too worried . ,1
 I firmly believe that you love your brother very much . ,1
" Absolutely . By the way , do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine ? ",2
" Yes , we have some Chinese medicine for common cold . ",1
 I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure . ,1
 It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention . ,3
What kind of place shall we rent ? ,2
" It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up . ",1
 Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat . ,1
" Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ? ",2
" I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home . ",1
" Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us . ",3
" Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early . ",4
 How much do you think the rent will be ? ,2
 I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month . ,1
I have a terrible toothache . ,1
 Which tooth is it ? ,2
 This one here . ,3
" Ar , Yes . There ’ s a big cavity . ",1
 Can you fill it ? ,2
 I ’ m afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out . ,3
 Then I might as well have it done now . ,4
" you ’ d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days . ",3
"May I have a look at that vase , please ? ",3
 Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan . ,4
" Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive . ",1
 Really ? Even for such an excellent one ? ,2
Can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment ? ,3
 The local newspaper has ads for housing . ,4
 Is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ? ,2
 Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate . ,1
 What do landlords charge for rent ? ,2
" Would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ? ",2
" There are two of us , but we only need a one-bedroom apartment . ",1
 You should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month . ,1
 I really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me . ,3
" Sure , I ’ ll go look at apartments with you anytime you want . ",4
"Excuse me , would you please do me a favor ? ",3
 With pleasure . ,4
 I appreciate the building so much . I am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building . ,3
 No problem . ,4
The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge . ,1
" Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford . ",1
 Why is the price so high ? ,2
" It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly . ",1
 Model of computers aren't compatible ? ,2
 Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities . ,1
" Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable . ",1
" But by then , the technology will be outdated . ",1
" True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge . ",1
" That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable . ",1
" This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product . ",1
 I guess you get what you pay for . ,1
What kind of permanent would you like to have ? ,2
 what kinds do you have ? ,2
" Oh , yeah , It ’ s quite of variety . Regular , cold perm , straight perm , pink curl and form . ",1
" Last time I tried a pink curl perm and form permanent . Set the wave a little loose than as usual , please . ",3
Hello ! How do I get more amenities ? ,3
" I'm sorry , sir . I'm not sure I understand . ",4
" I'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo . ",1
" Oh , I see . So , you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities . ",1
" No , no . I've got plenty left . ",1
 Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ? ,2
 What am I going to do about souvenirs ? ,1
" Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs ! ",1
" Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs . ",1
" Sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount . ",3
 Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs . ,4
" I understand completely , sir . Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment . ",4
Excuse me . Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ? ,2
" Well , you can take the No . 36 bus from here , but then you have to walk about 30 minutes . ",1
 That doesn't sound too bad . ,1
" Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo . ",1
 Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot . ,1
 You're welcome . ,1
"I'd like to order breakfast , please . ",3
" What'd you like , madam ? ",2
 Two muffins and a cup of coffee.Will it take long ? ,2
" No , just a few minutes . ",1
How are you ? ,2
 I ’ m doing well . ,1
 How may I help you ? ,2
 Could you cancel a check for me ? ,3
 What ’ s the problem ? ,2
 I wrote the check out for way too much . ,1
 How much ? ,2
 I wrote the check out for $ 150 . ,1
 What were you supposed to write it out for ? ,2
 I was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 . ,1
 I ’ ll just cancel it for you right now . ,4
 That ’ s great . You ’ re a lifesaver . ,1
"Would you like to take a look at the menu , sir ? ",3
 Yes . Thank you . ,4
 Would you care for a drink before you order ? ,3
 A glass of Qingdao beer . ,3
" Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ? ",4
 Will you make some recommendation ? ,3
"I ’ m taking BA fright 123 to London . Can you tell me where the reporting desk is , please ? ",3
" Yes , Madam . The reporting desk for the British Airway's flight to London is over there . ",1
 Thank you so much . Is this the desk for BA flight 123 to London ? ,2
" Yes , this is the right desk . Have you any luggage ? ",1
" The suitcase , that ’ s all . Except my handbag . Of course . ",1
 Would you please put you suitcase on the scales ? You needn ’ t weigh your handbag . ,3
 Is there a receipt ? ,2
 Yes . I ’ ll attach your baggage receipt to your ticket . ,1
 What must I do next ? ,3
 You must go to immigration to the departure lounge . ,4
It's time for bed . ,1
" But I'm not sleepy , Mum . Can I stay and watch more TV ? ",3
" It's already half past eleven . You have school tomorrow . You'll sleepy all tomorrow , if you don't sleep well tonight . ",3
 I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard . ,4
 Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those . ,2
" Oh , I nearly forgot the exams . ",1
" You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ? ",2
" Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow . ",1
 An excellent idea . Work now and play later . ,3
" I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed . ",3
" No , now it's bedtime . ",4
"Yes , madam ? Can I help you ? ",2
" Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ? ",2
" Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes . ",1
 I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week . ,1
" Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ? ",2
" Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ? ",2
 That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ? ,2
" Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them . ",1
" I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans . ",1
" I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday . ",1
" Well , it's all new stock in the window now . ",1
" May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ? ",3
" Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing . ",4
" Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ’ d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot . ",1
" Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price . ",3
" Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color . ",4
" That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ’ s exactly what you are looking for . ",1
" There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones . ",1
I've come to hear about your offer . ,3
" We have the offer ready for you . Let me check . 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box , at 20,000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box , at 30,000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box , at 7 , 500 yuan , for shipment in June . The offer is valid for five days . ",1
 I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected . ,3
 You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where . ,4
 I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies . ,3
" But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with . ",4
 I agree that yours are of the top . ,1
" Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ? ",2
" To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help . ",3
 Impossible . How about 5 % off ? ,3
 Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable . ,4
So I'm on the fifth floor ? How come this hotel has no fourth floor . ,2
" Four is an unlucky number here , Peter.Four sounds like death in Chinese.Hotels often have no fourth floor . ",1
" I see.Oh , I know what I wanted to ask.How much should I tip this guy ? ",2
" People don't usually tip here , but you can.Fifty dollars should be more enough . ",3

 It will be $ 850 . ,1
 Very good . Could I get an electronic ticket ? I ’ m always afraid of losing my tickets . ,3

 Bank of American card . The number is 6786 9182 12300 8657 . ,1
 Thank you ! Would you like an aisle seat or a window seat ? ,2

 What time should I arrive at Detroit Airport ? ,2

 What happens if I can ’ t leave on April 13 ? Can I cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date ? ,2
" Yes , you can , but you will have to pay a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation . ",1
 That ’ s OK . What are the weight restrictions for checked baggage ? ,2
" On Trans Pacific international flights , each ticketed passenger is permitted a maximum of two checked bags with a maximum weight per checked bag of 70 pounds . ",1
 That ’ s great ! I can have two bags checked for 70 pounds each . I think I ’ m all set . You ’ re really efficient . Thank you very much for your help . ,1

 Let ’ s put it down for 1:15 on Thursday . We ’ ll definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . ,3
 Fine . I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on Thursday . ,4
That looks graceful on you . ,1
 Thank you.But it is too bright for me . ,1
 How about this brown one ? ,3
 Let me try it on . I like that color . ,3
" Ok , i will get one for your.Here you are . ",4
 But it is too loose.Do you have the smaller size ? ,2

"Welcome . What can I do for you , Madam ? ",2
" I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ? ",3
" That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service . ",3
 A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ? ,2
" A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle . ",1
" But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you . ",2
" We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies . ",1
" I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free . ",4
Hello . ,1
 Hi . It ’ s Tony calling from the dentist ’ s office . Is Lily there ? ,2
" No , Lily is not here at the moment . ",1

 You ’ re welcome . Bye . ,1
 Bye . ,1
So what do you think of my new dress ? ,2
" I think it's great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now , but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment . ",1
" Um , ninety-five dollars ? ",2
" Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ? ",2
 I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else . ,1
" Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ? ",2
" I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive . ",1
Who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ? ,2
 I did . Why ? ,2
 Didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ? ,2
" No , I didn't . I'm sorry . It won't happen again . ",1
Is it Fred's fault ? ,2
" No , I don't suppose he's to blame.The man in the other car made a mistake . ",1
 But he's equally responsible because he tried to overtake you . ,1
"In foreign trade , exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner . ",1
 How to adjust ? ,2
" Exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs , wants and likes . ",1
" Ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas . ",1
" That's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably . ",1
" Yes , sometimes the differences are great . ",1
" Well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product . ",1
 We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales . ,1
I hate doing the damn laundry . ,1
 Watch your language . ,3
I want to buy three tickets . What's the entrance fee ? ,2

 Thanks a lot . ,1
Shall we share a taxi ? ,3
 Where are you heading now ? ,2
 I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road.It is very close to your house . ,1
 Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ? ,2
 That's the one . ,1
 You mean we'll share the taxi ? ,2
" Yeah.If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper.Besides that your Chinese is better than mine.The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully . ",1
" Well.Don ' t worry about it , I will be happy to share the taxi with you . ",1
Good morning.Are you Mr.Liu ? ,2
 My name is Liu Lichi . How do you do ? ,2
" How do you do ? Please be seated , How is your trip here ? ",2
" Quite good , I think . I came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes . ",1
" Oh , yes.How old are you ? ",2
 Twenty . ,1
" Hum , still a student ? ",2
" Yes , I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics . ",1
 What subjects are you studying ? ,2
" English , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy . ",1

 What do you like to do in your spare time ? ,2
" I like sports very much.Besides that , I also like working on a computer in my spare time . ",1
 How are your English and computer skills ? ,2
 I have passed the CET - 4 and 6.As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing . ,1
" Okay . Mr.Liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week . ",3
That dress is very pretty . Why don ’ t you like it ? ,2
 It ’ s too loud . ,1
 We ’ Ve been looking around for many hours.What on earth are you looking for ? ,2
" Well , you know , those styles or colors don ’ t suit me . ",1
 What style do you want ? ,2
" I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight . ",1
" Oh , I see.How about the color ? ",2
 Quiet color . ,1
 I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters . ,3
 Really ? Let ’ s go there . ,4
"Hey Julie , you want to go grab something to eat ? ",2
 Sure ! What do you feel like having ? ,2
 I really feel like having a big juicy steak ! ,1
" Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ? ",2
 I didn't know you were a vegetarian ! ,1
" I'm not , I am a vegan . ",1
 A what ? ,2
" A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood . ",1
 Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough ! ,1
" It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult . ",1
How do you feel about that restaurant ? ,2
 It wasn't all that great . ,1
 What did you dislike the most ? ,2
 I don't think that they had their act together . They didn't seem well prepared . ,1
 Did you think that the food was any good ? ,2
 I wasn't all that impressed by the food . ,1
 The service certainly could have been better . ,1
 The service did not help the situation . ,1
 Is this a restaurant that you want to come back to ? ,2
 I am not interested in trying this restaurant again . ,1
Let me see your passport . Is London your final destination ? ,2

 What are these ? ,2
 They are my personal effects . ,1
"I heard that you finished my home inspection , and I was wondering how it went . ",2
" First of all , we need to understand what I was looking for . Do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ? ",2
 I am not sure what a home inspection is all about . ,1
" I went there to check for problems with the home , so you aren ’ t surprised when you move in . ",1
 Wouldn ’ t the owners have told me about any problems ? ,2
" Sellers aren ’ t always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren ’ t aware of . ",1
 Can I require the owners to fix the problems ? ,3
 You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems . ,4
 What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ? ,2
 There were no major problems . One leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that I found . ,1
How you celebrate your Valentine ’ s Day with your wife ? ,2
 I will take a rain check . ,1

 About 50 miles . ,1

 I'm happy with that price . ,1
 Let's shake on it . ,3
" Okay , let's shake on it . ",4
May I help you ? ,2
" Give me a Big Mac , a small order of French fries and a medium Coke . ",1
 You'll need to wait a few minutes for the fries . They are still in the fryer . ,3
 That's fine . ,4
 Your total comes to $ 7 . ,1
 Here's a twenty . Could you give me some more napkins ? ,3
 Sure . Your cash back is $ 13 . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes . ,4

 Really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work . ,2
 It's important to do proper exercises . ,1
 You're right . Too much or too little won't do any good . ,1
" The trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet . ",1
 Sounds reasonable . ,1
 We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic . ,1
 And fruits ! ,1
 Surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness . ,1
 I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ? ,2

" Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over . ",1
 I've studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ? ,3
 Go right ahead . ,4
" Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room ",3

 Your check will arrive a little late . ,1

 Three-but there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions . ,1
 Like what ? ,2
" Oh , he wanted to know what time I got up this morning and if I bad a bath or a shower you know , things like that . ",1
 What on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing ? ,2
" I've no idea . Oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . He asked me what I had for breakfast this morning . ",1
" Oh well , that's it . They obviously think you're a desperate criminal and you have to steal to eat . I should think you'll get thirty years . ",1
 Hmm . Thank you very much . ,1

"I need a taxi , please . ",3
 We have various transportation services . Would you prefer a private vehicle ? ,3
" No , thanks . A taxi is just fine . ",4
 May I suggest a limo ? It's nice to pamper yourself . ,3
" I don't want anything except a taxi , thank you . ",4
 I understand . And where will you be going ? ,2
 Rockefeller Center . ,1
 And what time would you like to be picked up ? ,2
 The sooner the better . ,1
" A taxi will be here shortly , sir . ",1
" Great ! And remember , a taxi , not a limo . ",1
" A taxi it is , sir . ",1
"It's your turn now , Helen . ",3
 OK . I'm coming . ,4
 This is your song . I picked it for you . ,1
 Thank you . You are so considerate . ,1
 Push the red button on the mike to turn it on . ,3

 I think it's a piece of cake for you . ,1
 OK . Let me have a try ... ,1
 Well done ! I hope I can sing as well as you one day . ,1
 Thank you . I'm sure you will . ,1
 I hope so . Thank you for saying so . ,1
"Excuse me , could you help me pick out a lotion ? ",3
" Sure , what is the problem ? ",2
" I got poison oak while hiking , and I need something to help me with the itching . ",3
 I can suggest a product called Techne that comes in a lotion or cream . ,3
 Which do you prefer ? ,2
 Hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer . ,3
 Is there anything else I can do to help with the itching ? ,2
 You can take an antihistamine . ,3

 I ran into it a couple of weeks ago . What do you know ? Name's Hal . ,2
" I'm Akimbo . Nice to meet you , I guess . ",1
" Boy , I'm sure sorry about your car . Hey , Akimbo , I wonder if you'd like to make a deal ? ",2
 What kind of deal ? ,2
 I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car . ,1
 You don't want your insurance company to pay for it ? ,2
 I'd rather not . They'll raise my rates . It'll cost me more in the long run . ,1
" If you give me cash , do you care if I don't fix the car ? ",2
" Hell , I don't care . Just don'T submit a report to your insurancecompany . ",3

" Sorry , sir . It's the sale price . ",4
" Well , what about $ 70 with a scarf ? ",3
 It's my rock bottom price . Take it or leave it . ,4
"Good afternoon , sir . Have you made a reservation ? ",2

 I don't think so . You have to wait for about 10 minutes . ,3
 That's all right . ,4
I am calling to consult you about the job as a copywriter . ,3

 Let me help you . ,1
We have made some adjustment on the prices . And this is renewed price list . ,3
" Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side . ",4
" This is our rock-bottom price , and we can't make any further reduction . ",3
" If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks . ",4
 Then what ’ s your counter-offer ? ,2
 This is our counter-offer . ,1
" We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great . ",3
 So are we . Our counter-offer is in line with the world market . ,3
 How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ? ,3
 Agreed . ,4
What do you usually have for breakfast ? Pancakes or waffles ? ,2
 I usually have cereal for breakfast . ,1
 But isn't it served with cold milk ? ,2
 Yeah . Cold milk wakes me up . ,1
 Chinese people don't like to eat cold food . ,1
 Is that right ? ,2
" But I'm open to new things . I'll have a bowl of cereal , too . ",1
 With cold milk ? ,2
 With cold milk ! ,1
I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season . ,1
" That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . ",1
 It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ? ,2
" That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it . ",1
 Certainly . ,1
"Hi , I need to copy something right now . ",3
" Our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine , sir . ",1
 Great ! How much per copy ? ,2
" Sir , one copy is ten cents . ",1
" Okay , I'll be down there shortly . ",1
" You probably won't have to wait for anyone , sir . ",1
"Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific ! ",1
" Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that . ",1
" No , we just don ’ t usually admit it ! ",1
" Well , thanks for the compliment anyway ! ",1
This Olympic park is so big ! ,1
" Yes . Now we are in the Olympic stadium , the center of this park . ",1
 Splendid ! When is it gonna be finished ? ,2
 The whole stadium is to be finished this June . ,1
 How many seats are there in the stand ? ,2
" Oh , there are 5000 seats in total . ",1
 I didn ’ t know it would be so big ! ,1
" It is ! Look there , those are the tracks . And the jumping pit is over there . ",1
" Ah ... I see . Hey , look the sign here , No climbing . ",1
 We put many signs with English translations for foreign visitors . ,1
"It's located in the suburbs ? Well even though that sounds like a steal , I really want something downtown . ",1
 OK . Well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive . ,1
" I know , that's my problem . What do you think I should do ? ",2
" Well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate . ",1
" Oh , great idea ! ",1
"So , Monica , how do you like your new office ? ",2
" Well , I love it . The room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place ! ",1
 That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful . ,1
 What was so bad about it ? ,2
" Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work . ",1
 Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently . ,1
" Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor . ",3
"Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ? ",2
" Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 . ",1
" Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction . ",1
" Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically . ",1
" Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ? ",2
" Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student magazine , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York . ",1
 What did that involve ? ,2
" Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . ",1
" I ’ m sure . Okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ? ",3
" Yes , okay . ",4
"Could you change these for me , please ? ",3
 What would you like ? ,2
" Twenties and some smaller bills , please . ",3
 Anything else ? ,2
 Yes . Could you tell many balance ? Here's account number . ,3
"Now , what seems to be the trouble ? ",2
" It's nothing serious . But I always have a headache , and I haven't slept properly for several weeks . I've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning . ",1
" Mm , you do look rather pale . Let me take your temperature . Would you put the thermometer under your arm , please ? Now , let me listen to your pulse . Mm , do you feel weak ? ",2
" Yes , I never seem to have any energy . ",1
 I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest . ,3
 Thank you . ,4
"Excuse me , I would like to know something about this campus . Right now it seems very big and confusing ! I have no idea where I am going or what I am doing . ",3
 Do you have a map of the campus ? ,2
" Yes , I have , but it doesn ’ t help me very much . I ’ m not very good at reading maps . ",1
 Do you know where your classes are ? ,2
" More or less . I go to three different buildings , and always get there late . I feel so hopeless . I don ’ t know why I am late all the time . No one else seems to be . ",1
 That's because you don't know the short cuts . You'll learn them after a while . I can show you the ropes . ,4
"Good morning , I would like to reserve a berth . ",3
 Which train do you like ? ,2
 T112 to Washington please . ,1
 May I have your name ? ,3
 That's Lincoln . ,4
Will you be voting ? ,2
 I can ’ t wait to vote . ,1
 Who are you voting for ? ,2
 The person I ’ m voting for is the best . ,1
 What do you like about him ? ,2
 He is very intelligent . ,1
 You think so ? ,2
" That ’ s right . Plus , I agree with his policies . ",1
 I ’ m glad to hear that you are so excited . ,1
 I ’ m voting for the next President . ,1
 I ’ m sure he will be . ,1
 I ’ m going to make sure and vote . ,1
Good morning . May I help you ? ,2

What type of people do you work with most effectively ? ,2
" I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive . ",1
 What things impress you in your colleagues ? ,2
 I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment . ,1
 What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ? ,2
" The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior . ",1
 How do you organize and plan for major projects ? ,2
" I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react . ",1
 Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure . ,3
" I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed . ",1
 How do you manage your time in a typical day ? ,2
" I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week . ",1
 Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion . ,3
 I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings . ,1
"Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ? ",2
" Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth ! ",1
 I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better . ,1
 Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards . ,1
 It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case . ,1
I am sorry to have kept all of you waiting . I was delayed by something urgent . ,1
" You are not late , Mr . Thomas . There're still 15 minutes to go . Mr . White has just called you . ",1
 What did he say ? ,2
" He said there was a traffic jam , but he is coming . ",1
 He shouldn't drive his car . He should come here by bus . ,1
Want to send out for some Chinese ? ,2
 Some what ? ,2
" Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat . ",1
" No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ? ",3
" Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like . ",4
 Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ? ,2
" Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered . ",1
 What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste . ,2
 Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag . ,1
Do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ? ,2
 I know something about it . Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills . ,1
" It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so I can not bear it anymore . It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills . ",1
 Is that true ? ,2
 Definitely ! ,1
" If that information is exact , I guess our company is willing to promote someone . ",1
"Hello sir , how may I help you ? ",2
" I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice . ",3
" I see , may I ask what the occasion is ? ",3
" It ’ s not really an occasion , it ’ s more like I ’ m sorry . ",4
 Very well.This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness . ,3
 I think I ’ m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ? ,4
" Mmm , well this is our I ’ m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you . ",3
 I don ’ t think that ’ s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better ! ,4
" I ’ m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ? ",2
" Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier . ",1
" Get out of my store , you jerk ! ",3
I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ? ,2
" I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel . ",1
 You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ? ,2
 I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here . ,1
" Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well . ",1
" Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list . ",1
 How many people are on the waiting list right now ? ,2
 Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 . ,1
How do you think they could be ended ? ,2
 I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . ,1
" So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources , share them . ",1
" It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it's harder to make peace between countries . ",1
" Yes , it is.One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . ",1
You still have not given me those files I ’ Ve asked you for . ,3
" I ’ m sorry , Mr . Myers . I ’ Ve just been so busy today . ",4
" I really don ’ t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ’ re running a busy office here . You ’ re going to have to keep up . ",3
" You ’ re right , sir . I apologize . I ’ ll get those files for you now . ",4
What sort of job would you like to take ? ,2
 I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator . ,3
 We need an operator now . ,3
 It's just the job I've been searching for . ,1
I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past . ,1
 I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process . ,1
 And it takes up all the news . ,1
 The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up . ,1
" It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public . ",1
 Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio . ,1
 I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio . ,1
 Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line . ,3
"Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ? ",3
 I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ? ,3
 Sure . No problem . ,4
" Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ? ",3
 Sure . Do you have my number ? ,2
" Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this . ",1
 No problem . I'll wait for your call . ,4
What are you typing there ? ,2
 I'm working on my resume . ,1
 Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ? ,2
" Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet . ",1
 Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ? ,2
 I didn ’ t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good . ,1
 Maybe I should try looking on the web for work . ,1
 Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls . ,3
 But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance . ,4
 How do you know if you don ’ t have a try ? ,3
Would you please show me the necklace in the window ? ,3
 Is this the one you want ? ,2
" No , the one next to it . ",1
 Here you are . ,1
 Thanks . What kind of stone is this ? ,2
 It's a ruby . It is from South Africa . Would you like to try it on ? ,2
" Yes , please . How much is it ? ",2
 It costs $ 200 . ,1
 It looks good . OK . I'll take it . ,1
"Happy birthday , Jim ! ",3
" Thank you , Lisa . ",4
 Here is a present for you . I hope you like it . ,3
" Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time . ",4
 I'm very glad to hear that . ,1
" Come here , let me introduce some friends to you . ",1
What's wrong with you ? You look pale . ,2
" I'm not sure , I feel hot and cold . ",1
 When did the trouble start ? ,2
 I was sick most of the night . ,1
 It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature . ,3
 Have I got a high fever ? ,2
" Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ? ",2
" Yes , I have . ",1
" Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - ' ",3
" Aaaaahh , aaaaahh . ",1
" Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests . ",3
" All right , thanks . ",4
 The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection . ,1
 What shall I do today ? ,2
" I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription . ",3
I have to check out today . I'd like my bill ready by 10 this morning . ,3
" You can be sure of that , sir . ",4
 Thank you . ,1
I called HP about my computer . ,1
 What did they say ? ,2
 They said I need a new hard drive . ,1
 That's too bad . How much is a new one ? ,2
" It's not too much , only about $ 85 . ",1
 Plus installation ? ,2
" No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace . ",1
 Really ? ,2
" Yes , it's just a couple of screws . ",1
 That's nice . ,1
 It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 . ,1
" If my hard drive crashes , I'll just call you . ",3
"Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class . ",1
 Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night . ,3
" Yes , Mum . ",4
Is there anything wrong ? ,2
 I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college . ,1
 Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager . ,1
 I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything . ,1
 You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision . ,3
 But I just want to give her some tips . ,4
" Oh , she can make her own decisions . ",1
 I guess you are right . ,1
 Believe me . Everything will be ok . ,3
 I hope so . ,4
It's beautiful here . ,1
 Yes . I feel refreshed . ,1
 How long will we dock ? ,2
 In half an hour . The surface of the lake is calm . ,1
 Yes . We come at the right time . ,1
"that was a really good meal , Gordon . ",1
 It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite . ,1
" well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home . ",3
 you're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow . ,4
 let's see how much the bill is . ,3
 don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat . ,4
 what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill . ,2
" no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't . ",1
" no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill . ",3
" alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill . ",4
" that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk . ",1
" just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ? ",3
 you've got a deal . ,4
 great . Bye . ,1
 bye . ,1
I hear you are planning to travel abroad . ,1
 Yes . I'm going to the Untied States for travel . What places do you recommend ? ,2
" In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles . ",1
 Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii . ,1
" Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight . ",3
 And Seattle is the home of Microsoft and Boeing . That must be a great place . I can't miss it . ,4
This looks like a very nice house . ,1
" You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it . ",1
 The style of the exterior is just what I ’ Ve been looking for ! ,1
 The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible . ,1
 This home is gorgeous on the inside ! ,1
" Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new . ",1
 The wall colors totally suit the style of this house . ,1
 Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen . ,1
 I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops . ,1
 The master suite is the best . Let ’ s go look at that next . ,3
" There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room . ",4
" I know that you like this house , but let ’ s take a look at the others before you make up your mind . ",3
Room service.What can I do for you ? ,2
 l am afraid there isn't any fancy soap in my room . ,3
" Sorry sir , we will bring you one.Anything else ? ",2
 Yes.Bring me a bath towel as well . ,3
Good afternoon.British Airline.Is there any thing I can do for you ? ,2
 Can I make a reservation for flight FW58 to San Marino ? ,3
 Sure . When do you want to take the plane ? ,2
 Next Monday . ,1
 Will that be first class or economy seat ? ,2
 What's the fare for a first class seat ? ,2
 $ 200 . ,1
 Oh . I am not a wall streeter.Give me an economy one please . ,3
"Hello , Sir . So , you are back ? ",2
" Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit . ",3
" That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate . ",1
 And I can purchase that here ? ,3
" Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle . ",4
Are there any beds vacant ? ,2
" Yes , what kind of room do you want ? ",2
" I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower . ",3
" Sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower . ",4
" Well , that's fine . ",1
Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company . ,2
 That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me . ,1
 You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ? ,2
" Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t ",1
" Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ? ",1
" Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff . ",1
" Well , welcome to the team . ",1
Good afternoon . I've brought the extra blanket you asked for . ,3
" Oh , thank you . ",4
 Is there anything I can do for you now ? ,3
 Yes . I'm rather tired and want to go to bed early . Please make the bed . ,3
" Certainly , sir . ",4
Lin's office supplies . How may I direct your call ? ,2
 Marry Lin please . ,1
" Sure , just a moment . ... I'm sorry no one answer the phone . ",1
" All right , could I leave a message ? ",3
 Certainly ! ,4
 Please ask her to call John . ,3
Excuse me . Where is the way out ? ,2
" Well , that's what I'm looking for myself . ",1
" It's very confusing in here , isn't it ? ",2
" Absolutely . Oh , do you see a sign there ? ",2
 It should be the way out . ,1
 OK . Let's go and see . ,3
"Excuse me , I ordered the well-done steak , but this one is so tough . ",1
" Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now . ",1
 I think you should be more careful next time . ,3
" Yes , sir . I'm really so sorry about that . ",4
"Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project . ",1
" Look , Sally . I ’ Ve put just as much work into this as anybody else . ",1
" No , I ’ m sorry . I disagree . I don ’ t think you ’ Ve been working at full speed at all . ",1
 Well . I ’ m sorry you feel that way . ,1
"Hi Joe , how are you doing today ? ",2
" Things are going good today . How have you been doing , Mary ? ",2
" Things are going well for me , Joe . ",1
 Want to go see a movie tonight ? ,3
 My parents are taking me to dinner tonight . ,4
" Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ? ",3
 What movie did you want to see ? ,2
 There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer . ,1
 I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ” ,3
 Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to ! ,4
How's the bride-to-be ? ,2
 Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache . ,1
" Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine ! ",1
 I'm worried that everything will be chaotic ! ,1
 Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests . ,1
" You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ... ",3
 I will . Don't worry ! ,4
Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ? ,2
" Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk . ",1
 Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk . ,1
" I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator . ",1
 Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ? ,2
 Nothing . ,1
 What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see . ,2
 Promise that you won't get angry . ,3
" OK , I promise . What is it ? ",2
 It's a kitty . ,1
" Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house . ",1
" Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble . ",3
 No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here . ,4
" Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame . ",3
 All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up . ,4
" I will . Thank you , Mummy . ",1
I was wondering if you could help me with something . ,3
" Sure , anything you say . ",4
" Actually , it ’ s a little bit silly . ",1
" Don ’ t worry about it , just ask . ",3
 What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ? ,2
 You need to know the type of shoes you want . ,1
 Don ’ t worry about that . I can point it out in the store . ,3
" The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low . ",4
 Let me write all that down . I ’ m going shopping this afternoon . ,1
Excuse me . How long has it been since the business was founded ? ,2
 It has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998 . ,1
" So , it has a history for more than a decade ? ",2
 Yes . And it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis . ,1
"What can I do for you , Madam ? ",2
 Can you help me with Comprehensive Credit Granting ? ,3
" Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ? ",2
" Well , everything really . ",3
" All right . We can grant a Financing Promise Quota , if you qualify . This means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way . Firstly , your Credit Rating must be class A , and your Debt to Asset Ratio must be top notch , for the industry you are involved in . ",1
Let's do something outdoors today . ,3
 All right . But I don't want to play tennis . We played tennis last weekend . ,4
 Okay . what do you want to do ? ,2
 I want to go jogging . ,1
 All right . That sounds like fun . ,1
Good afternoon . I come here specially to pick up my tickets . I booked it last month.This is my reservation note . ,3
" I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently.You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled . ",4
" But I have been so busy all these days.Well , is there any other ticket available ? I want the next one . ",2
The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest . ,1
 Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West . ,2
" No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . ",1
" You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ? ",2
" Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . ",1
 Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? ,2
" Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . ",1
 Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? ,2
" Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate . ",1
Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? ,3
" We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . ",2
" You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . ",3
" OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ? ",2
" I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time . ",3
" OK , will do . ",4
"I want a pair of sports shoes , Adidas . ",3
 What size do you want ? ,2
 I wear size 40 . ,1
 How about this one ? It's the latest design . ,3
" Oh , I like the color . ",4
May I help you ? ,2
 I'm looking for a pair of shoes . ,1
 What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale . ,2
 I wear size 36.This pair looks nice.Can I try them on ? ,3
" Of course , yes.They look nice.And they're not expensive . ",4
 How much are they ? ,2
 They are $ 168 . ,1
 I'll take them . ,1
A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ? ,2
 I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? ,2
" Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . ",1
" Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . ",1
" Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . ",1
" Ok , then we can sign up for it together . ",3
Who's it knocking at the door ? ,2
 I think it's the postman.Will you go and open the door ? ,3
 All right . I'll get it . ,4
Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ? ,2
" No , we don't . ",1
" How many of you , please ? ",2
" Six , including two kids . ",1
 I'm afraid all the big tables are taken . ,1
"Hi , I think I was supposed to call for my test results today . ",3
" If you go onto our website and put in your password , you can access your test results . ",3
 Are you saying that there weren ’ t any problems ? ,2
 I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem . ,3
 Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them ? ,2
" Yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about . ",1
 How will I know what the numbers mean ? ,2
 You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range . ,3
 How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ? ,2
 We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need . ,3
"This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee . ",1
 If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . ,3
 What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . ,1
 I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ? ,3
 What's your proposal ? ,2
" Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway . ",3
 Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible ! ,4
 What would you suggest ? ,2
 The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go . ,3
 That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with . ,3
 OK . We can meet halfway again . ,4
Hello . ,1
" Good morning , Ruth . Did I wake you up ? ",2
" No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ? ",2
" Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ? ",2
 B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown . ,1
" Oh , you mean Canal Street ? ",2
 That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown . ,1
" Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ? ",2
" At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ? ",2
 I cannot get hold of her yet . ,1
" See you around , Carl . ",1
 See you later . ,1
Has your company been affected much by government legislation ? ,2
" Yes , we have . We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards . ",1
 What about your use of raw materials ? ,2
" Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ’ re not allowed to use lead in our products any more . ",1
 What happens if you exceed the limits ? ,2
 We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine . ,1
Have you got any better ? ,2
 That's the best there is . ,1
" Okay , I'll take one . ",1
" That'll be $ 200 , sir . ",1
"Good morning , sir . Sorry to disturb you . May I make up the room now ? ",3
" Yes , please . We're on our way out , so we put the ' make up ' sign on . Could you bring us some towels and hangers ? ",3
" No problem , sir . Everything will be ready when you come back . ",4
What are the factors that have great impact on the perspective of this corporation ? ,2
" External factors . I think the main external factors are political , economic , social and technological factors . ",1
 What are the internal factors that influence the company ? ,2
" The internal factors are composed of human resources , team spirit , innovation spirit and coordination between different departments , etc . ",1
"I don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday . ",1
 What words ? Can you tell me ? ,3
" He says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy , very quickly if I do something that he doesn ’ t like . You know , if I wash his face or change his clothes , things like that . ",4
" Honey , I don ’ t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason . ",3
" Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable . ",4
" I suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness . ",3
" It ’ s easy to say , but I will try . ",4
" Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire . ",3
" I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ’ t work , instead he picks up another bad habit . ",4
How can I help you ? ,3
" Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates . I would like to see Mr . Smith . ",3
 Do you have an appointment ? ,2
" Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock . ",1
 I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ? ,3
 Sure . ,4
" Yes , Mr . Mason , I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry , she said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She could be with your shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ? ",3
 That would be very nice . Thank you . ,4
" Right this way , Mr . Mason . We can start with our front office . When Ms . Terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor . There is a conference room already prepared ",3
did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ? ,2
" no , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend . ",1
" yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go . ",1
 they must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood . ,1
 they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want . ,1
 I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars . ,1
 did either one of them win an Oscar this year ? ,2
" I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything . ",1
" Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ? ",2
" yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous . ",1
 I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . ,1
 people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated . ,1
 I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you . ,1
 that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go . ,1
 thank goodness we're not rich and famous ! ,1
" being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich . ",1
"Next , please . ",3
 Could I purchase Euro with RIB here ? I have to stay here for months . ,3

" Yes , I have known of it . ",1
 How much do you like to exchange ? ,2
" 20,000 RIB . ",3
 In what denominations ? ,2
" It doesn't matter , but leave me some small changes , that will be convenient in daily life . ",3
" Right , I will exchange for you now . Please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone . ",3
" Well , could you change them too ? The dollars , I want to change them into Swiss francs . ",3
" OK , wait for a moment . Well , I am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . In this case , you'd better change 2,000 $ to Swiss francs . ",3
 It doesn't matter . ,4
 Please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo . ,3
 Thanks a lot . Good-bye . ,4
Why are you holding me in this jail cell ? ,2
 We'd like to hear your account of the events of last night . ,3
I have to go up to London for a couple of days next week . Would you like to come ? ,3
 That would be nice . How are you getting there ? ,2
" Well , I prefer to go on the train , but I suppose you want me to take the car . ",3
" Oh , I much prefer to go by car , then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and ... ",3
 And I've got to drive . You know I'm not fond of that . I found it much more relaxing to sit in the train . ,4
 Which is more expensive ? ,2
 But very much quicker . But I know we'll never agree on this subject . You prefer the car . I prefer the train . ,1
" Now , have you ever thought of going by express bus ? ",3
I want to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front . ,3
 What a wonderful neighborhood ! Can you find that house on our Open House list ? ,2

 I need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it . ,1
 Is the current asking price listed on the flyer ? ,2
 The asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars . ,1

" Oh , oh , Madam , Madam , I'm afraid you have the wrong number . ",1
 Isn't this the car store ? ,2
 No . It's Mike's Sporting Goods . ,1
" Oh , sorry . Do you know the number for a car store , then ? ",2
 No . I don't . I suggest you look in the phone book . ,1
 I'm sorry to have bothered you . ,1
 No problem . ,1

 That's so great ! ,1
 How much are you selling it for ? ,2
 This t . v is only $ 2500 . ,1
 You can't be serious . ,1
 That's how much this t . v costs . ,1
 That's too expensive for me . ,1
 This television is of very high quality . ,1

" I'm sorry , but the price is final . ",4

"Hey , son , are you insured ? ",2
" Not yet , but I'm thinking of it . Have you bought one , Dad ? ",2
 I took out a life insurance policy and made your mother the beneficiary . ,1
 Can you tell me why you want to buy it ? ,3
 I am a fireman and it is a dangerous job . I have to consider your mother's life . ,2
" Oh , I see . Do you advise me to buy one ? ",2
" You have children now . What if something , God forbid , happens to you ? ",3
" That's true . Well , how much do you think I should get ? ",2

 I'm going to the hospital to see Susan . ,1
 I saw her yesterday.She was a little better . ,1
 Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ? ,2

" Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ? ",2
" Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus . ",1
" Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 . ",1
 But number 13 buses leave from the center of town.You ' ll have to walk two miles to catch one . ,1
"Good morning , Passport , please . ",3
 Here you are . ,4
" Ah , thank you.Please bring your luggage here for inspection . ",3
 Ok.But is there anything wrong ? ,2
 It's just a regular inspection . Do you have anything to declare ? ,2
" I've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne.Besides , I have two cameras , one is for my own use , and the other is a gift . ",1
" Well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty-free allowance . But according to our law , each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free.You ' ll have to pay duty for the other one . ",3
 Ok . Where shall I pay duty for it ? ,2

 I've paid for it . Here's the receipt . ,1
 Very well . I hope you ' ll enjoy your stay in America . ,1

 How can I have the good external expressions ? ,2

 OK . What about going to the movies on Friday night ? ,3
 What were you planning on seeing ? ,2
 I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer . ,1
 How about “ The Secret Life of Bees ” ? ,3
 That's a chick flick ! ,4
What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ? ,2
" First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations . ",1
 That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff . ,3
" I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of ",3
" Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD . ",4
 Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ? ,3
 The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ? ,2
 Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month . ,1
 When will the branch office open ? ,2
 Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly . ,1
 Has and advertising campaign been prepared ? ,2
" Yes , it has . We ’ re going to target the business community through business magazines . ",1
 I made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . We should be able to get plenty of customers . ,1

 May I have your key please ? ,3
 Sure . Here you are . ,4
 Here is your valuable . Is that right ? ,2

did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ? ,2
 why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that . ,1
" well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers . ",1
 do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ? ,2
" no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions . ",1
 it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America . ,1
" religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal . ",1
 what do you think about abortion ? ,2
" I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself . ",1
 do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ? ,2
" I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children . ",1
" why not ? It's their children , too . ",2
" that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand . ",1
" that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter . ",1
"Come to think of it , you should get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments . ",3
 But I don't have any reading assignments . ,4
 Then review for your test . You'll do even better . And maybe reading will help you get to sleep . ,3
" Aw , Mom-you're such a drag . ",4
" You say that now , Lily , but you'll thank me later . I'm your mom , and mother knows best . ",1
I'm just calling to see if you have made any decision about the position . ,2
" Sorry , we haven't made the decision at all . ",1
 Do you have any idea when you might arrive at a decision ? ,2
 We will let you know probably next Monday . I hope to give you a positive reply . ,3
 I'm willing to wait until you have come to a decision . ,4
How did you find your apartment ? ,2
 You can check on the bulletin boards at school for local housing . ,1
 What if I need a roommate ? ,2
 There are websites that can hook you up with a roommate . ,1
 How much do apartments cost around here ? ,2
 It depends on what you want . Do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment ? ,2
 I just need a one-bedroom apartment . ,1
 That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month . ,1
 Would you come with me to look at apartments ? ,3
 I would be happy to look at apartments with you . ,4
Have you heard what happened ? ,2
 Heard what ? ,2
 Deborah already had her baby . ,1
 I didn't know that . ,1
 I thought you knew . ,1
 I honestly didn't know . ,1
 The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces . ,1
 That's good to hear . ,1
 Will you go and visit them ? ,2
 Of course I will . ,1
 I just wanted to give you the good news . ,1
 Thanks for letting me know . ,1
How silly of you to jump out of the window ! ,1
 But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake ! ,1
 Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time . ,2
 That would be too late . ,1
 Maybe the situation is too urgent . ,1
" Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case . ",1
I need to stop eating such unhealthy foods . ,1
 I know what you mean . I've started eating better myself . ,1
 What foods do you eat now ? ,2

 Those are the only things you eat ? ,2
 That's basically what I eat . ,1
 Why aren't you eating anything else ? ,2
" Well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy . ",1
 And the chicken ? ,2
 It's really healthy to eat when you bake it . ,1
 I guess that does sound a lot healthier . ,1

The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here ! ,3
 Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up . ,4
 That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! ,1
 Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . ,1
 I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . ,1
Do you have anything to do after this ? ,2
" No , I don't . ",1
 Shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ? ,3
 That sounds like a good idea . ,4
 I know a very interesting place . ,3
" Oh , do you ? Good . ",4
"Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ? ",2
" I'd love to , the movies are smash hit . ",1
 Then let's go in . ,3
" I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late . ",4
 I'll say the movie's starting in the minute . ,1
 I know . I wonder what's keeping him . ,1
" Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ? ",2
" Yeah , a number of times . ",1
 What's he trying to pull anyway . ,1
 I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw . ,1
 Maybe you should start seeing someone else . ,3
" You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy . ",4
I can't believe how hot it is . ,1
 It's not even noon yet . ,1
 That means it will get hotter . ,1
 I am dying from the heat . ,1
 Turn on the air conditioner . ,3
 It doesn't work . ,4
 What happened ? ,2
 I don't know . ,1
 Did you call the repairman ? ,2

 I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days . ,1

 You can say that again . ,1

" You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo , do you ? ",2
" Well , I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true ! ",1
 Of course it does ! They tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . I think most of the times they are just scam artists . ,1
" Well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . Reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes . ",1

 You can have a bird view of Guiling City from the top of the mountain . ,1
 Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing . ,1
" You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning . ",1
 No wonder people say ,1
" Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky ! ",1
 I didn't know you liked bird-watching . ,1
" I don't really . I just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . This place is full of it . ",1
"Hide me , Yi-jun ! The kids all think I'm the real Easter bunny ! ",1
" Aw , that's sweet ! I knew your costume would be a success . ",1

" definitely ! Actually , we just moved into a new place . There's a house-warming party this Saturday , if you are free ? I know Jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party . ",3
 sounds great ! I'll be there . ,4
"I guess I'm just a little nervous . I'm giving everything I have to invoking , and ... ",1
" and what if it doesn't work out , right ? ",2
 Exactly . ,1
 You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . You know how I know ? ,2
 How ? ,2
 Because I won't let it fail . ,1
" But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars.com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ? ",2

 Thank you . ,1
I ’ m fed up with marriage . ,1
 Why do you say so ? Everyone admires that you have a good wife . ,2
" Oh , no . When we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . It was a hard time . ",1
 But now you are rich . ,1
 And we have some squabbles on some boring things . ,1

 What other kind of music do you listen to ? ,2
" Actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ? ",2
" To be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me . ",1
 What kind of music do you prefer then ? ,2
 I like pop music . Do you ? ,2
 Not really . I don't think pop music has much depth . ,1
 I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much . ,1
" How long have you been in to pop music , then ? ",2
 I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ? ,2
" Not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all . ",1
" So , how did you become interested in it ? ",2
" Well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started . ",1
 Do you still play piano ? ,2
" Yes , it's one of my hobbies . ",1
"Hi Paul . How are you , friend . ",2
 Not good . My cousin is driving me up the wall . ,1
 How so ? ,2
" He stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help . ",1
 Have you talk to him about it ? ,2
" Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night ",1
" Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight . ",1
" This is no laughing matter , Nick . ",1
 Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ? ,2
 He watch the tob too much . Now really I don't know . But I can't handle this much longer . ,1
" Well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , OK ? ",3
"You're from New York , aren't you ? ",2
" Yes , that's right . ",1
 What do you suggest I should see in New York ? ,2
" Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ? ",3
" No , I don't like museums . They're boring . ",4
 Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ? ,3
 Ah ! That sounds interesting . ,4
What's your favorite book ? ,2
 It's Gone With the Wind . ,1
 Why do you like it best ? ,2
 I enjoy the various characters and the plot . ,1
 Well . I like the Thom Birds best . ,1
 Is it very interesting ? ,2
" Sure . I like the writer's language , too . ",1
" If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book . ",1
 Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ? ,3
 That's a good idea . Let's go ! ,4
"John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? ",2
" Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ? ",2
" It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day . ",1
" You forgot all of about it , didn't you ? ",2
I ’ m pretty sure that Jim will turn out to be a good lawyer . ,1
 How can you be so sure ? ,2
" He knows a lot about law and he ’ s eloquent , too . ",1
Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr . Miller ? ,3
 Yes . Are you going to be taking a class from him ? ,2
" Yes , but I have never taken his class before . ",1
 He is very interesting and challenging . Is that what you are looking for ? ,2
" Yes , that's what I need . ",1
 He is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade . Are you willing to study hard ? ,2
" Yes , I guess so . ",1
 What I really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . Do you enjoy that in a teacher ? ,2
" Yes , I had a teacher like that before . ",1
 Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience ? ,2
" No , I didn't , but that could be a good thing . ",1
" Well , take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you . Good luck ! ",3
"Honey , what's wrong with you ? ",2
 I'm not feeling well . I'm very nervous . ,1
 Take it easy . We are going to have our own baby . You should be happy . ,1
" Yeah , I know . ",1
" The doctors and the nurses will help you . And I will be waiting for you right here , praying for you and our baby . ",1
" Thank you , dear . I feel better now . ",1
The weather is terrible . ,1
 Yeah . It's been raining a lot these days . ,1
 I have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain . ,1
 Have you heard when it's supposed to get better ? ,2
" I saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days . ",1
 That sucks so much . What are we going to do ? ,2
 I'm getting pretty bored . We should do something despite the rain . ,1
 I'm with you . What do you have in mind ? ,2
 I haven't been to the Mall in a long time . Let's go there . ,1
" That sounds good . They have a movie theatre there , so if we get bored , we can watch a movie . ",3
 Great . I'll stop by your place now . ,4
 Ok . Don't forget to bring your umbrella . The rain can start up again anytime . ,2
"Come in , come in , what can I do for you ? ",2
" Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? ",2
" Yes , I am applying on it . ",1
" I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ... ",3
 Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up . ,4
" I know , but geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field . ",3
" Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll . ",4
" Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you . ",1
"... so , I said , let ’ s take a break.And since that night , I ’ Ve been waiting for him to call , but I still haven ’ t heard from him . You don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else , do you ? ",2
" Come on , don ’ t be so dramatic ! I ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine . ",1
" You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ? ",2
" But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes . ",1
 He ’ s the love of my life ! I ’ Ve really messed this up . ,1
" Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ’ s going to be alright . ",3
" But I ... I still love him ! And it ’ s all my fault ! I can ’ t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ’ Ve totally messed this up ! ",1
" You know what , Veronica , I think you should make the first step . I ’ m sure he ’ ll forgive you ... ",3
" No , this is not gonna happen ! I ... I ’ Ve ruined everything ... ",4
 do you hear something ? ,2
"what's wrong , Jerry ? You look so upset . ",2
" to be honest , I was just dumped . ",1
" oh , I'm sorry to hear that . You can go on a holiday to cheer you up . ",3
" no , thanks . I'm not in the mood for traveling . ",4
 come on . A trip will do you good . Are you doing anything this weekend ? ,2
 I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing . ,1
" well , my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday . Do you want to come with us ? ",3
 where is that ? ,2
 not very far from here . We'll fly . It's about one and a half hours . ,1
 what's there to see ? ,2
" there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes . ",1
" oh , sounds nice . ",1
" yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . I have some pictures at home . You can come over and take a look if you like . ",3
 ok . Then I can make up my mind . ,4
Did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies ? ,2
" Yes , just once . ",1
 What was the reason ? ,2
 I once played truant when I was in college because I intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster-hit areas in Sichuan . ,1
Do you want to hang out tomorrow ? ,3
" Oh , I can't . I have a date ! ",4
 Really ? Wow with who ? ,2
 This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend . ,1
" Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ? ",2
" Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat . ",1
 That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ? ,2
" It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy . ",1
 I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out ! ,1
"Well , I'm afraid I must be going now . I have no idea it was so late . ",1
 Stay for dinner with us . ,3
" I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight . You see , I am going to England the day after tomorrow . ",4
" Well , I won't keep you then . It was very nice of you to come to see me . ",1
 It has been a pleasure . Goodbye . ,1
 Goodbye . Thank you again for coming . ,1
"Honey , do you have a second ? ",2
 Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried.What ’ s on your mind ? ,2
 We need to talk . ,3
 Okay ... ,4
" I ’ Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people . ",3
" What ? Why ? I mean , we ’ Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ? ",2
" That ’ s just it , I ’ m not happy anymore , Tim . It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for ! ",1
" So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ? ",2
" Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry . ",1
" Baby , come on . Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me . ",3
" I can ’ t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ’ m only doing this for you . I don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do . ",4
 Laura ... ,1
" Here are your keys . I ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ’ m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ’ ll always love you . Goodbye . ",1
"Oh , my God . I can't take it any more . ",1
" What's wrong , honey ? Take it easy . ",2
 I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible . ,1
 Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change . ,1
 You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ? ,1
 But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company . ,1
" Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help . ",1
 Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation . ,3
 I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career . ,1
 Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting . ,3
 That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that . ,1
 How about a training course ? ,3
 A training course ? That must be costly . ,4
 But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future . ,1
" OK , let's have a try . ",4
 OK . ,1
Have you seen the new James Bond movie ? ,2
" Oh , yes . You ? ",2
 Yes . What did you think of it ? ,2
 I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it . What did you think of it ? ,2
" Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ? ",2
" Mmm . That's what I thought too . I really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan . ",1
" Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ? ",2
" Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ? ",2
" Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ? ",2
" Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ? ",2
 I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond ! ,1
 Yes ! ,1
My friend Jean is very beautiful . ,1
 What's her figure ? ,2
" Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too . ",1
 What's the color of her eyes ? ,2
 Dark blue . ,1
Where are you going ? ,2
 I'm going to buy a CD . ,1
 Why not listen to music online ? ,2
" Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , isn't it ? ",2
" You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it . ",1
" I have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened . ",1
" In order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software . ",1
 Can you recommend some to me ? ,2
 Certainly . Realplayer is a good . ,3
 Can I download it ? ,2
" Yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it . ",1
 I'll try it tonight . ,4
What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense . ,2
" Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate . ",1
" Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ? ",2
 He asked me how long it took me to learn English . ,1
" But , you were born and raised in California ! ",1
" Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes . ",1
 What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ? ,2
" You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice . ",1
" So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ? ",2
" I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it . ",1
 Are you sure he really got the message ? ,2
" Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English . ",1
 That's hilarious ! What did he say ? ,2
" He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good . ",1
 I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again . ,1
Could you tell me the origin of the Dragon-Boat Festival ? ,3
" Yes , it's a way to commemorate a great ancient romantic poet , and the race is a symbol of the attempt to save him . ",4
 I see.Did they succeed in the end ? ,2
 Of course not.He drowned . ,1
What can I do for you today ? ,2
 I would like to use a computer . ,3
 Do you have your library card ? ,3
 I sure do . ,4
 There is a wait for the computers . ,3
 That ’ s all right . ,4
 You need to print your name on this list . ,3
 Okay . Now what ? ,2
" Once a computer is available , I will let you know . ",3
 How am I supposed to log on to the computer ? ,2
 All you do is type in the number on the back of your card . ,3
 That ’ s it ? Thank you very much . ,4
"how are you doing , Christopher ? ",2
" to be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break ! ",1
 are you doing anything this weekend ? ,2
 I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job ! ,1
 are you available on Sunday ? ,2
" yes , that's my only day off until Thursday . ",1
" ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ? ",3
 that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ? ,2
 it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city . ,1
 what should I bring with me ? ,2
" we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger . ",1
 I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun . ,1
 do you like surfing ? ,2
 I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ? ,2
 we've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun ! ,1
 I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ? ,2
" you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money . ",3
" ok , where and when should I meet you ? ",2
 we'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square ! ,3
I'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss . ,1
 It'll take us all some time to get used to the change . ,1
I give up ! I simply can't learn French ! ,1
 Why do you say that ? I think you're making a lot of progress . ,2
" No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well . ",1
 Learning any language takes a lot of effort.But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ? ,3
 Good idea . That might help . ,4
He said I have a big nose . I wonder what that means . ,1
" You are interested in other people ’ s business , aren ’ t you ? ",2
 Does he mean I am inquisitive or I ’ m noisy ? ,2
 Yes . ,1
"Excuse me , I'd like to ask you a few questions about the city . ",3
" OK , please . ",4
" My wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ? ",2
" I would recommend the mall , it's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . It has a wide range of shops and restaurants . ",1
" Thank you . Also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town . Can you recommend some local attractions ? ",3
 How old are your children ? ,2
 I have a 10 - year-old boy and a 6 - year-old girl . ,1
 I would recommend a day at the zoo . It's fun for all the family . There is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip . ,3
 It sounds marvelous . Thank you for your help . ,4
"Boy , it looks like everyone in your family is here , from young to old . ",1
 Easter's a good day for reunions . The family goes to church together . ,1
 And after church they come here for lunch ? ,2
" Yup , a big potluck buffet . And then-notice there are no children around ? ",2
" Yeah , what's up with that ? ",2
" The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . Hide away , Yi-jun ! ",1
Hi ! I'm happy you could make it . ,1
" Well , I've been looking forward to seeing you . ",1
 What can I get you ? ,3
 I'd love a gin and tonic . ,4
Could you please help me to check out the book ? ,3
" Sure , what's the author's name , please . ",3
 I can't remember that clearly . It probably be Charles ... ,1
 Charles Dickens ? ,2
" No , no , no . I'm not interested in literature . ",1
" OK , do you know the title of the book ? ",2
" Oh , sorry . I'm always absent-minded . I remember that I've put a note in my pocket . ",1
" So , show me the note please . ",3
 I can't find it now . ,4
" Oh , such bad luck , sir . Can you please name the category of the book ? ",3
 Let me see . It's not fiction . It's biography . ,3
" OK , I'll search it for you . A moment , please . ",4
 Thanks . ,1
How do you decide what grade we get ? ,2
" I look at many things , attendance , quizzes , and tests . ",1
 What is the most important factor ? ,2
" Obviously I look for improvement as we go along , but I would like you to do your best from the beginning . ",1
 How can we keep track of our grades ? ,2
" The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent . ",1
 What if we can't get to school ? ,2
 You can only miss one class without penalty . ,1
" If we have a major problem , will you let us know ? ",2
 I will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem . ,1
We're thinking about going to America . ,1
 Have you thought about the cost ? ,2
 There is that . ,1
 I believe it'll be very expensive . ,1
May I help you with something ? ,2
 I would like to return some books . ,3
 I ’ ll take them . ,3
 Here you go . ,4
 These books were due two weeks ago . ,1
 Yeah . I totally forgot they were due . ,1
 You will need to pay late fees on these books . ,3
 How much are the late fees ? ,2
 The fee is 25 cents every day . ,1
 I have to pay 25 cents a day ? ,2
 And that ’ s for each book that is late . ,3
 That shouldn ’ t be a problem . ,4
This is such a beautiful day ! Great for sailing ! ,1
 It sure is ! The water looks so nice ! Anchor the boat for a little while . I ’ m going to take a dip . ,1
 Why are you doggy-paddling ? I taught you how to swim ! Do your breast stroke ! ,2
" I get too tired ! I ’ ll just backstroke , it ’ s easier ! ",1
 Try kicking your legs more . That ’ s good . Don ’ t go out too far ! ,3
 It ’ s fine . Jump in ! ,4
 Kathy ! Get back here ! I see a shark ! ,1
 Ahahah ! ! ! Help me ! Help ! Bring the boat closer ! The shark is coming straight towards me ! ,1
 It ’ s right under you ! Kathy ! ! ! ,1
"what was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ? ",2
 my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate . ,1
 three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive ! ,1
" well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive . ",1
 were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? ,2
" I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . ",1
 did your husband's family get to meet your family ? ,2
" my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t ",1
 that makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ? ,2
 we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa . ,1
" you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? ",2
" not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! ",1
"Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ? ",2
" I'd love to , the movies are smash hit . ",1
 Then let's go in . ,3
" I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late . ",4
 I'll say the movie's starting in the minute . ,1
 I know . I wonder what's keeping him . ,1
" Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ? ",2
" Yeah , a number of times . ",1
 What's he trying to pull anyway . ,1
 I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw . ,1
 Maybe you should start seeing someone else . ,3
" You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy . ",4
"So , you ’ re applying for a B2 visa , where is your final destination and what ’ s the purpose of your trip to the United States ? ",2
 I ’ m going to visit my brother . he ’ s just had a baby . He lives in Minneapolis . ,1
 And how long do you you plan to remain in the United States ? ,2
" I ’ ll be here for approximately three weeks . See , here ’ s my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of March . ",1
" And , who is sponsoring your trip ? ",2
" My brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . I will stay with him and his family in their home . ",1
" Alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country . ",1
" Well , I own a house . actually , I ’ m leaving my dog there with my neighbors . I have a car at home , and oh , my job ! I ’ m employed by Tornal as an engineer . Actually , I only have three weeks ’ vacation , so I have to go back to work at the end of March . ",1
 And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ? ,2
" Well , I do have assets in my country . like I said , I own a house , and see , here ’ s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance . ",1
" I ’ m sorry , sir , we cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time , instead , you are granted a resident visa ! Congratulations , you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! You win ! Congratulations ! ",1
"Good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ? ",2
" Well , I am a bit out of shape . I'm thinking about getting some exercises to keep fit . ",1
" Oh , that's good news for us . ",1
 So what do you provide ? ,2
" First of all , we'll design a custom-made work-out plan according to your habits . ",1
 How can you get that done ? ,2
" Well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . And he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan for your needs . ",1
 What else ? ,2
" Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal . ",1
 Sounds pretty good . What about the charge ? ,2
" That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year . ",1
 Maybe one month . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning . ,1
 Wise decision . You'll find it's totally worth it . ,1
Do you watch a lot of TV ? ,2
 Not really . I could take it or leave it . ,1
 Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on . ,1
 How can you do that ? ,2
Hi . What's your name ? ,2
 My name is Jung Min . What's your name ? ,2
 My name is Jessica . It's nice to meet you . ,1
 Yes . It's nice to meet you too . Are you a new student too ? ,2
 No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ? ,2
 Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here . ,1
 Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ? ,2
" I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here . ",1
" I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea . ",1
 Why were you in Japan ? ,2
 My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures . ,1
 That's pretty cool . ,1
 I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents . ,1
" Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around . ",3
" Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class . ",4
 Ok . ,1
Guess who I saw just now ? ,2
 Who ? ,2
" John Smith , the escaped criminal . ",1
" That bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy . ",1
 I think I must report to the cops . ,1
 Ok . ,1
What do you think of this one ? ,2
" Eh , so so . ",1
 And this one ? Too flashy ? ,2
" Nah , not too flashy . ",1
 Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ? ,2
 I guess . ,1
 Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you . ,2
" And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes ! ",1
 Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon ! ,1
 Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! ,1
" Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! ",1
" Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? ",2
 I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! ,1
Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ’ s OK . ,1
" Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ’ t go into detail , but it wasn ’ t serious . ",1
 I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital . ,1
" I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation . ",1
 It must have really hurt afterwards . ,1
" Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing . ",1
 I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital . ,1
" I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ’ t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list ! ",1
 Is there any pain now ? ,2
" No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days . ",1
 Did they take good care of you in the hospital ? ,2
" Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay . ",1
How was the party ? ,2
 I had a fantastic time . ,1
"Hi , Monica , how is everything going ? ",2
" Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job . ",1
 Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ? ,2
" I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out . ",1
 That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application . ,1
" Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later . ",1
" Ok , good luck to you . ",1
"Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ? ",2
 Yeah . But he soon feel regretted for it . ,1
 But he seems to be very happy with Rose . ,1
 He is more nice than wise . ,1
"Hello , is that Cathy speaking ? ",2
" Yes , is that you , Allen ? ",2
" Yes , how are you doing ? ",2
 Not bad . ,1
 Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ? ,3
 Sure.Thank you very much . ,4
 Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty.OK ? ,3
" Ok , see you . ",4
 See you . ,1
The weather has been terrible this week . ,1
" Yeah , I'm worried . If it's like this tomorrow , our big outdoor party will have to be canceled . ",1
 Let's hope it clears up . ,1
Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ? ,2
" Yeah , I'm afraid so . ",1
" If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude . ",1
" Yes , it is annoying . ",1
"Hi , Mr . Smith . what's new ? ",2
" Nothing particular . But , ... ",1
 What's the matter ? ,2
" I , I don't know how to explain it to you . ",1
" Go ahead . It's nothing serious . We are good friends , aren't we ? ",2
" Yes , of course . But I'm afraid I can't tell you . ",1
How do you do ? ,1
" How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Ms . Smith . I ’ m Jack Stevens from the Marketing Department . Here is my card . ",1
" It ’ s nice to meet you , Mr . Stevens . ",1
" Please call me Jack . Have a seat , please . ",3
 Thank you . ,4
Thanks for your hospitality . ,1
 You're welcome . ,1
I'm terribly sorry to have caused you so much trouble . ,1
 That's all right . ,1
"Hey , what's new ? ",2
 Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ? ,2
" Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me . ",1
 What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ? ,2
" Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful . ",1
" That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day . ",2
 But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope . ,1
"Lily , can you take part in our picnic this weekend ? ",3
 That sounds great . Where are you going ? ,4
" I think we can go to the river , go around and have supper . ",1
 What should I bring ? ,2
 Nothing . Just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking . We'll bring everything . ,1
What do you think of doctor Thomson ? ,2
 I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease . ,1
 How can you be so sure ? ,2
 I can tell form the way he spoke to us . ,1
 Never believe his words . ,1
Should we ask Jason to play ? He's always watching movies on HBO . ,3
 I guess we should invite him . I just hope he doesn't start talking about Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger again . ,4
" Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad . ",1
" Yeah , you're right . We'll never hear the end of it . ",1
What do you think about violence in movies ? ,2
" Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch . ",1
" But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ? ",2
" If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun . ",1
Are you free tomorrow night ? ,2
" Yes , I am . ",1
 Shall we have dinner together ? ,3
 Do you have a special restaurant in mind ? ,2
" Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food . ",1
 OK . I'll be happy to join you . ,4
If only our company prescribe flex time . ,1
 The board has been considering introducing flex time . ,1
" Good news . Ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided . ",1
 Then our entire job could be done by telecommuting . ,1
"Brian , do you know how to speak English ? ",2
 Yes . ,1
 Where did you learn ? ,2
 I learned in college . ,1
 You speak really well . ,1
 Thank you . ,1
 How long have you been in the U . S . ? ,2
 3 weeks . ,1
 Is your wife with you ? ,2
" Yes , she just got here yesterday . ",1
 Have you been to California before ? ,2
 No . I've never been there . ,1
 Have you ever been to Las Vegas ? ,2
 Yes . I went there once on a business trip . ,1
How are the children doing at sport ? ,2
 I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age . ,1
" He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? ",2
" He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone his age . ",1
 Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? ,2
 The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . ,1
 How are they at swimming ? ,2
" They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . ",1
 Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . ,1
 I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height ! ,1
" I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . ",1
" It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further . ",1
"Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ? ",2
" Yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day . ",1
 Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time . ,1
" Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ... ",1
 Is everything ready now ? ,2
" Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive . ",1
 Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job . ,2
" Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet . ",1
" It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . ",1
 That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception . ,1
 I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available . ,3
 Thank you . ,4
 My pleasure . ,1
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? ,2
" Sorry , I thought you knew . ",1
 But you should have told me you were in love with her . ,1
 Didn't I ? ,2
 You know you didn't . ,1
" Well , I'm telling you now . ",1
" Yes , but you might have told me before . ",1
 I didn't think you'd be interested . ,1
 You can't be serious.How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? ,2
" Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . ",1
" Oh , you men ! You're all the same . ",1
"Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? ",2
 Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . ,3
 What about water pollution instead of pollution ? ,4
How ’ s it going ? ,2
 I ’ m fine . Thank you . ,1
 Do you need anything ? ,2
 I need you to help me . ,3
 What can I do for you ? ,2
 I am looking for an article in a newspaper . ,3
 Did you check the periodicals ? ,3
 I didn ’ t even bother to think of that . ,4
 I ’ ll show you where to find your article . ,3
 I get lost in this library . ,1
 It ’ s right this way . ,3
 Thanks a lot for your help . ,1
How about eating out for a drink with me tonight . ,3
 Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ? ,3
" No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ? ",3
 All right . See you tomorrow night . ,4
"Hi , Helen ! how is it going ? ",2
 I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work . ,1
" Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you . ",3
 I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now . ,4
 Why don't you take a few days off ? ,3
 I can't . I am really behind of my work . ,4
Can you speak Japanese ? ,2
" Yes , I can , but not very well . ",1
 Where did you learn it ? ,2
 At school . And I'm still learning it now . ,1
 How long have you been learning it ? ,2
 About three years . ,1
 Can you speak any other languages ? ,2
 I'm afraid not . ,1
"Good afternoon , Johnson . ",1
" Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ? ",2
" Not bad , thanks . ",1
I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime ! ,1
 God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ? ,2
" Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day . ",1
 They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest . ,2
 I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project . ,1
 You'd better pay more attention to your health . ,3
" I will , thanks for your concern . ",4
 You're welcome . ,1
It is too bad today . ,1
 What happened ? ,2
" My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it . ",1
 How did you find him at last ? ,2
 It was the police wo helped me to do that . ,1
 It must have taught you a lesson this time . ,1
I want to give our kitchen the works . ,1
 Why ? I think it ’ s convenient and good . ,2
 No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ’ s modern . ,1
 Why should we run after the fashion ? ,2
 I am not running after the fashion . I just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen . ,1
Rock music really leaves me cold . What about you ? ,2
 I'm crazy about it.It makes me very excited . ,1
 Then tell me what's good about it . ,1
 It can't be expressed by words . ,1
What's wrong with Debbie today ? She seems upset about something . ,2
 I have no idea . Maybe she had a fight with her husband . ,1
"Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one . ",1
" Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal . ",1
" Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . ",1
" I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . ",1
"Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ? ",2
" Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well . ",1
 Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion . ,1
" That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic . ",1
 Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert . ,1
" Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner . ",1
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? ,2
 What ? Why do we have to do that ? ,2
" Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . ",1
" I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! ",1
" That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! ",1
" That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time ! ",1
I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight . How about you ? ,2
" Yes , I ‘ d love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . ",1
" I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo . ",1
 Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ? ,1
" I ‘ m really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders . ",1
 You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ? ,2
" You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film . ",1
 It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress . ,1
How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ? ,2
 We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education . ,1
 Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job . ,1
 But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things . ,1
How do you celebrate national day in your country ? ,2
 There are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building . ,1
 What kinds of parades are there ? ,2
" The parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . What do you do on national day in your country ? ",2
 We don ’ t have a national day . ,1
 Really ? That ’ s unusual . ,2
" I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ’ t . ",1
" Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day . ",1
"Hi Melissa , are you going home this weekend ? ",2
" No , not this weekend . I have too much work to do . ",1

 Not great . It's a kind of boring . ,1
 Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great . ,2
" Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed . ",1
"What happened , John ? ",2
 Nothing . ,1
 Why do you look unhappy ? ,2
 I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off . ,1
" Oh , cheer up . He ’ ll understand you . ",1
 I hope so . ,1
You know that ? Joan has got the scholarship . ,1
 Really ? ,2
 But I think Henry is a backroom boy.He always helps her with her study . ,1
 You're right . ,1
"Hi , Tina , I ’ Ve got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising . ",1
 That is awesome . Congratulation ! I know you can make it . ,1
 Thanks . Let ’ s go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ? ,3

 No problem . See you ! ,4
 See you ! ,1
Do you like ethnic food ? ,2
" I do ! My favorites are Mexican , Thai , and Indian . ",1
 Really ? Have you ever tried Moroccan ? ,2
 I can't say that I have . What are the basic ingredients ? ,2
 I don't know . A friend of mine said I should try it . ,1
 Do you know where a Moroccan restaurant is ? ,2
" As a matter of fact , he gave me this address . ",1
 Let's go there for lunch ! I'm up for an adventure ! ,1
"Nicole , your Fettucini is very ... unique . ",1
" But not as good as your mother's , right ? ",2
" Actually , it's better ... ",1
 What ? Are you kidding ? ,2
 No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ... ,1
" Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you ! ",1
" OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ... ",1
How many people are there in your family ? ,2
" Five.My father , mother , brother , sister-in-law and me . ",1
 Is your brother older or younger than you ? ,2
" He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday.My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age . ",1
"Hello , Tom . Where are you heading for ? ",2
" I am going to a movie theater . You know there is a new action film produced by Hollywood . A thriller , really . ",1
 Another terror film ? There is too much terror and violence in the films . Do you like seeing such a picture ? ,2
" I don't really like seeing bloody frames , but I appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects . ",1
Did you go to the concert last weekend ? ,2
" No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ? ",2
" Yes . I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . ",1
 How much was the ticket ? ,2
 I only paid two dollars for mine . ,1
Mary and Tom are breaking up . ,1
 It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ? ,2
" Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman . ",1
 Do you think they'll become reconciled ? ,2
" No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage . ",1
 What a shame ! Their marriage is really a mistake . ,1
have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ? ,2
 sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality . ,1
" as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ? ",2
" to begin with , I have to use chopsticks . ",1
 but you look quite proficient in using them now . ,1
" certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch ",1
" yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm i ",2
 anything strang about that ? ,2
" maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present . ",1
" oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks . ",1
It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck . ,1
 Don't be so angry . It's passed anyway . ,1
 I can't forget it . ,1
 You'd better cool yourself down first . ,1
"Let's program your courses . Since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction.You transcript indicate that your English background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it . ",3
 How many credits for each course ? ,2
" Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department . ",3
" Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will . ",4
I hate to go outside . ,1
 Me too . ,1
 Why do you hate to go outside ? ,2
 I meet too many jerks . ,1
 I agree . ,1
 This city is full of jerks . ,1
 Rude people are everywhere . ,1
 But what can you do ? ,2
 You can yell at them . ,1
 And they will yell back at you . ,1
 Yelling doesn't do any good . ,1
 No . The best thing to do is just stay home . ,1
"I had to announce his innocence in court today , but it left a nasty taste in my mouth . ",1
 You mean you suspect him . ,1
 I ’ m not sure . I ’ ll try to prove my feeling . ,1
 I hope I can do something for you . ,1
Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature . ,1
 You do ? ,2
" Yeah , those classics from the great writers . ",1
 But I find Japanese ones better . ,1
Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not . ,1
 Why doesn't he ask her ? ,2
 He is too scared to ask her . ,1
 He's a chicken guy . ,1
Good morning . ,1
 Good morning . ,1
 What does the paper say ? ,2
 Nothing much — the same old stuff . A lot of bad news as usual . ,1
" Well , what ’ s the weather report ? ",2
" Sunny and mild today , cloudy and rainy tomorrow . ",1
 Did they find those bank robbers ? ,2
" Not yet . They were holding two men in Ohio , but they let them go . They weren ’ t the criminals after all . ",1
 What about the sports page ? What were the scores of last night ’ s games ? ,2
 Here ’ s the paper ; you can read them yourself . ,1
I would wondering if you like to stay here for a few days . ,2
 It really depends on when and how long ,1
 Until next weekend . that ’ s ok . ,1
They ’ ll do the operation for you this Friday . ,1
 But Saturday is my birthday . ,1
 I think it ’ s important to do now . We can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital . ,3
 But it won ’ t be on my birthday . ,4
 But your health is more important . Believe me ! ,1
I hate computer games . ,1
 Why ? They are fine . ,2
 Because they are too violent . Some of them are even disgusting . ,1
 Indeed there are bad games . But many of them are good . ,1
" If boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad . ",1
 Come on . Things are not so bad . Boys can learn to use the computer through games . ,1
"Are you free this weekend , Miss Rose ? ",2
" Yes , I am . What's up ? ",2
 Then would you please go to a dance party with me ? ,3
 With pleasure . I suppose you dance often . ,4
" Oh , no . As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time . ",1
 But I am told that you dance wonderfully well . ,1
" Thanks for flattering me . I think you dance a lot , right ? ",2
 No . Just occasionally . ,1
 What's your favorite dance ? ,2
" It's hard to say , but I do love the foxtrot and waltz . ",1
 How about rock'n'roll ? ,2
" To tell you the truth , I don't like it . It's too noisy . ",1
 And the tango ? ,2
" Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't do it well . ",1
 Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can do it very well . Then I'll meet you at six . Is that at all right ? ,3
 OK . ,4
 Great ! I'm your lucky fellow then . ,1
"You are an outgoing person , quite easy to talk with . ",1
" Yes , my friends like to get along with me well . ",1

"Doris , Helen Mall is having a big sale this weekend . Do you wanna go ? ",3
 Don't feel like it . I'm broke . ,4
" Well , we can still do some window shopping , can we ? ",3
" Just look around ? Nah , that ’ s boring . ",4
 I'll go by myself then . ,1
"I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day . ",3
" Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink . ",4
 How about the new bar across the road ? ,3
 Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too . ,4
" I agree , I had lunch there last week . ",1
 Excellent ! That sounds like a plan . ,1
"Hello , are you Chinese ? ",2
" No , I'm Korean . Where are you from ? ",2
 I'm from America . Are you settling in all right ? ,2
 I've already found a flat and it's quite comfortable . What about you ? ,2
 I live in my uncle's house . He came here ten years ago . ,1
 What do you think of the local accent here ? Has it been causing you any problems ? ,2
 I think it's just a matter of getting used to it . ,1
 I can't agree more . ,1
Why don't you watch where you're going ? ,2
 Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me ! ,2
 There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in . ,1
" Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me . ",1
 I think my arm is broken . ,1
" Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too . ",1
" Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was . ",3
 Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried . ,4
" I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ? ",3
 Alright . ,4
 It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . ,3
" Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital . ",4
 Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . ,1
" Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time . ",1
 It really hurts . ,1
" Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ? ",2
 To hell with you . The accident was your fault . ,1
" I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ? ",2
 To hell with you . ,1
"Bill , do you know if the cafeteria around the corner's open today ? ",2
 Yes . They were open this morning when I came to work . They must've finished remodeling . Why do you want to know ? ,2
" Well , I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . That is , if you haven't promised to go with someone else . ",1
" That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning . ",1
 I'm sorry I was such a grouch . It must've been the weather . When it rains I get depressed . ,1
 Forget it . I'll see you at 11:30 am . ,1
The stepmother was very wicked . She couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face . ,1
 And ? ,2
 And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy . ,1
 Poor child ! ,1
Sorry . I didn't mean to be late . Can I come in ? ,3
 What's your excuse this time ? ,2
 Have I used the one that my sister is sick ? ,2
" Yes , twice last week . ",1
 Are you sure ? I thought I said it was my mother . ,2
 I don't think so . But it could've been . ,1
 Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die . ,1
" I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ? ",2
 I'll do my best . ,1
 Just try to be a little more punctual in the future . ,3
 I'm working on it . Really ! ,4
"Hi , Becky , what's up ? ",2
" Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . ",1
 What's the problem ? ,2
 She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around . ,1
 For example ? ,2
" Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . ",1
" No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . ",1
 It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . ,1
" My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . ",1
"Ella , it's been such a long week . I'm ready to go out and party . Hey , let's go out for a night on the town . ",3
" Gosh , you took all the word right out of my mouth . Let's go out and get crazy tonight . ",4
 Let's go to the new club on West Street . ,3
" Sure , but what do I wear ? ",2
 You can wear that pretty red dress . ,3
"Hi , Alice , what are you doing this sunday ? ",2
" Nothing really , why , what ' s up ? ",2
" If you are free , maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . It will be fun , you will get to know lots of people . ",3
" Sounds great , I'd very much like to accept your invitation , thanks , when ? ",2
 Around six pm . ,1
 Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating . ,2
" No . thank you . I can handle it , but thanks for the offer . ",1
" Ok , I will see you then . ",3
" Great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer . ",4
Hello.this is Susan . ,1
" Hello , I ’ m Mark . I ’ m just wondering if you are free this weekend ",2
" Yes , I think So . ",1
 Good . I was thinking that I ’ d like to invite you to watch a movie . I can meet you at the cinema gate . ,3
 What ’ s the time ? ,2
" Six thirty , tonight . ",1
" Oh , I ’ m sorry I can ’ t because I have to do some housework.You can ask Jenny to go with you ",4
 All right.Maybe next time I can go with you.Bye ! ,1
 Good bye ! ,1
What is life ? ,2
 Don't ask such a question . You know it has no certain answer . Everyone knows it is in his heart . ,1
 Then do you think that life is arranged by something above us . ,2
" Maybe , the whirligig of time , who knows ? ",2
 Right . ,1
"David , I ’ m going to China . ",1
 Really ? How did you get the chance ? ,2
 You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ’ t have to pay for my trip . ,1
 Congratulations . How lucky you are ! ,1
 Thank you . I ’ m leaving tomorrow morning . ,1
 I ’ m sure you ’ ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country . ,1
 I ’ m sure I will . ,1
" Have a nice journey , Lily . ",1
" Thank you , David . ",1
Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won ! ,2
" Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . ",1
" Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . ",1
" He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him . ",1
 Me too . ,1
" Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out . ",1
" Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? ",2
" Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited . ",1
" He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him . ",1
 And the host announced that he won it all ! ,1
"Come in , come in ! ",3
" Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? ",2
 I thought we were supposed to meet here . ,1
 Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . ,2
 I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other . ,1
 Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? ,2
 You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie . ,3
 It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . ,4
"Excuse me , i am a new student here . Could you tell me where the English Department is ? ",2
" It is in that brand new , tall building over there . On the 9th floor . ",1
 Where is the school cafeteria ? ,2
 It is the basement of that red building in front of the tower with big bells . ,1
 Where is the Computer Center ? ,2
 The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library . ,1
 Where is the library ? ,2
 The library is next to the Adminstration Building . The Adminstration Building is over there near the school ’ s main entrance . There are school maps for free in the lobby of the Admin . ,1
 Thank you . I will go get one . ,1
" Sure . Glad to be of service . By the way , my name is Mike Sullivan . You will see me around a lot . I am running for President of the Student Government . ",1
" Well , hi ! My name is Eve Markowski . I am glad to meet you . With your friendly smile and helpful attitude . I am sure you will win . ",1
 Thanks you for the encouragement . ,1
 You are welcome . I ’ d better go . Goodbye . ,1
 Have a good day . Bye-Bye ! ,1
How about another beer ? ,3
" No , thanks . I've had more than enough.In fact , I must be running along . ",4
 Stay around for a while.The party is warming up . ,3
 I'm afraid I have to leave . I have to be up early tomorrow . ,4
We have another traditional holiday-the Dragon Boat Festival . ,1
 When is it ? ,2
 It falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month . ,1
 Could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ? ,2
" OK . The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river . ",1
 Why do people eat rice cakes on that day ? ,2
 In order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body . ,1
 It sounds so moving . ,1
"Nice to see you , Patrick . ",1
 Bob ! I hear your team won the match . ,1
 Yeah . All of us tried our best . ,1
 Congratulations ! ,1
I think you're being a little naive . ,1
" If I want , I can protect myself by paying through an escrow account , which holds the money until I receive the item . ",1
 That proves my point ! Protect yourself or you'll get burned . ,1
 eBay also offers free insurance . You can get a refund of up to $ 200 if you're not satisfied with your purchase . ,1
" $ 200 ? If they get a hold of your credit card number , you're going to be out a lot more than $ 200 ! I had a friend who ... ",1
Your knowledge of English is really surprising . ,1
" Oh , it's nothing to speak of . ",1
" No , seriously . I am impressed . ",1
 Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . ,1
Hello ? ,1
 Hey Tina . What are you doing ? ,2
 I was just watching TV . What's going on with you ? ,2
 I just watched a movie and I'm scared . ,1
 What did you watch ? ,2
 I saw the Sixth Sense . I didn't know it was going to be so scary . ,1
 I remember that . It was a great movie . But it was definitely scary . ,1
" If you're not busy , do you want to come over ? I'm afraid to be alone . ",3
 Sure . I can come over . What should we do ? ,4
 How about if we watch a comedy . I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense . ,3
 Ok . I'll get ready and leave . I'll see you in about 20 minutes . ,4
" Hurry , ok . It's dark out . ",1
" Don't worry , nothings going to happen . I'll be there real soon . ",1
 Ok . See you soon . ,1
are you a blogger ? ,2
 sure I am . I've been writing a blog for almost three years . ,1
" oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ? ",2
 I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides . ,1
 what do you usually write about ? ,2
" at first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an ",1
 that's interesting . How often do you write a blog ? ,2
" it's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks . ",1
 got it . Are you still updating your blog ? ,2
" sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like . ",1
 good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months . ,1
Have you found a new job yet ? ,2
" No , not yet . I ’ m still looking . I ’ Ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though . ",1
 What kind of work ? ,2
 I ’ m temping at a pharmaceutic company . ,1
 What do you do there ? ,2
 Mostly office work - filing and so on . ,1
 How long is the assignment ? ,2
 Till the end of the month . ,1
This is just for you . Cheers ! Bottoms up . ,1
 En ... it tastes good . I appreciate what you have done for me . ,1
"I'm sorry , ladies . Mr . Smith's viewing is over . It ended an hour ago . ",1
 But we just drove across town . Can't we just go in to see him one last ... ,3
" I'm afraid not . But at tomorrow's funeral , the family requested an open casket service . ",4
" This is all too fast . He's my best friend , and now he's gone . ",1
 I'm sorry . I know it must have come as a great shock . ,1
" The viewing was for saying goodbye , and I didn't even get that . ",1
I can ’ t bear it . The driver is too bad . ,1
 He must be green . It ’ s lucky that we will get off soon . ,1
I prefer potatoes to eggplants . ,1
 I feel eggplants are more nutritious . ,1
" But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better . ",1
" Oh , that's how you see it . ",1
That way they look longer . ,1
 Now what are you doing ? ,2
 Putting on mascara . ,1
 Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes . ,3
 I won't . ,4
 And you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face . ,1
Let's have some lunch ; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere ? ,2
" Yes , I'm hungry . What types of food sound good ? ",2
" Maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something . ",1
 I have a great idea of where you might like to go . ,1
 Can we walk there ? ,2
 It's on the second floor . May I join you ? ,3
 Of course ! Let's go . ,4
 Let's hurry . I'm starving ! ,3
What are you going to do next year ? ,2
 I want to go traveling . ,1
 Do you have any where in mind ? ,2
" Yes , I've been thinking about Florida . ",1
"Like a cat on hot bricks , as you might say . I don ’ t believe you are listening at all . ",1
" Sorry , I just worried about him . You know , he should be here an hour ago . ",1
" Don ’ t worry him , he has been grown up and I think he can take himself very well . ",1
 But he still does not come back . ,1
 Maybe he is on the way home now . ,1
How long have you been in England ? ,2
 For almost two years . ,1
 Almost two years ? Your English is very good . ,2
 Thank you . But there's still a lot for me to learn . ,1
"The Johnson are on their way back.You remember them , don't you ? ",2
 Johnson ? I can't place them . ,2
 We met them in Bermuda last May . ,1
 They've completely slipped my mind . ,1
" The couple with the dogs , think back . ",1
" No , I don't recall a thing about them . ",1
" Well , I've invited them for brunch . ",1
" Hmm , I must be getting absent-minded . ",1
His grandfather is the richest person in the area . ,1
 What a miser ! He cycles to school every day . ,1
 His grandfather's money is not his . ,1
 I can't understand him anyway . ,1
What did he say ? ,2
 He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man . ,1
" It ’ s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man . ",1
" Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know . ",1
"I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat.oh , there he is . ",1
" hey , Isabelle ... ",1
 Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . ,2
" yes , I am the guy ... ",1
 what a bummer ! You set me up ? ,2
 let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... ,1
We are just going round the corner for a drink . Won't you join us ? ,3
" Well , I'd like to , but I am not sure I have time . ",4
" Oh , come on ! Just a quick one ! ",3
" All right , just a quick one . ",4
Excuse me Miao Li . Could you tell me who Jackie Chan is ? ,2
 Certainly . Jackie Chan is a very famous movie star in Hong Kong . His Chinese name is Cheng Long . ,1
" Ha , I know Cheng Long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . And at that time he was promoted as the new Bruce Lee . But I'm not familiar with his English name . ",1
 OK . Then tell me what else you know . ,1
 Some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . Do you know how Jackie Chan measures his worth ? ,2
" He measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . By the way , can you count the breaks ? ",2
" Sure . His skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul-der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . As he said ' Everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! ' ",1
 Indeed you know much about him . ,1
 This is because he is the action-movie incarnate or action-star extraordinaire around the world . ,1
"I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me . ",1
" Oh , that's all right . ",1
 I must apologize . I'll buy you a new one tomorrow . ,1
" No , please don't . I couldn't let you do that . ",1
May I ask a question ? ,3
" Yes , what's it ? ",4
 What does mph stand for ? ,2
 It's miles per hour . ,1
"Look , that bamboo groves are flourishing . Let's go and play there . ",1
" Wait ! Look at that board , what's on it ? ",2
 ' Please don't enter the bamboo groves . ' We're not allowed to go in . ,1
 Then we'd better not go . ,1
 OK . ,1
Are you ready to go shopping ? ,2
 Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet . ,1
 What research ? ,2
 Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ? ,2
 But they're just ads . ,1
" Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends . ",1
Is there anything worth watching on another channel ? ,2
 I think there ’ s a Western on . ,1
 Do you mind if we watch it . I ’ d really like to see it . ,3
" Well , I really wanted to see the football game . ",3
" Football game ? Ok , and you know what comes on next ? ",2
 I believe there ’ s a sitcom . ,1
 Are you interested in watching it ? ,2
 Let me look in the TV Guide first . ,1
" Oh , I am sorry . What's on Channel 2 at 10 pm ? ",2
" If I remember correctly , it's a quiz show . ",1
 Do you want to watch it ? ,2
 Let's watch it together . ,3
"Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ? ",2
 It was funny . ,1
" Tell me about it , will you ? ",2
" Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight . ",1
 Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ? ,2
" Sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . ",1
 You were lucky then . What did you do after that ? ,2
 We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan . ,1
 So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday . ,1
" Yes , you're right . And I was so tired that I fell asleep on the way back . My arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday . ",1
Susan is going to get a divorce . ,1
 How do you know that ? ,2
" She told me that Peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage . ",1
" Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it . ",1
Here's the course description guide . ,1
 What do I do with it ? ,2
 Do you want me to help you ? ,3
 Please . ,4
 Look . Here are the core classes . Everyone has to take them . ,1
 So I don't have to worry about them . ,1
" You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ... ",3
 I'll take home economics . ,3
 Good . Now you can pick classes by yourself . ,4
"Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of your computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts . ",1
 But I ... I don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills . ,1
 What do you mean ? ,2
" They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that's because they rely on gadgets . ",1
 That's not the gadgets . Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . It engages their imagination and sharpen their mind . ,1
"Ann , do you have time next Monday ? ",2
" Yeah , what ’ s up ? ",2
" Next Monday is my birthday , and I would like you to attend my party . ",3
 Wow . I'd love to . ,4
 Great ! ,1
 When and where ? ,2
" Five o ’ clock that afternoon , and in my place , you know ? ",2
" Yes , I know . I appreciate your invitation . ",1
 I am going to invite other guys . See you that day . ,1
 See you . ,1
Hey Stacy . What's going on ? ,2
 I'm pretty tired these days . ,1
 Why ? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ? ,2
" I have so much house work to do . I have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends . ",1
 How about your husband . Does he help much ? ,2
 Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ? ,1
 That sucks . ,1
" If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ? ",2
 That's crossing the line . ,1
 Oh well . I'll have to live with it . What else can I do ? ,1
Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ? ,2
" Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? ",2
 Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . ,1
" That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems . ",1
 Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? ,2
" When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports . ",1
" I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ? ",2
" Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it . ",1
 Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo . ,1
" Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits . ",1
 You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too . ,1
How do you arrange this summer vacation ? ,2
 I want to travel . ,1
 Where would you like to go ? ,2
 The seaside . ,1
 That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian . ,1
" I ’ Ve been to Qingdao before , so I ’ ll choose Dalian . I've heard that the environment there is very good . ",1
" Yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . Last year I went there . It's really . ",1
 Thank you ! ,1
"Would you care for something to drink , Mr . Stone ? ",3
" No , thank you , Mrs . Carter . I'm fine for now . ",4
 Just make yourself at home . The other guests should be arriving shortly . ,1
I'm dreadfully sorry for you . ,1
 Thank you very much for your kindness . ,1
 Is there any clue ? ,2
" No , he left nothing . ",1
"Very glad to know something about you , then what are you going to do when you finish . ",1
" Oh , I ’ ll go to shanghai to practice there . ",1
 That ’ s a good idea . It must be easy to find a job in shanghai . ,1
" I think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there . ",1
 And English is very useful in your job . ,1
" I think it will be very useful in many ways . Beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in China , but also in the world , English is useful in almost all walks of life . ",1
 You will be a very promising one . ,1
 That ’ s my wish . ,1
I hear you are expecting your family . ,1
" Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well . ",1
 I didn't know you had a brother . ,2
" Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often . ",1
" Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ? ",2
 His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here . ,1
 Does your brother have just one son ? ,2
" No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them . ",1
 I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson . ,1
" Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it . ",1
 So when are they all coming ? ,2
 My parents are already here . My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday . ,1
You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ? ,2
 I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday . ,1
 Where did you spend your holiday ? ,2
 I went to Paris . ,1
"So , Paula , where are you from ? ",2
" I'm from Canada , originally . ",1
 From Canada ? Where were you born ? ,2
 Montreal . ,1
 When did you come to Los Angeles ? ,2
 We moved here when I was fourteen . ,1
 Did you go to school here ? ,2
" Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas . ",1
 Did you get a job right after graduation ? ,2
" No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France . ",1
 When was that ? ,2
 Let's see ... That was about six years ago . ,1
 I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ? ,2
 I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me.How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ? ,2
Do you consider yourself a good mother ? ,2
" Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman . ",1
" How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother . ",2
" I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself . ",1
 Does your husband feel the same ? ,2
 Yes . He is very understanding and supportive . ,1
"I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth . ",1
" let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance . ",3
" I often do , but I ’ m worried about the responses from other people . ",4
" you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion . ",3
 I ’ m worried that what I say will not make sense . ,4
 we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking . ,3
 that ’ s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ? ,2
 that ’ s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle . ,3
 I didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy . ,4
" the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ’ t be sure how . ",1
What's his job ? ,2
 He used to be a policeman . ,1
 But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son . ,1
 Yeah . He's a private eye now . ,1
Bother the flies ! ,1
 Where do they come from ? ,2
 I don't know . Something rotten here ? ,2
 I can't see it . ,1
Have you got your invitation yet ? ,2
" My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ? ",2
 The house warming party . ,1
 Whose house warming party is it ? ,2
 Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house . ,2
" Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately . ",2
 It's out in the suburbs . ,1
 Have you seen the house ? ,2
" Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend . ",1
 Is it nice ? ,2
" Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . ",1
 There's also a garden . ,1
" Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ? ",2
" They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight . ",1
 When are they going to have the party ? ,2
 Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow . ,1
" Wow , that would be something to look forward to . ",1
"hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ? ",3
 I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . ,1
" oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ? ",2
" we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec ",3
 wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait ! ,2
 tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ? ,3
" perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank . ",4
" no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . ",1
" we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning . ",3
" great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain . ",3
 no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week . ,4
" Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us . ",3
"Hi , Kenny . Let's go for a drink . ",3
 Sounds good . Where are we going ? ,2
 Somewhere new . It's a great place to pick up chicks . ,1
" Need a new . girlfriend , huh ? ",2
" Yeah , I broke up with Lisa.She blew a gasket over it . Whoa , get a load of that ! ",1
 Whew ! That getup is terrific ! ,1
 Never mind the getup.She ' s beautiful ! ,1
 That too . ,1
 I'm gonna introduce myself . ,1
" If you're lucky , that might do the trick . ",1
" Oh , oh , that tears it ! I'm getting out of here . ",1
 Hold on ! What's the big hurry ? ,2
" My ex-girlfriend's here.If she sees me , my goose is cooked . ",1
 I wanna finish my drink first . I'll meet you at Sammy's . ,3
" OK , catch you later . ",4
Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how are you ? It ’ s been such a long time ! ,2
" Darlene ! Indeed , it ’ s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ’ Ve done with your hair ! ",2
" Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret ! ",2
" Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ’ Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated ! ",1
" Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know . ",1
 He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course ! ,1
" Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently . ",2
 Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended . ,1
 Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday ! ,1
" But of course ! Well , it ’ s been great talking to you , but I have to get going . ",1
" Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee ! ",1
 That would be great ! Give me a call ! ,3
 See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter . ,4
Did you already take the history exam ? ,2
 Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ? ,2
 I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ? ,2
 Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society . ,3
 What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ? ,2
 I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not . ,1
" Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class . ",1
" If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go . ",3
 Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now . ,4
 Good luck . ,1
 Thanks . See ya . ,1
"What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable . ",2
 It's us . ,1
" What do you mean by "" us "" ? ",2
" Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . Remember ? ",2
" What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ? ",2
" Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together . ",1
 Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ? ,2
 Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ? ,1
"Hey , Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ? ",2
 Yes.Do you like it ? ,2
 It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent . ,1
 Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it . ,2
 Is classical music your favorite ? ,2
 Yes . What about you ? ,2
 I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it . ,1
 Pop music doesn't have any depth for me . ,1
" Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it . ",1
 Did you always like pop music . ,2
" I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music . ",1
 I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life . ,1
" oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play . ",2
" Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy . ",1
It was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young . ,1
 Most people were living form hand to mouth . How could they ? ,2
 Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things . ,1
" Fortunately , things are changing these years . ",1
"Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon . ",1
" A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ? ",2
" There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me . ",3
 I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day . ,4
 What about sunday ? ,3
" i wish i could , but it's my mums birthday . ",4
 Maybe next week . ,3
" Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work . ",4
" Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat . ",1
" I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime . ",1
"Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ? ",2
" Yeah , I ’ m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains . ",1
" Oh , do you go hiking often ? ",2
 I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature . ,1
 It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? ,2
" Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? ",2
" Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike . ",1
 Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city . ,1
" Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . ",1
" Well , bring him along too . We ’ ll have a great time this weekend . ",3
" Thanks , I ’ ll ask him . ",4
How upsetting ! He has been away for a week ! ,1
 I don't know if anything terrible has happened . ,1
 I have reported it to the police . ,1
 We'd better prepare for the worst . ,1
"You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ? ",2
" He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ? ",2
 I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles . ,1
 I can think of better things to dream about ... ,1
" Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away . ",1
 That's crazy . ,1
Mike ! Look at the floor ! ,1
 What's wrong with it ? ,2
 What's wrong with it ? It's filthy ! ,1
 Oh ... ,1
 It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes . ,1
" Sorry , love . ",1
 What are you looking for now ? ,2
 My cigarettes . ,1
" Well , they ' re not here.They are in the dustbin . ",1
 In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ? ,1
Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at this university ? ,2
" Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad . ",1
 It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing . ,1
 Are you Chinese by birth ? ,2
" Yes , I am . I am from Guangzhou . I am here to study international relations . ",1
 How do you like it ? ,2
 I like it so far . But my English still needs work . ,1
 I want to study Mandarin and public relations . ,1
"Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look . ",3
 Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors . ,4
 Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that . ,1
 Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show . ,1
 You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ? ,2
 They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim . ,1
" Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ? ",2
" Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine . ",1
 Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ? ,2
 It's possible . ,1
You'll never guess what I won at work today ! - Tickets to tonight's final NBA game . ,1
" Two , I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me ! ",1
" Of course ! And here's the best part , they are court side seats ! ",1
 How in the world ! Who came up with seats like that from your company ? ,2
 Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team ! ,1
 Can't beat that ! Thank you accounting guy ! ,1
" The game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five . ",3
 What are we waiting for ? Let's go ! ,4
Let ’ s play a game ! ,3
 OK ! How about Scrabble ? ,3
" No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is ! ",3
 OK ! ,4
" Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples ! ",1
" Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! ",1
" Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald ! ",1
 Your future husband ! ,1
 Not funny . ,1
"As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives . ",1
" It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points . ",1
 Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone . ,2
" For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study . ",1
 That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones . ,1
" Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them . ",1
"Lee , I'm going to get married next month . ",1
 Good news ! And congratulations ! ,1
 You are invited to my wedding . ,3
 Thank you . I'll certainly be there . ,4
Thank you for lending me the book . ,1
" Sure . But it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow . ",3
 But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel . I only look up the most necessary ones . ,1
Don ’ t you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers ? ,2
 I ’ m afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it . ,1
" Don ’ t you think in that case , there wouldn ’ t be so much stealing ? ",2
 Definitely . But I think it is too fierce . ,1
"The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ? ",2
" Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close . ",1
 That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ? ,2
 It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ? ,2
 Yeah . I think I can find it . ,1
 You're back already . That sure was quick . ,1
 That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me . ,1
" Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time . ",1
" Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway . ",3
" Okay , let's go ! ",4
"hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ? ",2
" well , I spend a lot of time watching movies . ",1
" what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too . ",1
" oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ? ",2
" actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ? ",2
" art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too . ",1
 really impressive . These two genres are totally different . ,1
 sure . I enjoy both of them very much . ,1
 how often do you go to the cinema ? ,2
" once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon . ",1
 movie salon ? where is that ? ,2
 it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . I've got a membership there . ,1
 is it good ? ,2
" yes , you can find almost all new releases there . ",1
 really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership . ,2
 why not ? ,1
Hey Suzie . Guess what ? I'm having a baby ! ,1
 Really ? That's so great . Congratulations . ,1
 Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now . ,1
 That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ? ,2
 Three months . ,1
 Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ? ,2
" I want to , but Bob doesn't . He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way . ",1
 Maybe it's more exciting not knowing . ,1
 I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time . ,1
 There are so many things you have to prepare for . ,1
" I know I am going to be busy , but I know I can handle it . I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time . ",1
 It really must be an exciting time for you guys . ,1
 Thank you so much . ,1
Mary seems depressed . What ’ s the matter ? ,2
 She didn ’ t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ’ s hard work . ,1
 Poor girl ! ,1
"Believe it or not , one of the narrowest street in the world is only 49cm wide . ",1
 Unbelievable ! How do people go through it ? ,2
" That's what I'm wondering , too . ",1
 I wish I had a chance to see it with my own eyes . ,1
Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ? ,3
" Much to my regret , I'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then . ",4
" We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ? ",3
" Much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time . ",4
 What a pity ! You can't join us . ,1
" So sorry . Next time we'll go , thanks anyway . ",1
"I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight , do you think have time ? ",3
 Thank you for your inition . I'm free tonight . ,4
" Which kind of food do you like , chinese food , western food or sea food ? ",2
 I prefer sea food . ,3
 ok . I'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm . ,3
 That's fine . I'll be waiting for you . ,4
 See you later . ,1
 bye . ,1
Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already . ,1
" If that happen to me , I ’ ll take them back to the shop . ",1
 I did . But they said they won ’ t change them . ,1
" That ’ s terrible . But if they wouldn ’ t change them , I know what I would do . ",1
Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? ,2
 Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it . ,1
 Totally agree . What is your solution ? ,2
" Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . ",1
 You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . ,1
 It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . ,1
" But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . ",1
" I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team . ",1
I am so busy today . ,1
 Can I help you ? ,3
 I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping . ,3
 I ’ ll be glad to help . ,4
 Or maybe make the beds . ,3
 All you have to do is ask for help . ,4
 Thanks . That ’ s terrific ! ,1
 I ’ m ready and willing to help . ,1
"The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening . ",1
 Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ? ,2
 Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them . ,1
 Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ? ,3
" I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves . ",4
 You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different . ,1
You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work . ,1
 I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today . ,1
 Do you feel ok ? ,2
" Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu . ",1
 Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now . ,3
 Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ? ,3
 You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down . ,4
" Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting . ",4
" Zach , what's that on your arm ? ",2
" I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing . ",1
 It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ? ,2
" Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks . ",1
 I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go . ,3
 Shouldn't we make an appointment first ? ,2
" We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse . ",1
 Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting ! ,4
I can't go to your party . ,1
 That's too bad . ,1
Do you like being a doctor ? ,2
" Yes , most of the time . But , sometimes things can get difficult . ",1
 Can you tell me about it ? ,2
" You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not . ",1
 What can you do when this happens ? ,2
" Not much , usually I'll just keep silent . ",1
Have you eaten ? ,2
 Not yet . ,1
It's too hot to read . ,1
 We'd better go out for a walk . ,3
 Which season do you like best ? ,2
 Spring . ,1
 How about summer ? ,2
 I dislike it most . ,1
 Why ? ,2
 Because the hottest season is summer in a year . ,1
 But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons . ,1
My son came home from three years in the navy . ,1
 It was a real red letter day for you . ,1
 Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home . ,1
"John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? ",2
" Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ? ",2
" It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day . ",1
" You forgot all of about it , didn't you ? ",2
I must be going . ,3
 Okay . Keep in touch . ,4
"Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox . ",1
" I ’ m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment . ",1
" I don ’ t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ? ",2
" Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars . ",1
 But the reservation keeps the car here . That ’ s why you have the reservation . ,1
 I know why we have reservations . ,1
" I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them . ",1
 But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ’ d like . ,1
 Fine . I ’ ll take the compact . ,1
" Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ? ",2
" Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car . ",1
Do you think Tom will be elected president ? ,2
" No , I think Harry will get it . ",1
 Let's make a bet on who gets it . ,3
" OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night . ",4
I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday . ,1
" Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer . ",1
" You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ? ",1
" To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . ",1
" But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive . ",1
What happened ? Why didn't he win ? ,2
 Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified . ,2
 How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! ,2
" If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . ",1
 What ? What kind of drugs was he using ? ,2
 He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . ,1
 I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . ,1
 They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . ,1
 That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . ,1
" I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! ",1
" Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . ",1
" I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . ",1
 Let's hope so . ,1
"Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ? ",2
 That's because Americans love sitcoms . ,1
 Sitcoms ? ,2
" Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values . ",1
" In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies . ",1
 I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time . ,1
Are you interested in history ? ,2
" Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . ",1
" I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . ",1
 I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks ! ,1
 Some people say that history repeats itself . ,1
" What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ? ",2
" The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . ",1
 I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again . ,1
You're looking great . ,1
" You , too . ",1
"What's the matter , John ? you seemed to be restless today . ",2
" You see , I've been offered a new job . I can't decide whether to take it or not . ",1
" Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice . ",1
 It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging . ,1
 Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ? ,2
" Yes , they say I would get a big sum . ",1
 Have you discussed it with your wife ? ,2
" Yes , she leaves it to me . ",1
 As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary . ,3
 I have to think about it . ,4
Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ? ,2
" Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L . ",1
 Of course . ,1
I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0.1 of a second . ,1
 That ’ s great . He ’ s the best runner I ’ Ve seen this season . I ’ m sure he ’ ll win a medal at the Olympics . ,1
 I think you ’ re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ’ ll win ? ,2
" I really don ’ t know . I don ’ t think we ’ ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones . ",1
 What do you think our chance are in other events . ,2
" In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ’ ll do well in those same events . ",1
 We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice . ,1
 I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total . ,1
 You are very optimistic ! ,1
"Helen , did you hear I ’ m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place . ",3
" I may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me . ",4
" Well , drop by if you can . ",1
" I will , do you want me to bring anything ? ",2
" No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there . ",3
It's said that John's broken up . ,1
 Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot . ,2
 I hear that John's leading a double wife . ,1
 It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife . ,1
Let's play chess . ,3
 I haven't played chess for a long time . ,4
" That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play . ",1
" Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing . ",1
 You're a very good player ,1
" Not really , but once I won a prize . ",1
 So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners . ,1
 My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously . ,3
You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? ,2
" Yeah , about . ",1
 Do you know Chinese better now ? ,2
" Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . ",1
" Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere . ",1
" I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . ",1
 A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it . ,1
 I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time . ,1
" Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us . ",1
" Yes , absolutely true . ",1
"Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ? ",2
 Harry Potter . ,1
 Harry Potter ? Is that book funny ? ,2
" Actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that's funny . ",1
 Got it . ,1
 Have you ever read this book before ? ,2
" No , but my little brother likes it very much . ",1
 It's really a good book . You will like it too . ,3
" I'll try to read it . Actually , I like literature very much . ",4
" Wow , that sounds like a scholar . By the way , who's your favorite writer ? ",2
 Jane Austen . ,1
 Me too . Pride and Prejudice is my favorite . ,1
 I like it too . But Sense and Sensibility is my favorite . ,1
"Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren . ",1
" Thanks , Tim.Nice meeting you , too . ",1
 I guess we'll see just around . ,3
" Ye , I hope so.well.Take it easy . ",3
 You too . ,4
"Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious ! ",2
 I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit ! ,1
 But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you ! ,1
 Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles ! ,1
 What kind of power struggles are you talking about ? ,2
" Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career ! ",1
 So he talks about you behind your back ? ,2
 Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back ! ,1
 I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas . ,1
 I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort . ,1
" My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO . ",1
"Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! ",1
 What is it ? What happened ? ,2
 I think someone is stalking me . ,1
" No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? ",1
" I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . ",1
 What did you do ? ,2
" I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . ",1
 Did he leave when you left ? ,2
 Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . ,1
 What did you do ? ,2
"Man , I'm hungry . Do you know a good place to have lunch ? ",2
" Yes , I know a great place . What types of food do you like ? ",2
" Mexican , Japanese or Chinese would be great . ",1
" Oh , I know a place where you might like to eat . ",1
 Is it close by ? ,2
 It's down a block on the right ; can I show you the way ? ,3
" OK , I'd love the company . ",4
 This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it . ,1
have you ever been to Disneyworld ? ,2
" when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? ",2
" the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland . ",1
 that's right . Why do you ask ? ,2
" well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon . ",1
 when are you getting married ? ,2
 some time next year . We haven't set the date yet . ,1
 congratulations ! I had no idea . ,1
 thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ? ,2
 do you like amusement parks ? ,2
" for the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though . ",1
" if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time . ",1
 even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ? ,2
" even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun . ",1
 thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight . ,1
 I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! ,1
Matthew ? Hi ! ,2
 Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ? ,2
 It's got to be almost a year now . ,1
 How have you been ? ,2
 I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it . ,1
" Yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ? ",2
 Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck . ,1
" Well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ? ",2
 Mrs . Thou ? ,2
" Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . ",3
 Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days ! ,4
 I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ? ,2
Are you ready to go to the mall ? ,2
 Yeah . Dig my new pants ? ,2
 Copycat ! ,1
 What do you mean ? ,2
" You went out and bought khakis , too ! ",1
 No . Mine are a soft brown . Yours are khaki . ,1
 Whatever . ,1
Have heard of Paul ? ,2
" No , what ? ",2
 He's got a promotion . ,1
 You're kidding . ,1
" No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells . ",1
 I don't believe it.He is only being with the company for two years . ,1
" Well , it's true.The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul . ",1
 Well.Good for him . ,1
"Jeff , I'm going to the supermarket . Do you want to come with me ? ",3
 I think the supermarket is closed now . ,4
" Oh , When does it close ? ",2
 It closes at 7:00 on Sundays . ,1
 That's too bad . ,1
" Don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . It opens at 8: 00 . ",3
 Alright . What do you want to do now ? ,2
 Let's take a walk for a half an hour . My sister will get here at about 8: 30PM and then we can all go out to dinner . ,3
 Where does she live ? ,2
 She lives in San Francisco . ,1
 How long has she lived there ? ,2
 I think she's lived there for about 10 years . ,1
 That's a long time . Where did she live before that ? ,2
 San Diego . ,1
"Hey , Peter , have you had lunch yet ? ",2
 No . How about you ? ,2
 Not yet . Let's go to that restaurant on the corner . ,1
Who's that ? ,2
 Search me . ,1
I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me . ,1
 What did you argue about ? ,2
 He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet . ,1
" Well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair . ",1
" Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry . ",1
 Did you lend him a lot of money ? ,2
" Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back . ",1
" Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ? ",2
" No , we didn ’ t . I guess you ’ re right . We should patch things up . ",1
" Of course you should . You wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ? ",2
Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy . ,2
 I don ’ t think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking . ,1
 Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good . ,1
" No , you can ’ t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres . ",1
Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ? ,2
 Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world . ,1
 They must be amazing animals . ,1
 They are . I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea . ,1
 I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men . ,1
 They sure can . Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes . ,1
"Oh dear , my weight has gone up again . ",1
" I am not surprised , you eat too much . ",1
 And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help . ,1
" No , I wouldn't think so . ",1
 I do wish I could lose weight . ,1
" Well , why don't you go on the diet ? ",3
 I've tried diets before but they've never worked . ,4
 Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class . ,3
" Yes , maybe I should . ",4
Could you please wait for a minute ? I'll buy the tickets ,3
 All right . ,4
 Here is your ticket . ,1
 Thank you . ,1
 The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now . ,3
 Really ? ,2
" Yes , let's go in . ",3
" It is a new park , isn't it ? ",2
" Yes , how do you know ? ",2
 I guessed it . ,1
" Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well . ",1
" Oh , how wonderful ! ",1
I was just watching a documentary on TV about how people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting . ,1
" I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers . ",1
 The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow . ,1
 Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation . ,1
 Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts . ,1
 Can you ride a horse ? ,2
" Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ? ",2
 I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? ,3
 What a good idea ! ,4
Where's Mrs . Johnson ? ,2
" Just call her Lisa , Mary . She's cooking dinner . ",3
 I see . Can I sit down ? ,3
 Of course ! Make yourself at home . ,4
" Thank you , Mr . Johnson . ",1
" Please , just call me Tom . ",3
" Okay , Tom . ",4
 Where's Cindy ? ,2
 She's upstairs in my room . ,1
 Can you tell her to come downstairs ? We're about to have dinner . ,3
Have you heard of Paul ? ,2
" No , what ? ",2
 He's got a promotion . ,1
 You're kidding . ,1
" No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells . ",1
" Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years . ",1
" Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul . ",1
 Well . Good for him . ,1
Let's speed up . We're going to be late again . ,1
" If we hurry , can we get there in time ? ",2
 I hope so . ,1
Is it your first time to join the sports meeting of Junior High School ? ,2
" Yes , and it's great . What are the events at the sports meeting ? ",2
" Long-distance race , dash , hurdle race , relay race , standing long jump , high jump , shotput and so on . ",1
" Our neighbor , Bruce , will take part in the relay race . Let's go have a look . ",3
" OK , let's go . ",4
" The competition will begin in 5 minutes , it's tense here . ",1
" Wonderful , Bruce is taking the lead . ",1
 Other competitors have almost caught up with him . They are neck and neck . ,1
" Come on , Bruce . Come on , Bruce . ",1
" Wow , Bruce crossed the line first . ",1
Tim ’ s smiles are interesting . ,1
" Yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful . ",1
 You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him . ,1
 How wonderful it would be if I had such smiles ! ,1
Have you enjoyed your weekend ? ,2
" Yes , it's been marvelous . It really was very kind of you to invite me . I hope it hasn't been too much trouble . ",1
 Not at all . We've really enjoyed having you . I hope you'll come and stay again next time you're in Changsha . ,1
The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors . ,1
 It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it . ,1
 Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon . ,1
 That's true . ,1
I ’ m forming a music band . ,1
 Do you already know how to play an instrument ? ,2
" Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band . ",1
" Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? ",2
" We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ? ",2
" Yes , I ’ m a singer . ",1
 Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house . ,3
" Great ! Wait here ? You don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ? ",4
What would you like for Christmas ? ,2
 I would like to have that new style Gl Joe . ,1
 Have you asked Santa ? ,2
 Yes and I've written him a letter . ,1
"Lili , let ’ s take a vacation ! ",3
" George , how can we ? Vacations cost money . And this month we don ’ t have much money left after paying the rent . ",2
" Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ’ t cost much . ",3
" Where will we sleep , then ? ",2
 In the van . ,1
 What about other expenses ? ,2
" Let ’ s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ’ t we ? ",2
 Maybe you ’ re right . When do you plan to go ? ,2
 The sooner the better ! I can ’ t wait ! ,1
" Oh , I don ’ t know where we ’ re going yet . ",1
" As long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time . ",1
 Let ’ s go to Chicago.We can have lunch in Chinatown.Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field ! ,3
 You have such good ideas ! ,4
What date will our field trip be on ? ,2
 The science field trip is next Monday at 8 o'clock in the morning . Do you want to make note of that on your calendar ? ,2
" Yes , I will make note of that . ",1
" Next Monday is December 2nd . The buses will leave at 8 , but we must begin loading at 7 ",1
 I will be there half an hour early . ,1
 You might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on December 8th . Do you have a ride ? ,2
" Yes , someone is picking me up . ",1
 To get back to campus by 8 ,3
" Not at the moment — maybe later , though . ",4
 All of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway . See you on Monday ! ,3
The acting of this film is marvelous in spite of the thin plot . ,1
 I'm sorry for hero . ,1
 I don't think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts . ,1
 Don't be too critical . We can't expect it to be perfect . ,1
How was your business trip ? ,2
 Great - they wined and dined us all week . ,1
Nice to meet you here.How come you dropped into this company today ? ,2
 My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office . I didn't know you were working here.What a surprise.How long have you been doing this ? ,2
 Two years or so . ,1
 That is great.Do you have to work the night shift ? ,2
" No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week . ",1
 Do you enjoy work here ? ,2
" It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy . ",1
 Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job . ,1
 Luckily not.The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss . ,1
 Glad to hear that . ,1
Scientists have found a second solar system in the universe . ,1
 What's the second solar system ? ,2
" It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it . ",1
 Is this good news or bad news ? ,2
" It's exciting news ! If we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth ! ",1
 You mean with people on it ? ,2
 Yes ! Isn't that exciting ? ,2
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? ,2
" Sorry , I thought you knew . ",1
 But you should tell me you were in love with her . ,1
 Didn't I ? ,2
 You know you didn't . ,1
" Well , I am telling you now . ",1
" Yes , but you might have told me before . ",1
 I didn't think you would be interested . ,1
 You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? ,2
" Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . ",1
" Oh , you men ! You are all the same . ",1
How was the movie last night ? ,2
 I didn't really like it . ,1
 Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . ,1
 I found it very disappointing . ,1
" She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . ",1
 I wasn't happy with it . ,1
 Nothing is to your satisfaction . ,1
"Honey , I ’ ll be right back ! ",1
 Where are you going ? ,2
 I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done . ,1
" Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? ",2
" Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me ! ",1
 Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that ! ,2
" They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish ! ",1
" Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do . ",1
Good afternoon ! ,1
" Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ? ",2
" I'm very well , thank you.How are you ? ",2
" Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ? ",2
" Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot . ",1
 Yes . ,1
 What's the weather like in your country ? ,2
 Mm ... It's quite warm now . ,1
 Where do you live ? ,2
 In London.Where do you live ? ,2
 Here.Near this school . ,1
I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! ,1
 So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? ,2
" That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! ",1
 Have you ever written up a business plan before ? ,2
" Well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? ",2
" You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . ",1
" Well , that seems easy enough . ",1
" Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . ",1
 Geez . Is that all ? ,2
" Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! ",1
 Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! ,1
I hear that Mary got mad . ,1
 So I heard . ,1
 What ’ s wrong with her ? ,2
 She went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident . ,1
"Um , what will you do this weekend ? ",2
 How about a movie ? We haven't done that for a while . ,3
 A movie ? Sure . Do you know what's on right now ? ,2
 No . Why don't you check out the newspaper ? ,3
" Ok . Maybe you should invite your sister along , too . ",4
What ’ s on TV tonight ? ,2
" Not much , that new reality-TV show , Ally McNeal , oooo , Dark Angel . ",1
 Wait a second . I want to watch Ally McNeal . ,3
" Oh , come on . That ’ s such a girl ’ s show . ",4
 No it ’ s not . It ’ s just funny . ,1
" Yeah , if you ’ re a girl . ",1
" Well , you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl . ",1
 That ’ s not true . Dark Angel is a good show . ,1
 It ’ s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits . ,1
" O . K . , O . K . Let ’ s forget it . There ’ s a football game on too . ",3
 No way . I ’ m watching Ally McNeal . Go to John ’ s to watch the game . ,4
It ’ s really terrible ! ,1
 What are you talking about ? ,2
 Don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all . ,1
 You said it . Many parents just don ’ t know how to educate their children . ,1
"Sarah , what did you do today ? ",2
 I went shopping . ,1
 Did you buy anything ? ,2
" Yes , I bought a few things . ",1
 What did you buy ? ,2
 I bought this coat . Do you like it ? ,2
" Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ? ",2
 At the mall on 5th street . ,1
 Was it expensive ? ,2
" No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars . ",1
 That's cheap . ,1
 I know . It was a really good deal . ,1
 I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately . ,1
"Hi , Victor . How are you ? ",2
" Oh , I'm fine . ",1
" So , are you going to go to class tonight ? ",2
 Maybe ... but I don't think so . ,1
 Really ? What's the matter ? ,2
 I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad . ,1
" Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner . ",3
" Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already . ",4
How's John doing ? ,2
 He can barely make ends meet . ,1
The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 . ,1
 They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 . ,1
" If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final . ",1
" No way , if it still has 21 . ",1
What's that book you have under your arm ? ,2
 It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . ,1
 How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn . ,2
 I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day . ,1
 Is it really worth paying for ? ,2
 I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter . ,1
" If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . ",1
"Come on , you are left behind ! ",1
" Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey . ",1
 You just need more exercise . ,1
" Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing ! ",1
 I don't care . I want to burn up my fat . ,1
 But running so fast is not good for people over forties . ,1
 Why ? ,2
 We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us . ,1
 But I want to burn up more calories ! ,1
" In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time . ",1
 Really ? I will slow down then . ,2
"Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ? ",2
" Fine , thank you . I haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ? ",2
" I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films . ",1
" Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary . ",2
" Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them . ",1
" It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one . ",1
 But it's really exciting . ,1
" Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one . ",1
 Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror . ,1
 Yep . ,1
 I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind . ,1
" Maybe . After all , I am grown up now . ",1
"It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession . ",1
 The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports . ,1
" Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . ",1
" It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy . ",1
Are you an art aficionado ? ,2
" Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ? ",2
" I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . ",1
 I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school . ,1
 Art isn ’ t for everyone . I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture . ,1
" I like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ’ d love to go with you . ",2
 I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there . ,3
 That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? ,2
 Let ’ s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits . ,4
"What does your mother do , may I ask ? ",2
 My mother works in a company as an accountant . ,1
 Is she busy ? ,2
" Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year . ",1
"Hello , Bessie . ",1
" Hello , Jack.Happy birthday ! ",1
" My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday . ",2
" I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them . ",1
 Thanks a lot . I'm so touched . ,1
" Now let me sing "" Happy birthday "" for you . ",1
 Thank you very much . ,1
"Nice day , isn't it ? ",2
 It sure is . ,1
 It's a good day for a picnic . ,1
"Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ? ",3
 I don't want to . ,4
" Well , come over and talk to me then . ",3
 Certainly not . ,4
 May I turn on the TV then ? ,3
 Turn on the TV for what ? ,2
 So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . ,3
" Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? ",2
" I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner . ",3
" To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it . ",4
Diane Grant ? I haven't seen you for ages ! ,2
 Brian ! How have you been ? ,2
" Pretty good . Say , you've really changed ! ",1
" Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before . ",1
" Well , you look great ! How are you ? ",2
 I'm doing really well . I got married about three years ago . I have two kids now . ,1
 That's terrific ! ,1
How is your new dormitory ? ,2
" It's very nice . There are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly . ",1
" Well , do you all major in the same subject ? ",2
" No , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating . ",1
 That's great ! ,1
"Peter , how often do you exercise ? ",2
" Well , I swim and run every day . ",1
" Now , tell me , what do you eat ? ",2
" Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs . ",1
 Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? ,2
" Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit . ",1
 What do you drink ? ,2
" Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . ",1
What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? ,2
 We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River . ,3
 How hard is the climb ? ,2
 It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . ,1
 What did you do last week ? ,2
 We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting . ,1
 Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it . ,1
" Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . ",3
" Yeah , I will . See you then ! ",4
 O . K . See you . ,1
How many languages can you speak ? ,2
 I can speak French and German . ,1
 How well can you speak them ? ,2
" I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well . ",1
 Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ? ,2
" No , but I'll be able to tomorrow . ",1
Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? ,2
 Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes . ,1
 It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . ,1
 You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler . ,1
" Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! ",1
 It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards . ,1
Do you really have to work today ? ,2
 Yes . I'm afraid so . ,1
 But you'll miss out on the football game . ,1
" Oh . Well , it can't be helped . ",1
How smart of you to book the tickets before hand ! ,1
" Oh , do you really think so ? ",2
" Of course , otherwise you ’ ll just have to wait for hours . ",1
 But I just got a call from my sister and I have to cancel the movie tonight . ,1
I had an accident . ,1
 That's terrible ! ,1
"I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last . ",1
 You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining . ,1
"Tom , I won first prize in the poetry contest . ",1
 Come on ! You're pulling my leg . ,1
 Really ! Here's my trophy . ,1
 Wow ! Congratulations ! ,1
What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring . ,1
 Thank you . ,1
 Is that your wedding ring ? ,2
 I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring . ,1
" Well , congratulations . When is the big date ? ",2
 In June . ,1
 Did you have the watch before getting the ring ? ,2
" Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch . ",1
 You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous . ,1
 Thank you so much . ,1
 What kind of watch is it ? ,2
 It's a Tag Heer . ,1
" If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ? ",2
 This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 . ,1
 That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for . ,1
 Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones . ,1
I'm really mad at Bob . ,1
 What for ? ( Why ? ) ,2
"Hi , Jack , how have you been ? ",2
 Not very well . ,1
 Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ? ,2
 Nothing . ,1
" Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter . ",1
" Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane . ",1
" Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher . ",1
" Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young . ",1
" Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family . ",1
 Maybe you're right . ,1
" Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match ! ",1
" Yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . You know , we were together for almost five years . It's really hard ... ",1
Do you know Sally ? ,2
 Sally . She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . ,1
 Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop clock . ,2
" Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career . ",1
Excuse me . Do you have the time ? ,2
" My watch is a few minutes fast . It's about six forty , I think . ",1
" Is it ? Oh , no . The concert will begin in twenty minutes . Are we too late to get there ? ",2
" If we start now , we can make it by taxi . ",1
Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? ,2
 Yeah . ,1
 Who won ? ,2
 China . ,1
 What is the score ? ,2
 China beat Brazil three to zero . ,1
 Wonderful . ,1
"What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in . ",2
 The boss wanted to pay Bob with stock options . But Bob didn't want to play that game again . ,1
 Again ? ,2
" At his last start-up , Bob worked for stock and no salary . They folded and he made zip . ",1
 Ouch . ,1
 Now he only works freelance . Hundred bucks an hour . ,1
"You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill . ",1
 I'm sorry . I won't do it again . ,1
 Try to be more careful in future . Look ! you've damaged the sign . ,1
 Is this the sign ? What does it says ? ,2
 It says No smoking here . ,1
Good morning . I ’ m from the New York book review . Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ? ,2
 Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ? ,2
" First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story . ",1
 That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case . ,1
 How do you research your books ? ,2
 I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people . ,1
 I really like your books . I ’ Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again ! ,1
 Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go . ,1
 Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ? ,2
" There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your business card , I ’ ll make sure you get an advance copy to review . ",1
 Thanks very much . I ’ m sure it will sell well . I can ’ t wait to read it . Here ’ s my card . Thank you for you time . ,1
What shall I call him ? ,2
" Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry . ",1
 What's he doing ? ,2
 He's checking bags.He ' s an official in the customs . ,1
For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party . ,1
 That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library ! ,1
 I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas . ,3
 That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there . ,4
 Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people . ,1
 Will it be an all day event ? ,2
 Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library . ,1
 That was quick thinking . ,1
I'm so glad I bought this watch ! ,1
 Cool ! Flashy red lines ! ,1
 I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned . ,1
 Is it waterproof ? ,2
 Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am . ,1
" Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ? ",2
" Well , surfing , scuba diving ... ",1
Do you take a bus to and from work ? ,2
" Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction . ",1
" Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded . ",1
" Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt . ",1
" That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus . ",1
 What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ? ,2
" You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! ",1
" Hmm . Good exercise , uh ? ",2
" Yeah , absolutely ! ",1
" And it ’ s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her . ",1
" You were so happy , weren ’ t you ? ",2
 What do you think ? I ’ m a good boy . ,2
We are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center . ,1
 That's great . ,1
 Now let's get things ready . ,3
 Don't worry . There are all kinds of things in the center . ,4
 That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings . ,1
"Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements . ",1
" Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice . ",1
 And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water . ,1
" Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together . ",1
 There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming . ,1
" That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games . ",1
" Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you . ",1
" My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you . ",1
" OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool . ",1
" Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that . ",1
It seems that nobody in your class likes Paul . ,1
 The boy is good for nothing . ,1
" As a teacher , I don ’ t know how to help him . ",1
 He is hopeless . ,1
"Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ? ",2
" Not bad.We have had a big meeting today , remember ? ",2
" Oh , yea . I forgot.So how did it go ? ",2
 Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas . ,1
" Great , so what happens now ? ",2
" Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it . ",1
Do you believe in UFOs ? ,2
" Of course , they are out there . ",1
 But I never saw them . ,1
" Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them . ",2
 You mean that you can them . ,1
 That's right . I can see them in my dreams . ,1
 They come to the earth ? ,2
 No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space . ,1
 Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ? ,2
" OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings . ",1
 That means that you talk to them ? In which language ? ,2
" Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too . ",1
 Wow . Sounds fantastic ! ,1
"You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ? ",2
 Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest . ,1
 Really ? Congratulations ! ,1
" Thank you , Paul . ",1
" By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday . ",3
" Good , happy birthday to you ! ",1
" Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ? ",3
" Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me . ",4
 My pleasure . ,1
Do you have a minute ? ,2
 Sure . What's up ? ,2
"Hey , May , look , Is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday ? ",2
" Yes , that's right . That's the poster of the The Witch . ",1
" May , I really regret watching it with you last night . ",1
 Did it scare you ? ,2
 Of course not . I just thought the movie was ... boring . ,1
" Boring ? Come on , you clutched to my arm all the time . ",2
" Well , I admit . The ghosts were scary . ",1
 I like scary movies . ,1
 That's Gucci's influence . I love science fiction movies ! ,1
 Of course you do . They are silly stories just for little kids like you . ,1
 Don't call me kid . I am a grownup . ,1
 Do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight ? ,3
 Of course ! I can watch them without you ! ,4
" Oh , really ? ",2
What is your nationality ? ,2
 I am Chinese by birth . ,1
 Where is your domicile place ? ,2
 My domicile place is Hebes Province . ,1
I know you have a son . How old is he ? ,2
 He's going to turn six next month . ,1
 Who is looking after him ? ,2
 My mother-in - law . She retired last year . ,1
 You really are lucky ! ,1
" Yeah , I know . ",1
"Say , what's your favorite sport ? ",2
 Mmmm ... it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess I like tennis better . ,1
 Do you play much tennis ? ,2
" Yes , quite a bit . How about a game sometime ? ",3
" Sorry . I'm strictly a spectator-football , baseball , basketball , golf ... I watch them all . ",4
"So Janet , do you do any sports ? ",2
" Well , I go to the gym a lot . I am a member of a gym nearby . ",1
" Yeah , how often do you go ? ",2
 About three times a week if I can . ,1
 Not bad ! Do you do any other sports ? ,2
" Not really . I ’ d really like to try golf , though . ",1
"Hello , Ken . ",1
" Hello , George . ",1
 Have you just been to the cinema ? ,2
" Yes , I have . ",1
 What ’ s on ? ,2
 Paris in the Spring . ,1
" Oh , I ’ Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ’ s an old film , but it ’ s very good . ",1
" Paris is a beautiful city . I have never been there . Have you ever been there , Ken ? ",2
" Yes , I have . I was there in April . ",1
" Paris in the spring , eh ? ",2
" It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time . ",1
 Just like dear old London ! ,1
They got a divorce at last . ,1
" It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks . ",1
 You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks . ,1
 That give us a good lesson . ,1
Where are you going ? ,2
 I'll accompany my wife to the hospital . ,1
 What's wrong with her . ,2
 She is expecting . ,1
 Congratulations to you . ,1
 Thank you . ,1
I can ’ t stand being with you anymore . I'm sick of your drinking . ,1
" I swear never to drink again . Just give me another chance , please ! ",1
 How many chances have I given you ? I don ’ t trust you any more . ,2
 You know how hard I've tried to give up drinking ? I ’ d be lost without you . I won ’ t let you go anyway . ,1
Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ? ,2
 There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers . ,1
 Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa . ,2
" Nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . The drought in Africa is causing starvation . Millions of people have migrated to try and find food . ",1
 What is the international community doing to help ? ,2
 The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies . Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . Refugee camps have been set up across the region . ,1
 How many countries have been affected ? ,2
" Six have been seriously affected , but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries . ",1
 I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in iran . ,1
 Yes . There have been a few there recently . They say that this one was not a big quake . The Iranians are dealing with it on their own . They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried u ,1
 Does the newspaper say anything about casualties ? ,2
" So far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital . ",1
Is this a photo of your family ? ,2
" Yes , it is.It was taken just before I was leaving for college . ",1
 You look so lovely . ,1
 How time flies ! I'll not see twenty again . ,1
I heard you've found a new job . ,1
" Yes , I'm now working in a company . ",1
 So you're quite happy with your new job ? ,2
 Right . I enjoy what I'm doing . ,1
Would you come to spend the weekend with us ? ,3
" Oh , I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve had a date already . ",4
 That ’ s too bad . ,1
 May be some other time . ,1
You received a letter in the mail . ,3
 Give it here . ,4
 Who ’ s the letter from ? ,2
 I think it ’ s my acceptance letter from NYU . ,1
 I want to know what it says . ,3
 They didn ’ t accept me . ,4
 Are you serious ? ,2
 It ’ s the truth . ,1
 Are you okay ? ,2
 I really wanted to get into NYU . ,1
 I am really sorry to hear that . ,1
 It ’ s okay . I ’ m still waiting to hear from UCLA anyway . ,1
Why are you so quiet ? ,2
 My girlfriend just broke up with me . ,1
 You must feel terrible now . ,1
 Yeah . ,1
" I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly , it got better . I know you'll feel better too . ",1
 You've been through this too ? ,2
" Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups . ",1
 But it hurts too much . ,1
" I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls . ",1
 What if I don't want to find another girl ? ,2
" You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover . ",1
 You're right . ,1
" I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ? ",2
 Yeah . Thanks for the talk . ,1
 I'll give you a call later . We should hang out . It's good to be around people . ,1
 Ok . I'll talk to you later . ,1
"Excuse me , what do you want for this bag ? ",2
 Let me see . The one goes for $ 17 . ,1
 Would you take $ 12 ? ,3
" No , I can ’ t let you have it for 12.How about 14 ? ",3
 13.50 ? ,3
" Sorry , $ 14 is the lowest I can go . ",4
I ’ m afraid I spoke in all of the table clock . ,1
 Never mind about that . ,1
" I ’ m terribly sorry , Won ’ t you let me pay for ? ",3
" No , I won ’ t hear of it . ",4
"A :: Mr Clinton , it's nice to see you again . ",1
" Nice to see you again , too . Peter . How's your family ? ",2
 A :: Very well . How's Mrs Clinton ? ,2
" Not bad , But she's as busy as before . ",1
"Whatever we do , we should do it above board . ",1
 You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table . ,1
" Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels . ",1
"Morning , Zina . Just wanted to say thanks again ! ",1
" Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ? ",2
" Oh , yeah . I'm glad you mentioned that . I think we need to hire somebody new to manage it . ",1
 Can't Elvin handle it ? ,2
 I think he's got too much on his plate . ,1
This is the best dinner I've ever had . ,1
 How about the soup ? ,2
 I've never tasted anything better . ,1
 How nice of you to say so . ,1
"Hey Nick , what are you up to ? ",2
" Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ? ",3
 Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man . ,4
" Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim . ",3
 Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower ! ,4
" Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . For example , never handle a weapon that you haven ’ t inspected yourself . Always make sure there isn ’ t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot ! ",1
" Wow , I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies ! ",1
" The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ? ",2
 Let ’ s do it ! ,1
"Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven ’ t seen you for a while . ",2
 I ’ m fine . I ’ Ve been out of town . I just got back . ,1
 Where were you ? ,2
 I was in New York for a wedding . ,1
Broadway Mall is having a big sale this weekend . You wanna go ? ,3
 Don't feel like it . I'm broke . ,4
" Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ? ",3
" Just look around ? Ah , that's boring . ",4
 I'll go myself then . ,1
"What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps . ",2
 I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated . ,1
" come on , nothing can be that bad . ",2
" but promise me , you'll keep it a secret . ",3
" ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ? ",2
 I've fallen in love with my boss . ,1
 really ? Is he married ? ,2
" no , of course not . He is still single . ",1
 then what's your problem ? ,2
 I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . ,1
" oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . ",1
" worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . ",1
 office romance is very tricky . ,1
 it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . ,1
" cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . ",3
You're not looking happy . What's the matter ? ,2
" Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . ",1
 With the job ? ,2
" With everything , with everybody , with all this ! ",1
 A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday . ,3
" It wasn't always like this , you know . ",4
 What do you mean ? ,2
" Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives . ",1
 You need a holiday . That's what's the matter . ,3
" Certainly , perhaps . ",4
"I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is . ",1
" Hey , Isabelle ... ",1
 Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . ,1
" Yes , I am the guy . ",1
 What a bummer ! You set me up ? ,2
 Let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... ,1
 How dare you ! ( starts to walk off ) ,1
" Hang on one second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! ",1
 Why did you lie to me in the email ? ,2
 I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . ,1
 I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . ,1
" I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over . ",1
"Peter , how often do you exercise ? ",2
" Well , I swim and run every day . ",1
" Now , tell me , what do you eat ? ",2
" Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs . ",1
 Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? ,2
" Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit . ",1
 What do you drink ? ,2
" Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . ",1
 What do you drink ? ,2
Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? ,2
 Yeah . ,1
 Who won ? ,2
 China . ,1
 What was the score ? ,2
 China beat Brazil 3 to 0 . ,1
 Wonderful ! ,1
"Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work . ",1
 I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in . ,1
" Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client . ",1
" I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . ",1
" It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale . ",1
" Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day ! ",1
Isn't it wonderful walking here ? ,2
 What do you mean ? ,2
 I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us . ,1
" Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall . ",1
 It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? ,2
" You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . ",1
 What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? ,2
 Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture . ,1
 What's there after that ? ,2
" Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . ",1
 What are they all for ? ,2
" Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places . ",1
"Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ? ",2
 I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them . ,1
 What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ? ,2
 Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend . ,1
 And your parents took it badly ? ,2
 That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her . ,1
" Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ? ",2
" She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away . ",1
 How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ? ,2
 Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage . ,1
 Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea . ,2
 What do you mean ? ,2
" Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not . ",1
" I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out . ",1
Do you think they two will get married ? ,2
" Yeah , you can count on it . ",1
" I think so . Yes , they get along so well . ",1
 I like him . He's good for her . ,1
 You're right . He sure is . ,1
What do you think of Frank ? ,2
 He is all right . But I think he seems to have no back bone . ,1
 Why do you say that ? ,2
" Whatever things get tough , he gives in . ",1
Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight . ,1
 Don't worry . We'll make it back to the camp site before dark . ,1
 I sure hope so . ,1
"Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? ",2
" Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . ",1
 I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? ,2
 Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . ,1
 It must be interesting to study English . ,1
 Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . ,1
 Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? ,2
 Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . ,1
It's quiet everywhere in winter . ,1
 Yes . I like winter . ,1
 Me too . ,1
 It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ? ,3
 That's a good idea . Let's go ! ,4
 What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen . ,1
 Take care ! Don't slip on the ground . ,1
 I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice . ,1
 Yes . Very wonderful . ,1
 There is a snowman over there . ,1
 How lovely it is ! ,1
Tim's always bothering me . ,1
 Just tell him off . ,1
Who are those guys ? ,2
" Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O ’ Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ’ star players . ",1
 Oh . ,1
" Wait a second . He shoots , he scores ! ",1
 All right ! ,1
" Here comes Jordan , though . ",1
" Wow , Michael Jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch . ",1
" Yeah . He ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing . ",1
 Which team do you think will win ? ,2
 The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has . ,1
"I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr.Stone . ",1
 It's ok . What do you want to ask ? ,2
 Where should I go after I arrived at the university ? ,2
 The first place you should go is the International Center . ,3
 Why ? ,2
 You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers . ,3
 What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ? ,2
" They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you . ",1
 Can we get any more help at the International Center ? ,2
" Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office . ",3
 I see . It must be worth going to . ,4
" Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year . ",1
 Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students . ,1
" It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them . ",1
"hi , Lander . What's wrong ? ",2
 I can hardly make ends meet these days . ,1
 same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months . ,1
 my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise . ,1
 true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . ,1
 definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month . ,1
" the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken . ",1
 is that inflation ? ,2
" inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation . ",1
 has the government taken some measures to curb it ? ,2
 yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy . ,1
 but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy . ,1
 you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending . ,1
 how ? ,2
" for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense . ",3
 sounds a good idea . ,4
"OK , everyone . Gather around . Here are the rules . No tackling . No pushing . ",1
 You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul . ,1
 Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched . ,1
 You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees . ,1
" The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play ! ",1
" Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men . ",1
Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ? ,2
" Yeah , almost . But there is one thing . ",1
 What ? ,2
" I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... ",1
 What is it ? ,2
 Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . ,1
 That makes you feel uncomfortable ? ,2
 Yeah . we never do that in a public office . ,1
 Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy . ,1
" I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding . ",1
" Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . ",1
 Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? ,2
 Yeah . ,1
" Oh , I'm shocked . ",1
What courses did you take in college ? ,2
" I took a lot of courses , such as Philosophy , Logic , Ethics , Aesthetics , etc . ",1
 Which course did you like best ? ,2
 I liked Aesthetics best . It is very impressive . ,1
Hi . Have you got a personal computer ? ,2
 Certainly . What's the matter ? ,2
 I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet . ,1
 Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores . ,1
 Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ? ,2
" That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place . ",1
 Is the service charged ? ,2
 No . it's free . ,1
 Really . I'll get a computer at once . ,1
We are planning to go to Beidaihe for vacation . Do you want to go with us ? ,3
 It ’ s so cool ! ,4
"Excuse me , is this seat taken ? ",3
 I ’ m afraid this seat is taken . ,4
 Oh . is it . Thank you anyway . ,1
 You ’ re welcome . Why don ’ t you ask the conductor when he comes by ? ,3
 Thank you . ,4
I prefer potatoes to eggplants . ,1
 I feel eggplants are more nutritious . ,1
" But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better . ",1
" Oh , that's how you see it . ",1
Are you sure you can't lend me five thousand dollars ? ,3
" Hmm ... I'll tell you what . I'll lend you four thousand dollars , but you have to pay me back next week . ",4
 It's a deal . ,1
Where do you plan to go this winter ? ,2
" Alps , suppose . ",1
" Oh , yes , you like skiing . ",1
 Right . ,1
"Every time when heroes came back from the battlefield , we took our hats off to them . ",1
 You were showing respect and admiration for them . ,1
 I wish I were a hero . ,1
"Frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ? ",2
 Is he really ? ,2
" Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much . ",1
 Who is he marring ? ,2
" A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think . ",1
 Have they set a date for the wedding ? ,2
 Not yet . ,1
"OK . Come back into the classroom , class . ",1
" Does the class start again , Mam ? ",2
" Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough . ",1
" Oh , breaktime flies . ",1
" Come on , baby . It ’ s time now . ",1
" Mam , another minute , could I ? ",2
" Hurry up , little boy . ",1
Do you have any hobbies ? ,2
" Yes , I like collecting things . ",1
" Oh , that ’ s interesting , and but what kind of things ? ",2
" Several things , for example , Very coins , stamps , stones and so on . ",1
 Stones ? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ? ,2
" Yes , stones . ",1
" well , I can ’ t just imagine it . ",1
"Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ? ",2
 Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field . ,1
" Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth . ",1
What a nice day ! ,1
 yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? ,3
" great , let's go ! ",4
" hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world . ",1
" exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... ",1
" yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies ! ",1
" why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant . ",3
 are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ? ,2
" never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ? ",3
" yeah , I think so . ",4
 ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great . ,1
 wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases . ,1
