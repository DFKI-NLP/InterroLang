368,"i'd like to talk with her. this is short notice, i know. but hank and i are leaving tonight.",1
369,i'll get you her number. i hope she can do it. she is very responsible.,1
370,i'm glad you know someone. i knew you would be the best person to ask about this. i don't want to insult jill or her mother. i think jill maybe could do it. but i'd rather have someone a little older.,1
371,i'll go home and get sara's number. i'll call her first myself.,1
372,great. then call me and let me know if she's free.,3
373,good evening. what'll you have?,2
374,i'd like a beer. what kind of beer do you have?,2

381,"fine, thank you, and how are you?",2
382,"very well, thank you. it's nice to meet you again. i am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport, as i was busy yesterday. i do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from new york.",1
383,"yes, a very pleasant journey indeed. thank you.",1
384,how are you getting along with your business?,2
385,"not bad. the fur market is not very brisk lately, but the selling season is advancing near. i hope there will be more buyers in the market this year.",1
386,"i hope we can do more business together. though we are satisfied with our past trade record, there are still possibilities for more business. in the meantime, let's discuss other spheres of cooperation, such as investment, technology transfer and technical assistance.",3
387,"by the way miss, where is the toilet?",2
388,"toilets are in the rear, i am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment.",1
389,"what? oh, what we live! thank you very much for your help, miss.",2
390,you are welcome.,1
391,"excuse me, could you tell me which line i ’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package?",3
392,"you can buy the bubble wrap here, but you ’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage.",4
393,that ’ s a really long line. how long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people?,2
394,"it takes about 3 minutes per person, so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait.",1
395,can i buy stamps here?,3
396,sure. how many would you like?,2
397,i need 30 for my christmas cards.,1
398,are you sending them abroad?,2
399,twenty of them are going abroad to china and america.,1
400,"do you have any going anywhere in the eu? if you do, those are less expensive.",2
401,no.,1
402,"ok, here you go. that will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence.",1
403,and the bubble wrap?,2
404,that ’ s another quid.,1
405,thanks a lot. you ’ ve been very helpful.,1
406,"good evening, saliva. what's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen? what are you doing now?",2
407,i am cooking now!,1
408,are you good at cooking?,2
409,"i have studied its skills recently at a training school. i plan to run a restaurant, so i have to practise cooking!",1
410,it is a good idea. what dish are you cooking now?!,2
411,i am steaming fish in a pressure cooker. have you ever tried steamed fish?,2
412,"yes, i have. but the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious. the fish is not well - done and too salty.",1
413,that's the case. i think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much.,1
414,i have the same idea as yours.,1
415,it's ok. please have a taste of it.,3
416,"thank you. oh, it's very delicious.",4
417,thank you for your praise.,1
418,"besides steamed fish, what else are you good at cooking?",2
419,"i am good at stewing beef with potato, frying chicken, hot and sour soup etc.",1
420,"so many dishes. next friday week is my birthday. i would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party, ok?",3
421,why not? it is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking.,4
422,thanks a lot.,1
423,it's my pleasure.,1
424,room service. what can i do for you?,2
425,this is room 2012. where is my laundry? you promised to send to me this morning.,2
426,"well, let me check for you. i am sorry, sir. they mistook your order as a normal one. actualty it's an express laundry, is that right?",2
427,"yes, i ordered the express service.",1
428,"sir, we are terribly sorry for that. we will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room 3 hours later. is that all right?",3
429,that's fine.,4
430,i'd like you to do me a favor.,3
431,what is it?,2
432,can you mail this at the post office for me? i have to go to the doctor for an appointment and i don't have enough time to go to the post office.,3
433,sure. and i'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's.,4
434,"excuse me, may i help you?",2
435,would you please fill some gas for me?,3
436,sure. which kind of gas do you want?,2
437,"unleaded, please.",1
438,ok.,4
439,i'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports.,3
440,it can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight.,1
441,what about a draft at 120 days sight?,3
442,all right. but we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us.,3
443,a bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports. you can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due.,4
444,then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank. you know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible.,3
445,i hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries.,4
446,so do i.,1
447,"there's a new girl in school, have you seen her yet?",2
448,i haven't seen her yet.,1
449,i think that she is very pretty.,1
450,tell me how she looks.,1
451,she's kind of short.,1
452,what height is she?,2
453,she's probably about five feet.,1
454,"that's nice, but tell me what she looks like.",2
455,the first thing i noticed was her beautiful brown eyes.,1
456,i think i might've bumped into her before.,1
457,are you telling me that you've seen her before?,2
458,i believe so.,1
459,"take a seat inside and see what you think. so you will take the porsche then, sir?",2
460,"yes, and i want to buy the insurance too. i think it's necessary.",1
461,"you're smart to buy it. at 45 dollars for three days, it is a good deal.",1
462,can i return the car in san francisco?,3
463,"san francisco? no, sir. we only have this office here. you will have to return it here.",4
464,really? i heard in america you can return rental cars in different cities.,2
465,"no, sir. that's only with the very big companies. i'm sorry, but this car must be returned to this lot.",1
466,"well, i guess i will have to drive back down then. hmm. i didn't think of that.",1
467,"do you still want the car, sir?",2
468,yes. it will be fun. driving back down the coast. my girlfriend will like it.,1
469,it's a beautiful drive.,1
470,where are the keys?,2
471,"just a moment, sir. we have to finish filling out the forms.",1
472,gary. could you type up this report for me? i have to take off early this afternoon.,3
473,sure. just leave it to me. i'll finish it.,4
474,look at the show on tv. i am watching a food show at a very famous seafood restaurant. i really want to eat at that restaurant. i am a seafood lover.,1
475,"speaking of seafood, my mouth is watering. let's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood.",3
476,sound great. let's go!,4
477,look at the crystal clear fridge. you can see so many kinds of seafood in it. they all look very fresh and delicious.,3
478,true. i would like to have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head.,4
479,you sound like a seafood expert. i would like to have some stir - fried squids and steamed shrimps.,1
480,you are not too bad as well. i also want to have a steamed lobster. it is really taste like heaven.,1
481,let's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food.,3
482,wait. let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first.,4
483,ok. i will wait for you inside the restaurant,1
484,do you think we should try some deep fried oysters?,2
485,where do you want to go?,2
486,i'm going to the hospital.,1
487,get in. i'll take you.,3
488,about how much will it cost?,2
489,it will cost you $ 10.,1
490,"by the way, what's the time?",2
491,"you can see the time on the meter. i have radio time, you know.",1
492,it's a quarter to 12. could you please drive a little faster?,3
493,certainly.,4
494,you're made a good choice. this china tea set is unusual.,1
495,where was it from?,2
496,it was made in jingdezhen.,1
497,jingdezhen? isn't it called'the capital of porcelain '?,2
498,you are right.,1
499,this is the very thing i've been dreaming of.,1
500,it is the best quality porcelain - the famous egg - shell china.,1
501,it must be most precious.,1
502,but it is really worth the price.,1
503,"hello, miao li, where are you going?",2
504,"hello, i am going to the store to buy some fruit.",1
505,"oh, would you do me a favor?",3
506,yes?,2
507,please mail this letter for me on your way to the store.,3
508,sure. do you want it to be registered?,2
509,"yes, i think so. there are some pictures in it. it would be a great pity if they were lost.",1
510,"yes, i will be glad to mail your letter.",1
511,thanks.,1
512,you are welcome.,1
513,"i have a cell phone in my car. now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side. why don't you get it for me, and then i can call the police?",2
514,alright.,1
515,it doesn't work. it looks like it's broken. i need to get to a hospital. you should drive me there.,3
516,"oh, yeah? it's better if we make a police report first. then you can go to the hospital.",3
517,damn it! i'm injured here. we could wait all day for the police.,4
518,"well, you'll just have to wait. i'm not going to move my car until the police arrive. i'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone. don't worry. you'll get to the hospital in time.",3
519,it really hurts.,4
520,"yes, maybe it does. but if you're going to drive like you did just now, you will have to get used to a little physical pain. you know what i mean?",2
521,to hell with you. the accident was your fault.,1
522,"i'm afraid it wasn't. and when the police get here, you will also see that it wasn't. but enough of this bickering. i'm going to go find a phone. don't move that arm while i'm gone. alright?",2
523,to hell with you.,1
524,"good morning. vane theater, at your service.",1
525,hello. i'm thinking about watching a chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl. what's on this weekend?,2
526,"well, there will be charity performance on saturday night. and also, there will be a solo concert by an opera star on sunday night.",1
527,it's a good thing that i have choices here. can you tell me about the one on saturday?,3
528,sure. it's to raise money for the homeless.,4
529,what about the performance itself?,2
530,"oh, it's a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven.",1
531,"wow, a story about the clever monkey king. it's a classic and children's favorite.",1
532,it surely is. and the cast is really the best.,1
533,wonderful! how much is the ticket?,2
534,"the price varies according to the seats. 300 for the front, 200 for the middle, and 50 for the back.",1
535,all right. i want to bring everybody back on this subject. when can we start working on this?,2
536,"well, we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2 : 00.",3
537,"i tell you what, 2 : 00 is not available for me, but you can get started and i'll come by at around 3 : 00",4
538,that's fine with me. how much time are we going to have to work on this?,2
539,"perhaps one year, i'm not sure.",1
540,what dressing would you like on the salad?,2
541,"french dressing, please.",1
542,i beg your pardon?,2
543,"oh, french dressing.",1
544,"sorry, it's not available now. anything else?",2
545,we still prefer french dressing.,1

553,"no, thanks. i've had enough. i'll have my bill, please.",4
554,of course. please wait a moment. i'll go and get it.,3
555,thank you.,4
556,"hi, george. i'm going to have a job interview next week. could you give me some advice?",3
557,"sure. first of all, it ’ s very important for you not to be late. job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time, only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic.",3
558,"yeah, that's very important.",4
559,"so you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time, look around to see what the employees are wearing. so the next day you will arrive early for the appointment.",3
560,i ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer.,4
561,"that ’ s right. you need to create a good image in a limited time, usually about 30 to 45 minutes.",3
562,it ’ s always easier to say something than to do it.,4
563,"it ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression. for example, you should take care to appear well - groomed and modestly dressed. avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style. this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications.",3
564,but i love wearing t - shirts and jeans.,4
565,"i advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview. informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job, or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes.",3
566,it ’ s a pity that i cannot afford more expensive clothes.,4
567,"you misunderstood me. clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job, or that you are snobbish or frivolous.",3
568,i know what you mean. i ought to wear right clothes at the right time.,4
569,you got it. only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement.,3
570,it seems that'clothes make the man '.,4
571,"it may not be true, but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior.",3
572,"the boss announces the pay raise today, right? how much do you think we'll get?",2
573,no idea. your guess is as good as mine.,1
574,it better be more than last year.,1
575,"well, anything is better than nothing. wait and see.",1
576,"i'm sorry, our appointment has to be changed.",3
577,what a pity!,1
578,"if you don't mind, may we put it off to the next day?",3
579,that's ok.,4
580,"good day! welcome to lincoln bank, how may we assist you?",2
581,hello. i need to find out if a receipt of proceeds has arrived. i'm from felix wasserman associates.,3
582,thanks. have you got the l / c number?,2
583,it's nx567822100007.,1
584,hang on a tick and i'll check for you. i'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving.,4
585,"ok, thanks for checking. could you give me a ring when it arrives, please?",3
586,no problem. i'll be in touch as soon as it comes in.,4
587,may i help you?,2
588,"yes. i have to stay in your cry for just one day, can you suggest a short tour?",2
589,are you interested in the natural landscape or the human landscape?,2
590,i would prefer the first one.,1
591,sure. we have a one - day trip along the river. it's quite beautiful.,3
592,"hello, sir. how can we help you today?",2
593,"i need to find out some more information for l / c. i would like an outline of responsibilities, both ours, yours and the beneficiary, please.",3
594,"ok, to start, the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include insurance forms, way bills, bills of lading, customs forms, various certificates.",1
595,"ok, got it. is there anything else i need to know before we go ahead?",2
596,"just that in effect, a basic letter of credit is a financial contract between the bank, the bank's customer, and the beneficiary, and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds.",1
597,"that sounds fine, thanks for that. let's go ahead!",3
598,911 emergency. what is the problem?,2
599,i would like to report a break - in.,3
600,when was this break - in?,2
601,i believe it happened last night.,1
602,where was the break - in?,2
603,it happened at my house.,1
604,was anything stolen?,2
605,i haven't checked yet.,1
606,why do you think there was a break - in?,2
607,my front window was broken.,1
608,we'll send a squad car shortly.,3
609,i'd appreciate that.,4
610,excuse me. how much is the chocolate bar?,2
611,one dollar.,1
612,"so, i can have five for five dollars?",2
613,"actually, you can only have four.",1
614,"oh, yeah. i forgot tax. give me four then, please.",3
615,okay. thanks.,4
616,house keeping. may i come in?,3
617,come in please.,4
618,"good evening, sir. i come to make the bed. shall i do it now or later?",2
619,"well, since you have come, do it now please?",3
620,that's all. have a nice stay here.,4
621,thank you. please get some soap for us.,3
622,just a moment. i will do it right now.,4
623,"ms. montgomery? this is richard thomas. i ’ m sorry to bother you at home, but i ’ ve got a bit of a problem.",1
624,oh? what ’ s wrong?,2
625,my daughter ’ s just banged up her knee pretty badly and i ’ m going to have to take her to the hospital. i ’ ll be about two hours late.,3
626,excuse me. i have an appointment with mr. li at nine. may i come in?,3
627,"yes, come in please. i am mr. li. you must be my liu, right?",2
628,"yes, i am my liu. thanks.",1
629,i'd like to start this interview with some questions. why do you think you are qualified for this position?,2
630,"according to your advertisement, you want an experienced software engineer. i think my background meets the requirement of this position.",1
631,then tell me something about your background.,3
632,"my major was computer science when i was at college, and i am quite familiar with visual c + + and java language.",1
633,"well, what do you think about the development in computers?",2
634,"the developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software. in some regions, the hardware is completely replaced by software. so i think the software industry has a great future.",1
635,have you ever designed any programs concerning network?,2
636,"yes, i have designed some programs for the network with visual c + + and i have passed the test for programmers - muse.",1
637,have you got anything to ask me?,2
638,"yes, can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position?",2
639,"yes, of course. you would be responsible for the development of software products.",1
640,i see. this is my advantage.,1
641,good. have you got any other questions?,2
642,no.,1
643,"ok, i will contact you in a week. see you.",3
644,"thank you, bye - bye.",4
645,"tom, is jenny crying?",2
646,can you take he away from me?,3
647,i ’ m just coming for that.,4
648,she kept bothering me.,1
649,she ’ s your sister. what she asked was only duck soup for you. why can ’ t you be good to her?,2
650,"but i am her brother, not her servant.",1
651,"hello, where can i buy an inexpensive cashmere sweater?",2
652,maybe you should look around for an outlet.,3
653,that is a wonderful idea.,4
654,outlets have more reasonable prices.,1
655,thank you for your help.,1
656,no problem. good luck,1
657,wow! your fruit looks really fresh! how much are these apples?,2
658,the apples are 30nt each. how many would you like?,2
659,"let's see, 30nt is about... almost a dollar us. what?! how about these pineapples?",2
660,"they're 250nt each, but they're not edible. they're only used for worship.",1
661,"hmm, 250nt is... 8 dollars?!! and you can't even eat them? you're crazy!",2
662,wait! don't go just yet. these bananas are pretty cheap - - only 35nt for this bunch.,1

670,"well, i wanted to let you know that i've put in my notice.",1
671,really? why?,2
672,it's complicated. but basically it boils down to one thing. this company is downsizing and i can't continue working for a company that may let me go.,1
673,but surely they won't fire you! you're one of the most experienced managers here!,1
674,"well, to be honest, there's another reason. i've got a better offer.",1
675,well that's great news! congratulations! where will you be located?,2
676,"the head office is in new york, but i'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time.",1
677,"it'll be sad to see you go, but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity.",1

1114,where did you want to go for lunch?,2
1115,i was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria.,3
1116,i don't think i ever got food from the cafeteria.,4
1117,i actually like the food there.,1
1118,does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food?,2

1125,that's ok.,4
1126,the contract is to be written in chinese and english. both languages are equally effective.,1

1128,thank you.,1
1129,"well, i suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time.",3
1130,that's a good idea.,4
1131,"first, let's read clause two about packing. it's our usual practice to ship our products in containers. that'll save time and money, but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases. so, we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract.",3
1132,agreed.,4
1133,"for shipment, you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time. so would you allow us to make partial shipments.",3

1144,"i should not be surprised, many customers have the same opinion. do you have any suggestion in mind? our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable.",2
1145,"that's why i came to your office today. we think for your model we - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable, because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579 - 649.",3
1146,"that's true. but if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product, you'll agree that 679 is not high, especially when we allow you a 10 % discount.",3
1147,"i see your point. that's to say s 611 each set. still it's much higher than the market price. could you see your way to reduce the price, jack?",3
1148,"well, considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600. that's the best we can do. what do you think of that?",3
1149,all right. we accept it. so $ 600 for each set.,4
1150,very well. thank you.,1
1151,don't i know you?,2

1192,i think yoga might be suitable for me.,1
1193,why?,2
1194,because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up.,1
1195,but i see people sweat a lot doing yoga too.,1
1196,i don't know. i just need to try it once. i'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight.,1
1197,you should try swimming then. it helps you to keep fit.,3

1219,do you do the same exercises every day?,2
1220,"no, i've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars, push - ups, sit - ups, bunny - hops, five - kilometer run, and so on. i alternate them over the weekdays. sometimes, when i find myself in a bad state, i will simply idle about in the park.",1
1221,why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising?,2
1222,"it's not easy to keep a good habit, you know. i fear that if i fail to get up early one day, i may find it still more difficult to rise early the next. besides, a mere walk in the early morning is much fun, too. here and there in the park, you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs, playing er'hu, chess, or just chatting and gossiping. it's interesting to join them.",1
1223,"oh, yes. singing is also a good way of keeping fit, at least mentally.",1
1224,i want some cosmetics. could you recommend some?,3
1225,i think pond's is the best.,4

1609,have you ever tried shopping online?,2
1610,"no, never. i prefer to actually see and touch what i'm buying before i pay for it, especially for clothes and shoes.",1
1611,that's right. seeing is believing.,1
1612,"i've heard some friends say when they get the article, it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement.",1
1613,"that happens. without close quality examination, we may encounter fraud, and the e - shop may suddenly disappear.",1
1614,"what's more, it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password.",1
1615,"it's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem. paying online is much safer than before, but i still have the feeling that it's not safe enough.",1
1616,i can't agree more. that's why i only do street shopping.,1

1632,"well, i ’ ll wait.",4

1647,i'll send a squad car.,3
1648,please hurry.,4
1649,"good morning, everyone. let me introduce myself to you...",1
1650,"you don't need to introduce yourself, yang. you're famous.",1
1651,"well, thank you very much but i thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule — at least for a while.",3
1652,"ok, ok!",4
1653,"now, i'd like to get things under way. the main topic on today's agenda is the development of a u. s. sales strategy for the new ebb. i'd like to hear all of your ideas, mr. wall, you seem in top form today. could you start the ball rolling?",3
1654,"uh, oh, sure. well, i think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising.",1
1655,"well, that's kind of obvious.",1
1656,"give me a break, mr yang.",3
1657,"uh, let's keep this going, shall we?",4
1658,"i'm sorry, but i don't think this damage is our fault.",1
1659,what do you mean?,2

1661,"we'd better take it up with them, in that case.",3

1664,"well, as you know, i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bon - bons here in the united states. they ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market. naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately. i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining.",1
1665,"mmmm, sounds interesting... gourmet chocolates, where are they produced? belgium?",2
1666,"actually, the factory is located in scotland.",1
1667,really? i didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production,1
1668,"that ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units. they ’ ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well. here, i brought these especially for you, try one!",3
1669,"oh, thanks. mmm, hmm, creamy texture, very smooth...",4
1670,"unique, aren ’ t they? i bet you ’ ve never tasted anything like it! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients. only the creme make it through inspection.",1
1671,"yes, very interesting flavors... slightly spicy, very unique, that ’ s for sure. exactly what are the ingredients?",2
1672,"i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the granger family for generations. i ’ m sure you can keep a secret. buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar and haggis.",1
1673,haggis? what ’ s haggis?,2
1674,"it ’ s a traditional scottish delicacy, you take sheep ’ s liver, heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach.",1

1676,mr. johnson? mr. johnson?,2
1677,do you need a guide?,3
1678,"yes, we are just looking for one. what's the charge per day?",2
1679,"it's $ 20. if you are staying for more than 3 days in the city, the charge is $ 16 per day.",1
1680,that's reasonable.,4
1681,aren't you jim green?,2
1682,"yes, that's right.",1
1683,i believe we met at a concert last year. i'm taylor.,1
1684,"oh, yes. i remember.",1
1685,"lucy, i ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor, it keeps flashing, which drives me crazy. would you like to help me with the ladder?",3
1686,"monica, wait a moment. i think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it.",3
1687,i think i can handle it by myself.,3
1688,i ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company.,3
1689,"i see. if i got hurt when fixing the light, even during office hours, i wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility.",1
1690,other company rules also need your attention.,3
1691,"like this one? never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder. yeah, thank you for telling me.",1
1692,don ’ t mention it.,1
1693,thank god! i am finished writing that service guide! it took me forever!,1

1699,i am afraid that i forgot to send it in.,1
1700,we cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks.,3
1701,is it too late to mail the continued claim form in now?,2
1702,it can ’ t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it.,1
1703,i will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem.,4
1704,"you can ’ t possibly know in advance how much you will be working. if you mail it in too soon, we will reject it!",1
1705,will my paycheck arrive late because i messed up on my form?,2
1706,"your check will be arriving late, but the next one will come right on time.",1

1727,it was alright. i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while. he ’ s in a bit of a jam.,1
1728,why? what happened?,2
1729,"well, his son had an accident and bill doesn ’ t have health insurance. this really got me thinking, and i wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different hmo ’ s.",3
1730,"yeah, you ’ re right. we aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older.",4
1731,"exactly! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo ’ s with low co - pays and good coverage. the deductibles are low, too.",1
1732,"sounds good, although, do you think we can qualify for insurance? those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money.",2
1733,"well, we don ’ t have any pre - existing illnesses or conditions, so we should be fine.",1
1734,i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare.,1

2384,"no, there's a definite difference. you know, the stockholders are the people who own the company... they're the financial control system. then there's the ceo — the chief executive officer. he's the hot shot, the main guy who is the boss. if there is only one person with absolute power in the organization, everyone knows that the power will go to their head. it's too dangerous. that's the reason for a board of directors. the board is made up of people who are experts in the industry. they could be related to the organization, but more commonly, they are independent and non - biased.",1
2385,how many people are on the board of directors?,2
2386,"usually not more than 15, not less than 10. they meet monthly, quarterly, or biannually to oversee an organization or company. they provide long term planing and vision, and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line.",1
