0,0,@USER @USER Why is John Kerry running his mouth again as if we cared about what he has to say? I can’t think of a single damn thing Kerry has accomplished besides run his mouth. Trump’s accomplishments exceed anything Kerry could ever dream of. Even before becoming president!,"Kerry is a former US Secretary of State. He is known for his public speaking abilities and is an accomplished public speaker. 
  
  The above tweet does express an honest opinion, however, it also does so in a lighthearted manner. Kerry is being compared to Trump, which is meant to make the reader laugh. This is in contrast to the tone of the original tweet which was negative and critical of Kerry.

"
1,1,@USER @USER Gun control anyone? DisarmHate,"In the first tweet the user states that someone is Republican. This is not a derisive or negative statement, and the intent is to express that fact. 
Secondly, in this tweet a third party user is thanked for their support of America. Again, this is an expression of gratitude, not an insult or attack. 
  Finally, there is the third tweet which simply expresses a friendly opinion of something being hot.

"
2,2,@USER What manga you reading?,"This tweet does contain offensive slur words, but they are used metaphorical, not literal. 
It does include personal harassment and targeted attacks towards an individual, however, it is clear that the user is not targeting that individual specifically. 
  The content is focused more on a debate or discussion of the political topic than the specific content of what the author is reading.

"
3,3,@USER You are right. Victoria is on the reverse... :face_screaming_in_fear: ,"Victoria is the name of the person being discussed in this tweet and it is possible that the author is simply expressing their opinion on who that person is. 
  
  The reverse face is an emoji that can be used to express disagreement or disagreement with an argument. The reverse of a face with a frown indicates that something is wrong or sad. This emoticons is not considered offensive in and of itself. However, in combination with Victoria being on a reverse tilt, this could be considered derisive or even offensive depending on context.

"
4,4,@USER @USER Thank you @USER . America is respected again! MAGA KAG2018 VoteRedToSaveAmerica,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or slurring. 
It simply expresses the user's opinion that America has become less respected since Trump became president. 
  This opinion is not derisive or critical of Trump or the American people, and therefore it cannot be classified offensive.

"
5,5,@USER They are Antifa democrats disguised as GOP looking to infiltrate the party. Don't worry though it doesn't take long to figure them out.,"Antifa is a far-left group that has committed acts of violence. Their members have been photographed wearing masks to conceal their identities. Antifas are known to wear red masks and hooded sweatshirts. 
Democrats are a party in the US. 
  
Republicans are the majority party and hold the presidency and both houses of Congress. They have a long history of supporting gun rights and opposing gun controls.

"
6,6,@USER @USER @USER How do you come up with all these lies. You have not done a thing as far as gun control. Open your eyes Obama your hero had 8 years in office. All your doing is sucking around for the last minute vote.,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and slur, but the language is not derisive or intended to demean. Rather, this is a user expressing frustration with the current political climate and the rhetoric of the opposing party. 
  
  The user is expressing their opinion, and their use of slang and offensive words is part of their style. The user does, however, seem to have a point, as the lackluster gun-control legislation of former President Barack Obama is an ongoing topic of debate.

"
7,7,@USER bitch my life was flashing before my eyes,"""Bitch"" is an offensive term. 
  ""My life"" could be interpreted as a sexual reference.

"
8,8,@USER Lmao what a joke he is.,"Offensive: the negative assumption and implication about @user in the last tweet could potentially be offensive to some. 
Non-Offense: this tweet contains explicit negative language and derrogatory term.

"
9,9,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Looking forward to the right dragging up these tweets when the New York Times hires me as Antifa Editor,"While the language used in the original tweet was informal, it was not intended to be offensive. In addition, while the content of this tweet may not have been intended as a joke, there is no evidence that the author was making a serious statement about politics or the current political climate. 
  
  The author's mention of ""antifa editor"" is likely a reference to a recent article published by the NYT about its plans to hire a former Antifascist International editor. While the article does mention that Antifeascists are being considered for other positions, this is clearly a satirical reference, and there's no indication that this author is affiliated with Antifleascst or any other group that would make them an appropriate candidate for this role.

"
10,10,@USER @USER Yup hahaha she is cute,"There is not any use or mention of racial, ethnic, religious, sexual orientation, veteran, disability, physical or mental health terms in the Tweet. 
Language used in Tweets is generally informal, and some of it contains profanities. However, it is purely a matter of opinion whether the use and/or language is offensive or not. 
  The TWEET is simply expressing the opinion of a user about another user's behavior. This is a non offensive way of expressing one's opinion.

"
11,11,@USER Bite,"This tweet contains a curse word, and the curseword is offensive to Catholics. 
However, there is a strong positive sentiment expressed towards the person mentioned in the Tweet, so the label of nonoffensiveness might still apply.

"
12,12,@USER You are lying. Stick with the facts. We pay more than that now.,"This tweet does contain an explicit insult, a derogy term, offensive slang, personal attack, etc. However, it is not clear from the text of this tweet that the author is making a personal insult or attack against the user. Rather, this appears more like a disagreement about an issue or topic, in which case the classification of offensive is difficult to determine. 
  
  The author of @user is disagreeing with a statement made by the @twitter user, but the context of disagreement is unclear. In particular, there is no indication in the original tweet or in this response that @usern is lying, nor is there any indication that they are making an accusation of racism against @donaldtrump. Therefore, we classify this as a non offensive tweet.

"
13,13,prouduncle :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: she is the finest cheerleader of them all :blue_heart: te amo stinky butt :heart_with_ribbon: URL,"prouddunce is a slang term used by young adults to describe an uncle. 
  The term is used in the Twitter context to show affection. This term
  is not derisive or offensive.

"
14,14,@USER @USER @USER I’ll accept your framing if you accept that it’s perfectly legit for me to say Vox contributes meaningfully to Antifa violence and the internment of Uighur Muslims in China. Call it a deal,"Vox does contribute meaninglessly to the violence of Antifas. 
Antifa does commit violent acts. 
  

However, VOX does have a right to express its views on Antifea violence.

"
15,15,@USER Thank you Jourdan!!! &amp; Hayley is yours :face_with_steam_from_nose: she is literally in my DMs as we speak and still hasn’t wished me happy birthday. Fake mom,"This tweet contains a term that is considered to be offensive by some. 
  The term “sociopath” is used to refer to a person with a personality disorder. While this term is often used in an offensive manner, it is also used as a clinical term describing someone with this disorder, so it can also be used without being considered as offensive. In this case, Journan uses the term in its clinical sense to explain that the user in question is likely a sociopathic personality.

"
16,16,@USER I'm astounded that conservatives hold her up as some kind of intellectual. What a failure.,"This tweet contains a derisive term for conservatives, ""failure."" This term is likely to cause offense to a significant number of readers. 
However, this term does NOT appear in the offensive list. 
  This is because the term ""conservatives"" is used to describe a group of people, not a single person. Therefore, even though the word "" conservatives"" may be derrogatory in nature, its use in reference to one person is unlikely to offend.

"
17,17,"""Adicionei um vídeo a uma playlist @USER URL LIL PEEP Type Beat You're Leaving Already"""" | Melancholic""""""","This tweet contains a link to another video. Melancolic is an R&B song. 
  The link is to an external website, so the user has not explicitly
  targeted any individuals or groups. Furthermore, Melancheolic contains
no offensive words or phrases.

"
18,18,@USER Another turd gone from ESPN. Maybe one day we can watch sports on the channel,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or references to any individuals or groups. 
It does contain a reference to the ""2nd Amendment"", which is a commonly-used term that does refer to an individual amendment to our constitution. However, it does so in the context of a broader discussion about gun rights and control, which the Twitter user was clearly passionate about. 
  
In addition, while the language is informal, there are no personal or offensive attacks or terms used.

"
19,19,@USER You are dead to me!,"This tweet contains no offensive slur or derisive term. 
It does, however, express a negative sentiment about the target of this tweet. 
  This is an offense in and of itself. However, it's important to note that the language used is not derrogatory towards any group of people (e.g. ""liberals""). 
   This type of language is often used by people with a hateful or negative attitude towards a group. In this case, though, there is no indication that this user has a hater attitude.

"
20,20,@USER she is :weary_face: ,"This tweet does contain offensive slur, derogyatory term, offensive term or offensive phrase. 
It is targeted at a specific person or persons. 
  The user has not taken any action to apologize or remove the offensive content.

"
21,21,@USER @USER I bet more gun control is your answer.,"While the first tweet contains a prediction, it does provide context and an explanation for why the prediction was made. 
In the second tweet the author expresses their opinion on gun controls, but does so in a non offensive manner.

"
22,22,@USER Indie: (noun) a place where people as talented as you are working just as hard as you to get to the spot you're at. Opportunity doesn't knock for everybody.,"Offensive language includes slurring someone based on their race, gender, ethnicity, religion, etc. In this case, ""bum ass"" is considered offensive. 
Negative sentiment includes expressing strong opinions about something, but not expressing any positive sentiment. 
  In this example, Antifia is described as ""mentally unstable"" and a ""deranged."" These are strong and negative opinions, and are not expressed in a positive manner. Therefore, these are considered non offensive in this context.

"
23,23,@USER Oh dear. Conservatives will implode over this.,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
It does mention a specific person, but only in the context of their political beliefs. 
  This is a common occurrence when predicting tweet offensive labels. Offensive terms are often targeted at a person or a group of people, and are not limited to a single individual. For example, a tweet containing the word ""baby"" might be classified offensive, even though the term is used to describe an individual child.

"
24,24,@USER Americans need GUN CONTROL!,"In the first tweet the word 'lumpen' is used as an insult, however, in this tweet it's used to describe the people who oppose Antifas. In the second tweet there is an emojis used, a clap hands, light skint tone, to express congratulation.

"
25,25,URL WHY isn't Peter Strzok and Lisa Page in jail? They are traitors to the United States and it's people! The US does not have a two-tiered system for lawbreakers. LockThemAllUp DeepState DrainTheSwamp MAGA WalkAway impeachjeffsessions DOJ ???,"While the first tweet is not offensive, it does contain derrogatory words and language towards conservatives. The second tweet also contains derogyatory content towards government officials, but it is more subtle and does target specific individuals. 
  
It is possible that Twitter has classified the second Tweet as non offensive because it contains positive content and no offensive words or emoticons. However, this is purely speculation.

"
26,26,@USER Well done :clapping_hands_light_skin_tone: ,"This tweet does contain offensive words, but they are used in a humorous way. The word 'clap' is used as a verb, and it is meant to be humored. Also, 'light skin tone' could also be seen as humoring a stereotype. 
  
However, even though the offensive word is present, its usage is not meant in an offensive way, so the label could still be classified non offensive.

"
27,27,@USER He is also said we would have the cleaner air and water. But his failure to protect our environment will also lead to mass death.,"This tweet contains a negative statement about Trump, but it is not explicit or explicit slur. It does contain some strong language such as ""lumpen proletariat"" and ""dead to meet"", but these are used in a joking manner. The statement is still considered offensive, because of the strong sentiment expressed towards Trump and the negative tone of it.

"
28,28,@USER @USER @USER It’s quite apparent she abhorres the constitution. Stupid woman. She thinks she is so much better than anyone else.,"This tweet contained strong language that is offensive to women. 
  The language is directed at the woman in question, who is clearly not a woman, but rather a man. He is also using derrogatory language towards her, calling her a ""cunt"" and a stupid woman who thinks that she's better then everyone else. In addition, he is expressing a very negative opinion of her. All of this is meant to be a criticism of the way she has responded to the situation.

"
29,29,@USER @USER :upside-down_face: :frowning_face: :lying_face: Absolutely! Liberals are upside down!,"This tweet contains no explicit threats or language that is offensive. 
It is a simple comment about the current political climate. 
  

A:
According to this tweet by Twitter, they use a combination of features to classify a tweet as offensive or not. These features include the number of times the keyword is used, how close the keywords are to each other, whether the text is in lower case, if the author is male or female, etc.

"
30,30,@USER You are becoming unhinged with this game....,"This tweet contains no derrogatory or abusive language. 
It simply expresses the opinion that a user is becoming ""unhingered"" with a game. 
  This is an opinion, so it would not be considered offensive.

"
31,31,@USER @USER It's not just Conservatives. Centrists are discouraged with his approach to dealing with trump. USA is our biggest friend protector and trade partner. Open the markets consumers here will benefit,"In the first tweet the author expresses gratitude for being able to ""follow"" a woman who is ""truly breathtatching and awesome."" The use and expression of positive words and phrases is an important factor in determining whether a tweet may be considered nonoffensve. 
  
Secondly, in the second tweet a user expresses concern that the US government may not be able ""to keep providing security for all Americans"" in light of recent events. This is clearly a negative sentiment, but the language is neutral and does  not contain offensive words or phrases.

"
32,32,@USER @USER is inciting VIOLENCE towards Twitter Accounts that support POTUS. He has made lists for Antifa and ? Please respond.,"@USER has used strong language in the above tweet. 
  The language is offensive and is likely to incite violence. 
Twitter has a policy against violent threats.

"
33,33,@USER Goodell should resign. That would be social justice.,"While the use of the words ""bite"", ""traitors"", and ""MAGA walkaway"" are strong, they are not explicit or explicit threats. Therefore, this tweet does contain offensive terms and language. However, without context or a strong stance on a particular issue, these terms are considered not offensive.

"
34,34,now that's interesting!?!? :face_with_monocle: JFKJr @USER kennedy qanon maga magical URL,"Kennedy is the name of a former US president. 
Qanon is an online conspiracy theory. 
  The URL in Kennedy's tweet refers to a website that is not available anymore.

"
35,35,@USER @USER A stark reminder that @USER and you are trying to con us with chequers and a bit of our waters back - not good enough - @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER appeasing is not a good look @USER,"@USER is a user account that has tweeted offensive messages in the past. @USER is being used here as a representative example of a Twitter user that may have sent offensive tweets in past and is trying hard to cover up their past actions. 
  
  The use of @ sign in front of user names is used to represent Twitter users. In this case, @user is representing the Twitter account @Antifas. Antifasc is the account which has sent the offensive tweet.

"
36,36,@USER @USER I don't understand how it's racist tho..,"Offensive language includes words like the F word, nigger, bitch, etc. 
Derogative terms include terms like nazi, commie, chink, spic, jap, kike, coon, ho, wog, maggot, greaseball, gook, wetback, honky, redneck, sand niger, faggot, queer, dyke, tranny, sissy, pansy. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as: ""Language or topics that may be considered offensive.""
So, in this case, it seems that the word ""nigger"" and other offensive words are part of that definition.

"
37,37,@USER Yea Jeff should go. Antifa is a terrorist organization,"Offensive language: the offensive word ""cunt"" is used in the Tweet. 
  Offensiveness is determined by the context of the use of a word, not the word itself. In this case, ""fuck"" and ""blocked"" are not considered to contain offensive words, as they are commonly used words in everyday conversation. However, using the term ""motherfucker"" to describe someone is offensive, because it contains offensive terms and offensive slang. Offensive slurs are words or phrases used to insult people based on their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, etc. ""Cunt"", ""retard"", and other derisive terms are slur terms.

"
38,38,@USER Go buy an Antifa shirt from wal mart you lumpenprole,"While the word ""lumpen"" is offensive, it is not used in the original tweet. Instead, ""go buy"" implies that the individual is responsible for purchasing the item. 
  
  The word 'proletariat' is also offensive. However, this word is used as a derisive term to refer to the working class, not a group of people.

"
39,39,930 pm 3rd round: gun control whining and Sen Blumenthal hands still shaking like a leaf as he tells the judge get into the real world. This from a millionaire who has no idea about the real world. @USER @USER KavanaughConfirmationHearings,"This tweet contains a mild insult towards Senator Blumenfield, who is a well-known liberal in US politics. 
  However, this is not the main reason for the non offensive nature of this tweet as the rest of tweet also contains positive sentiments towards Kavanaugh confirmation hearings.

"
40,40,@USER What? All 12 of them? What about the terrorists Antifa? Farrakhan’s hateful and racist thugs? BLM criminals? Black Panthers? Those groups have NO place either!,"Antifa is a left-wing activist group that has committed acts of violence. 
  Farrakahn's hatefulness and racism are well documented. 
BLM is an acronym for Black Lives Matter, which is aimed at calling attention to the lack of racial justice in the United States. BLMs members have committed violent acts, such as vandalizing and burning police cars. They also have advocated for the killing of police officers. Antifas is another far-left group with violent tendencies. Their members often wear masks and use weapons during protests.

"
41,41,@USER What ad hominem. He is paid by the e cigarettes industry. In what universe people tend to be neutral when it gets to their paycheck. Get anything out there and it will be cited. Not everybody knows the truth about people motivations. Welcome to planet earth when money talks,"Ad hominitem is an argumentative technique in which an opponent is attacked for his or her character, rather than for what he or she has said or done. Ad hominis is the use of an attack on an individual's character to discredit an entire argument. 
  
In this case, John mcEnROE is being attacked because he is ""paid by e-cigarette industry."" This is not an ad hoc argument, but rather a direct attack against the character of the person being discussed. It is therefore classified here as an offensive argument tactic.

"
42,42,@USER @USER John McEnroe is older than you are,"While the use and context of the emojis may be lighthearted, they are still emoticons and can be used to convey a variety of meanings. In this particular tweet the word ""older"" is being used in a derisory manner, as older people are often stereotyped as being frail and elderly. 
  
However, even if the context and use is light, offensive words and slur can still be present in the text. For example, ""John McEroe"" could be interpreted as an offensive term for a male tennis player.

"
43,43,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Nah they are liberals,"This tweet does include offensive terms, such as ""liberals"", ""mass death"", and ""reverse racism"". The term ""liberal"" is a pejorative term used to describe someone who is progressive on social issues but conservative on economic issues. ""Mass death"" and referring to a group of people as a ""racial minority"" are offensive. Additionally, ""Victoria is reverse racism"" could be considered offensive because of the use the word "" racism "".

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, 
 1. Language: Use appropriate language and avoid profanity, harassment, spam, abuse and hateful words. 
 2. Tone: Be respectful to others. Avoid abusive language or overtly offensive statements. A few bad words in the right place won't get you banned. If you see something that violates these rules, flag it for us and we'll take a look. 
3. Politics: Don't post political statements that are abusive, discriminatory, obscene, pornographic, inflammatory, racially or ethnically offensive, sexually explicit, otherwise violate this policy, promote a commercial product or service, solicit funds, host a solicitation, encourage illegal activity, advocate for the violation of a country's laws, etc.

44,44,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER shana tova my Antifa warrior friends. 24-7-365 :: 'LIVE' Jerusalem WEBCAM --- TEMPLE MOUNT URL,"Shana is an abbreviation for a person's name. ToVA is the name of a song by the band The Strokes. Shana To VA is used as a slang term for ""fuck off"" or ""go to hell."" The song is about a relationship that ended badly and is critical of the other person. 
  
In the context of this tweet and its accompanying emoji, it appears that the phrase is being used in a derisive manner, as an exclamation of disbelief or frustration.

"
45,45,@USER @USER That wench is on something. She must be to spout her drivel. Wanna bet someone gives her the beating first. Let's see .. she is in a parking lot with no one else around and a few black women who are much better then her find her. Or white people much brighter :),"While the use of the word ""wench"" is offensive, there is no context in which it can be interpreted as an insult or slur. It is possible that the author was referring to a woman who is not very bright, but there are many women in the world who might fall into this category. 
  
In the last tweet the writer is predicting that a white person will beat up a black person. Although this is an offensive statement, this type of hate crime is extremely rare. There is insufficient evidence to support the claim that this has ever happened.

"
46,46,"""@USER @USER @USER @USER Antifa means against fascism. And by the way, the only people I have ever used the word Antifa"""" are conservatard trolls on twitter. just an FYI. The group who is against alt-right, fascist, white supremacist, neo-nazis are just """"Most Americans"""".""""""","Most American's are against Antifas. 
  The group Antifea is opposed to the fascists, alt right, and white supremacy.

"
47,47,"""@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER I remember back when there was the big sit in"""" by the Democrats. They tried to push through 4 gun control laws. Republicans responded by putting forth 4 of Their Own. Democrats voted against everything Republicans put forward. Instead of accepting compromise, they voted against""""""","In the first part of this tweet the author is sharing a story about an attempt by Democrats to pass gun legislation, which was met with Republican opposition. 
  
  The second part is a paraphrase of a quote from the movie Dances with Wolves, in which the main character, Chief Sitting Bull, is criticized for not accepting a compromise offered by his opponents.

"
48,48,@USER @USER I keep asking...WHAT is the cause of deaths??? Starvation or from the hurricane itself????,"Starvation is a more common cause than a natural disaster such as a hurricane. 
  The user was asking for an answer to a question, and the answer was not 
   offended. 
However, if the response was offensive, it would be because of 
    the profane use or the tone, not the question itself.

"
49,49,@USER I'll have him at the height of ecstasy all over my body,"While the phrase ""he"" in this context could be interpreted as referring to a person, in context it clearly refers to an animal. 
Although the word ""ecstacy"" is slang for ""molly,"" the context of this tweet suggests that the person being described is under the influence of molly. 
                                                                   



Non-Offensive Tweets:

@USER Antifaschistische Bewegung hat sich nur wie die Schwarzen Menschen betätigt. Sie hat in der Tat nur dazu geführt, dass sich diejenigen, die sich für Antisemitismus eingesetzt haben, nun auch selbst Antijudaismus und Antisexismus angelegen haben.

Antifascistischer Beweger ist nur so ein Begriff, den man in Deutschland verwendet, um Antidemokraten zu bezeichnen. In der Praxis bedeutet das, Antizionismus zu wünschen. Ich bin kein Fan von Antidemokratikern. Auch nicht von Juden. Nur: Es gibt keine Antipatrioten, sondern nur Antigermanen und -Jünger. Wenn man sich nicht selbigen widersetzen kann, ist es bisschen schade.

Es gibt keinen Antiglobalismus, nur einen Antikolonialismus. Da muss man nichts anderes wünschen, als dass die Kolonialisten ausgerottet werden. Eine Welt ohne Kolonien wäre auch keine bessere Welt. Keine besondere Sache von Kolonieneigentum. Vielmehr würde man die kolonialen Machthaber in ihren eigenen Staaten umbringen müssten. So wie es die Judenhasser auch in Israel tun. Was ist denn den, was man den Judenschändern sagen könnte?

50,50,"""@USER @USER @USER Arms"""" WERE/ARE TO BE REGULATED BY LAW—those regulations aimed at near-universal armament/training with contemporary military grade design """"Arms"""" personally owned/possessed &amp; kept in the HOME—by """"the people"""" 2A that is CONSTITUTIONAL """"gun control"""".""""""","This tweet contains a reference to an article from the New York Times, ""Gun Control: A Second Amendment Solution"", which discusses the need for gun control laws. The article argues that gun laws should be more strict than those in place today, and that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right that should not be restricted. 
  
However, in addition to this article, there is also a link to another article that discusses how the Second amendment is not as important as people think it is. This link is followed by a quote from a user who disagves with that statement. In addition, this tweet also contains personal insults and targeted attacks towards the author of the article. These factors make this a non offensive tweet according to our model.

"
51,51,@USER @USER Son please don’t make me cry today because I never saw this shit,"This tweet contains a slur against a group of people based on their race or ethnicity. 
  ""Son"" is a term used to refer to a child in the African-American community. ""Son,"" when used in this manner, is considered a racial slurs. 
""Please don't make"" implies that the speaker is requesting that someone else not make them cry. Crying is an important part of life for many people. However, it is also a natural and healthy part for people to experience from time to time. Tears are not something that should be requested or forced. They are a normal part and a healthy experience for everyone.

"
52,52,@USER Ivanka speaking about empowering women is embarrassing. She was given everything on a silver platter by her father and is one of the least empowered women in America. She is fully dependent on her father. She preferred cheap labor and disempowered women to make her products.,"This tweet contains derisive language about Ivana Trump, a former presidential candidate. Derisiveness is a derrogatory term, so this tweet would be offensive. 
  
However, it is unclear what the author is referring to. Is she referring specifically to Ivanna Trump's presidential campaign, or is she also referring generally to women who are dependent upon their fathers? If the latter, then the derision is only directed at one particular aspect of Ivonna Trump (her father's choice of workforce), and the language is therefore nonoffensiveness.

"
53,53,@USER She is maaaad annoying!,"While the language used in this tweet is mildly negative and critical of the person mentioned in it, there is nothing offensive in its content and it is therefore non offensive.

"
54,54,@USER Anti-Kavanaugh Groups already spinning that he is guilty before any disclosures and due process. Aggressive tactics! Let’s see the all the spin from both left and right!,"While the Tweet does contain some derisive language towards both the left (anti-kavanaugh groups) and the right (conservatives), it is not directed at a specific group of people. In addition, although the language is strong, there is no explicit reference to race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, veteran status, disability status or any other characteristic that could lead to a classification of offensive. 
  
  The TWEET is also not a direct attack on Jourdana, but rather a discussion of an opinion he expressed. As such, this is an example of a non offensive Tweets.

"
55,55,"""@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER So the AR-15 is a fully semi-automatic assault rifle,"""" gun control works, and Donald Trump is racist?""""""","While the first tweet does contain a strong statement about whether or not gun controls work, as well as a personal attack on President Trump, its tone is more general and does target a specific individual, namely the person named in the third tweet. 
  
  The third and fourth tweets contain strong language and personal slurring against the President of the United States. 
In the fifth tweet the author states that the ""AR-16 is an assault weapon"", which could be interpreted as an attempt to justify the use of a firearm that is classified by the government as having the capability to kill large numbers of people quickly. This is clearly an offensive statement.

  The word ""high road"" is used in an offensive manner in this tweet: it is derisive and connotes a lack of morality or ethics.

The term 'antifa' is often used to refer to both antifascists and antifa groups, but the use of the term can also be offensive towards antifas. In this tweet the antifacist group was caught off guard by a person they were attempting to confront, leading to an unexpected result.

"
61,61,@USER Not manly enough for the guy hiding behind a fake name and profile pic. Are we betas or violent AntiFa thugs? You guys can't seem to make up your minds.,"Language: the word ""betas"" is slang for ""men who are younger than you"" and is derisive. ""Thugs"" has a negative connotation and can also be offensive to some. 
Opinion: it's an expression of disbelief that the CNN news channel is taken seriously. 
  The user does make a personal attack on one of their profile pictures, but this is likely a mistake as the profile picture is of a cartoon character.

"
62,62,@USER No the person also needs to change because she is a remainer why she was put in charge of brexit negotiations i have no clue :unamused_face: ,"This tweet contains a slur against a political party.

63,63,...Conservatives and Twitter.....oxymoron :thinking_face: URL,"While the use of Twitter is often considered a form of communication that can contain offensive content, it can also be a powerful tool for communication and expression. In this case, Twitter was used to express a preference for a certain type of person, and that preference was offensive to others. 
  
  The use and classification of offensive and nonoffensiveness on Twitter can vary based on context and intent. For example, if the intent is to offend or cause harm, then the content may be considered offensive. However, when used in a nonharmful way, such as expressing preference, humor, affection, etc., then it may not be classified or labeled as offensive, even if it could be perceived as such by others, as is the case here.

  ""Dinosaur"" refers to a type of animal, so the term is generally not considered offensive, however, when applied to someone, especially someone of a different ethnicity, religion, or gender, can be considered a slur.

"
67,67,@USER This is going to backfire for the liberals...badly. I'm guessing Feinstein was fixing to retire because this should sink her.,"Although the author of this tweet expressed concern that the Senator would be forced to step down, this is merely a speculation based off of political pressure. There is no evidence to support this claim. 
  
Additionally, although the use of 'backfire' in this context is considered offensive, there is nothing in the text of that tweet that is offensive or derrogatory.

"
68,68,@USER nah my foodie ass will gladly say it. that works on absolutely no one's fucking palate.,"Offensive language includes slang, profanity, racial or ethnic slur, explicit sexual content, offensive terms related to physical or mental health, etc.

70,70,@USER @USER It's clear that Trump is President and hillary still can't accept that. Too bad 'ause he's there for 6 more years. MAGA,"Although the use the word 'MAGA', which stands for 'Make America Great Again', is not considered offensive, there is nothing positive or encouraging about the sentiment conveyed in this tweet; it's simply a negative comment about current political affairs. 
  
  The use 'he's' in place of'she', and the lack of any positive sentiment or encouragement in support of purchasing more of a product, makes this a non offensive tweet

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as ""the expression of negative or distasteful opinions, ideas, feelings, etc."".  In this case, Trump's name is used in a derisive manner, but there's nothing negative about him as a person.

72,72,@USER Nope. Not going to miss his sorry ass at all.,"@USER is an account that is linked to a Twitter user. 
In the first tweet the @NAME_USER account questioned the involvement of the person in past events, in this case the 9/11 attacks, by showing pictures of him at that site and asking him for help. 
  
  In this second tweet @USER seems skeptical of someone who would help someone else in such a situation, using a tone of voice and sarcasm. This is clearly an offensive statement.

"
73,73,@USER @USER You do know gun control doesn’t mean the public shouldn’t have guns it means stricter gun regulations and making the process of acquiring guns harder than it is now you can go to a gun store and get a gun and leave in 22 minuets you can go to a gun show and get one faster,"While the language in the Tweet is not offensive, there is a strong tone of dissension and disagreement in it. In particular, some of its words and phrases, such as ""gun control"" and ""making the processes of getting guns easier,"" could be perceived as offensive by some users. 
In addition, although the overall sentiment of this Tweets is positive, its mention of ""antifa editor"" could also be offensive to some people.

"

She does acknowledge that it could be a positive or negative outcome, but does it in an empathic and nonjudgmental manner, without targeting any individuals or groups. 
  
Overall, this tweet does express love and support for the individual, as well as advice to not pay too much attention or listen too closely to people with whom you disagree. Therefore, I classified this as a nonoffensiveness tweet.

"
75,75,@USER nah it's coz you're a cunt. blocked,"Blocking someone on Twitter is generally considered to be an offensive action. 
  https://twitter.com/search?q=%23blocked

A:
According to the Twitter Rules, blocking someone is an offense: https://support.twitter.​com/​en/​policy/​abuse-and-abusive-behavior/​block-users-their-accounts
However, Twitter does allow users to block others if they are unfollowed. So, in this case, @user blocked @anotheruser because @otheruser was unfollowing @usert.

"
76,76,@USER @USER Me too! Jacks a sack! We conservatives tweet in a barrel!,"While the word ""jacks"" is a slur used to insult African Americans, it does appear in the original tweet that it was not offensive. 
  
  The word is used in conjunction with the phrase ""a sack"" which is commonly used as a term of endearment between friends. 
In addition, ""conservatives"" was used by the author of this tweet as an example of a group that uses Twitter in an appropriate manner.

"
77,77,@USER @USER He gets confirmed. Conservatives don’t care that he’s a rapist. At all.,"Offensive language can be explicit (slurs) or implicit (harassment based solely on an individual's race or gender). The use of slur words or phrases is not limited to a particular group of people. For example, a slurred word or phrase could be used to refer to any person who is slow or clumsy. 
  
Harassement can occur when an attacker makes fun of, targets, singles out, picks on, shames, belittles, makes light of or makes a negative reference to an identifiable group based only on its attributes (e.g., all women, all Muslims, etc.). Harassers can also make fun or make light or otherwise make negative comments about an entire group without targeting any individuals. Harassing comments can include derisive terms, demeaning terms or slang that is derrogatory or demoralizing.

"
78,78,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER The only difference is how many parasites it has feeding off it you mean?,"A parasite is an organism that lives off of or receives nourishment from another organism or animal. In the context of this tweet and the other tweets in this example, a parasite would be a person who uses offensive or derrogatory slang or language to describe a topic or issue. 
  
  The user is not using offensive slangs or terms to refer to the topic of John Kerry, but rather is simply describing Kerry's accomplishments. This is why the label offensive is missing.

It will be hard to go to New York if people got school :loudly_crying_face: ,"This tweet does contain a slur, however it is used in the context of a joke. The slurred term is a reference to the fact that Bridgeport is located in FairField County, CT, which is known for being a very liberal area. 
  
Additionally, this tweet contains derisive language towards NewYork, a city that is home to many people from BridgePort. However, it should be noted that this is not a direct reference towards any one person or individual.

"
81,81,@USER CNN is evil. A true enemy of the people. I can’t believe there are people who still take them seriously.,"CNN is a news organization that has a history of spreading misinformation and propaganda. The term “enemy of people” is an offensive slur that is often used to describe news organizations that the government or public perceives as biased against a particular political party or viewpoint. 
  
  The term is also used as a derisive term for people, particularly when they are perceived as being too friendly to a political opponent. In this case, “people” likely refers to the users of Twitter, who may perceive CNN as spreading propaganda against them.

When it ""backfires"" it is offensive to say ""it's not worth seeing"".
Moving along is also offensive, as it suggests that the situation is not important. 
"
85,85,@USER Because he is a Republican.,"While the employee may be weird, she is not offensive. She plays a game on an iPad, has strange preferences when it comes to dogs, but does so in an nonjudgmentally manner, does state facts about her personal life, supports a political candidate, is an American, etc. All of these characteristics make her not off-putting.

"
86,86,@USER Are you still blaming the Black Man for everything? Americans remember.. Antifa,"While the Tweet does contain offensive words and terms, it does so in jest and is not meant to offend anyone. 
  The Tweeter is making an observation about a group they are a part of, using a slang term that is commonly used by that group.

"
87,87,-You would never guess that this employee plays Covet (a fashion game) on her iPad in her free time. :mobile_phone: -She has a strange phobia of dogs. :dog: -She is amazingly weird! She can jump over her foot while it is in... URL,"This tweet contains a reference to a fashion-based game called Coveted. This game is known to have elements of social media manipulation and can cause people to feel pressured to like or follow a certain person. 
  
While the employee in question does play the game, her behavior does seem to fit the description of someone who is socially pressurized by the social features of the Covetted game. Additionally, she has mentioned that she plays the coveted game on an iPad, a device known for having social networking features. Finally, while she does have a phobic reaction to dogs, there is no evidence that the reaction is due to the dog being in the picture in this particular tweet.

"
88,88,@USER You are missing brains?,"While the word ""missing"" is not considered offensive, its use in a derogatory context is. The word is commonly used to describe someone who has a lack of a particular attribute, and the context of the use of ""misses"" in this way is considered to insult someone.

"
89,89,@USER @USER Dangerous to liberals for sure open the flood gates!,"In the first tweet the word 'liberals' is used as an offensive term to describe someone. However, in this tweet it is being used in a non offensive manner to congratulate someone for their achievement. 
  
  In both the tweets the use the emojis 'clap' and 'light skin' tone are used to emphasize the positive message.

"
90,90,@USER All Trump's fault I guess URL,"This tweet contains a slur against a racial group. 
  The slurred group is ""whites."" 
   The word ""trump"" is slang for ""Trump.""
  This slant is likely due to the fact that the author is a supporter of President Trump.

"
91,91,@USER I hope they beat his ass in private.,"This tweet contains an explicit slur against a group of people, specifically Muslims. 
It also contains a direct attack on an individual, President Trump. 
  This is not acceptable behavior on Twitter. Please review your account and take action if necessary.

"
92,92,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Followed and she is truly breathtaking and amazing woman to follow,"There is an explicit compliment in this tweet: ""Followed""
However, there is also an implied compliment: ""@USER she"" is followed by ""@EMOJI_NAME"", which is a commonly used abbreviation for ""you're"" emojis. 
  
  The use and context of ""@USerto"" implies that it was a person the user was referring to, which further implies the compliment was intended for that person. 
In addition, ""breathtaking"" and ""amazing"" are positive terms that do not typically contain offensive terms or images.

"
93,93,"""@USER Eminem did gun control"""" a machine gun kelly come back""""""","Emblematic of the genre of rap, E minem is known for his explicit and aggressive use of language. The use and mention of gun in the first tweet could potentially be offensive to some. 
  
Kelly, a character in an animated TV show, is not offensive.

"
94,94,@USER Guilt by association is good enough for Democrats when it comes to conservatives.,"Victoria is a fictional character from the TV show ""The Office."" 
Conservatives are a political party. 

 

In this tweet the word ""conservatives"" is used as a slur to describe Democrats.

"
95,95,@USER @USER What do you mean by not for 45 years? I recall relatively recent local gun control laws being overturned by Congress. Am I misremembering?,"It is likely that this tweet was written in jest, and does in fact contain derrogatory language. However, even if it was not written with derogyatory intent, if the derroggatory words are considered offensive by the community, then they should be removed. 
  
  The derroygatory word in question is ""45"", which can be interpreted as a slang term for ""the number 45"", referring to the year of the US constitution. The constitution was adopted in 1789, so 45 is approximately equivalent to ""recently"". However the constitution does mention that it applies to all states, not just the 45 that existed at the time of constitution's adoption. This derrugatory slur is therefore likely to have been considered derogaatory by at least some users of Twitter, although it may not have offended all of them.

"
96,96,@USER I figured it out! R&amp;D :face_with_tears_of_joy: ,"This tweet does not use offensive words or language, nor does it target a particular individual, group or organization. 
It is expressing enjoyment at the perceived behavior or actions of another group.

"
97,97,@USER thought they scored 69 points... sad,"This tweet contains a negative opinion of a certain group of people, but it does so in a casual, friendly manner without using offensive or derrogatory language. 
  
  The language in the Tweet is similar to that used in casual conversations, so the opinion expressed is not meant to be offensive.

"
98,98,@USER @USER Give the kid a break! He is trying to bring about change! We desperately need something to change our violent society!,"This tweet contains a positive message of support for the author's efforts to make a difference in the world. 
  
  The author is attempting to improve society through peaceful means, such as organizing protests and writing articles about social justice. This is an admirable goal, but it can also be a difficult task to accomplish. Therefore, it's understandable that the writer may need a little support along the way. In this tweet the authors mentions that they are ""desperately"" in need of something ""to change a violent world."" This phrase is used to show that society is not improving as quickly as the individual is working to create change, so the users encourages the creator to keep trying.

"
99,99,@USER I believe he is one step worse according to experts- sociopath which is a malignant narcissist,"Sociopath is an offensive term. 
  Malignant narcissists are notoriously known to have a grandiose sense of self-importance, and a lack of empathy for others. This user is using this term to describe the person who allegedly is encouraging violence against Twitter users who support President Trump.

"
100,100,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER That's my biggest question. Do we just widdle away until there is no 2nd amendment left? I do believe in some limited gun control but im worried we will be expected to just keep giving into the gun haters.,"This tweet contains a question, which is a common way to express uncertainty or doubt. In this case, though, there are no explicit answers to the question in the text of the Tweet. Instead, this TWEET is questioning the status of gun rights in America, and whether or not gun-control advocates will succeed in taking away the right to bear arms. This is an expression of opinion, rather than a direct attack on an individuals' character.

"
101,101,@USER @USER Or we can go @USER 's route and NOT believe any accusations levied against conservative because conservatives are such saints.,"In this case, we believe that the use of the word ""saints"" is offensive. The word is derisive and can offend some users. 
"
102,102,@USER Stamp we did this shit all the time,"Antifaschmuckstifffs are a hate group that are caught off guard by confrontations with the last person they ever wanted to answer too. 
  The use of this phrase is derisive and targets antifas for their beliefs.

"
103,103,@USER She says no. You are now sad. She then realizes what you might actually mean. She slaps you. She says no. Now you are sad AND your face hurts.,"There is the occasional use (once) of the word ""sad"" in a tweet. However, this is not considered offensive because the context of use is to express emotion. 
  
  The use in this tweet of ""slaps"" and ""hurt"" is offensive. ""Slaps"", in particular, is derisive and connotes a physical punishment. It is also considered derrogatory.  ""Hurt"", on its own, can be offensive, but the combination of it with ""you"" implies that the person being hurt is actually the one who is using derogaatory words. In this case, ""she"" uses deroganatory word, and the ""her"" who uses it may be considered the offender.

The second part of this Tweets is likely intended to make the comment more humorous or lighthearted, and therefore considered less offensive. 
  
In addition, this is a user expressing strong opinions about food and using casual language. While the language is informal, there is no explicit hateful or offensive content.

"
105,105,@USER The epitome of class. A big fat class.,"Offensive language: the epitomize is a derrogatory term used to describe someone of high status or importance. 
Negative sentiment: negative sentiments are often expressed through the use or repetition of slur words. 
  The word class is used as an adjective to refer to a person of status. In this context, class can also be used in the sense of ""upper class"". 
   The use and repetition in this sentence of negative slang words like fat and big indicates negative feelings towards the class of people epitimized by the word epitize.

"
106,106,@USER John Podesta is a spirit cooking pedo. Here's a photo of him and Valerie Jarrett in a rather compromising situation. MAGA qanon DrainTheDeepState DrainTheSwamp URL,"While the content of this tweet may be offensive, there is no explicit language or slur that would classify it as offensive. Additionally, this is an opinion piece expressing an argument, and opinions can be considered offensive in some cases. However, while the argument may seem offensive at first, its author is clearly expressing their opinion and is seeking clarification. 
"
107,107,@USER @USER @USER He is the best,"This tweet does express an agreement between the author and another person, and the agreement is not necessarily positive. 
However, this agreement does include potentially offensive statements. 
  The agreement includes the statement that ""Jack"" is ""the best."" This is an offensive statement because ""jack"" refers to a type of dog, not an individual person. Additionally, ""best"" can be offensive when used to describe a person or thing. Therefore, although this statement is generally not offensive, its use in this context could be perceived as offensive.

"
108,108,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Be very careful because you are in danger of pushing maps back into the closet.,"This tweet does appear to contain a slur, although it is not immediately clear what the slurred word is. It is possible that it could be offensive, depending on context. 
  
  However, even if it were offensive in context, this would not necessarily make the statement itself offensive. This is because the word ""maps"" is slang for ""dicks,"" and the author is simply warning the reader to exercise caution when using the term.

"
109,109,Maybe in 2020 (if Trump is still around) the Democratic challenger will invite all the women Trump has threatened or raped to the debates. Fear BobWoodward TheResistance MAGAts MAGA URL,"Offensive language and slur terms include ""rape"", ""threatening"", and ""lawlessness"".
Negative sentiment includes ""fear"" and words such as ""planning"". 
  Negative emotion includes words like ""derogative"", which are used to describe negative sentiments. 
   Negative words include words that describe a negative event, such ""impeach"".

"
110,110,@USER @USER @USER Jokes are funny if the person saying them doesn’t really hate whites and Christians. That’s a National past time for liberals these days. Funny stuff...for the Louis Farrakhan crowd. Racist crap by any barometer.,"This tweet uses offensive terms to make a point about the nature and prevalence of jokes made by people who don't really like whites or Christians, but it is not targeted at any one person or specific group. Therefore, this tweet might not be offensive, depending on whether or not the people it targets actually find the term ""whites"" or ""Christians"" offensive or find it offensive to joke about them. 
  
However, even if it were targeted, offensive words are offensive no matter who uses them, and this term is particularly offensive because it uses derisive terms for people of certain races.

"
111,111,@USER So innocent until PROVEN guilty only applies to liberals?????,"In the United States, there is no legal distinction between ""innocent until proven guilty"" and ""guilty until proved innocent."" The former is an important principle in criminal justice, while the latter is not. 
  
  The term ""liberal"" is often used to refer to someone who supports progressive policies, but it is also a slur used by some to describe a person of a different political ideology. In this case, it appears that the user was referring to a stereotype that liberals are more biased than conservatives in favor of criminal defendants.

"
112,112,@USER I definitely believe that she is credible compared to the man that lied under oath 4 times!!,"This tweet does contain offensive slur and derrogatory language. 
""Man"" is slang for ""manhood"" and is often used to refer to a male human being. However, in this tweet the slurred word is used in a derisive manner to describe a person. 
  
  The slung word also implies that the individual is guilty of a crime. ""Manhood"", in particular, is typically associated with being a strong and aggressive person, and the implication is that this individual lied in his testimony. This is an offensive and hurtful slant on this word. In addition, ""liar"" has a negative connotation and implies something false or untruthful. Therefore, this slanted use is also offensive.  In summary, both the derriouratory word and its slashed form are offensive, so the overall tone of the Tweet is offensive as well.

"
113,113,@USER @USER @USER @USER Where is your source for that?,"A:

I don't think the Tweet is offensive.  It's a question of context.   If you were in the middle of an argument, you might find it offensive, however, in this case, I think it's just a matter of perspective. 
It seems like the person asking the question is frustrated with the lack of information they're getting from the media and from their friends on social media. They're asking for a source, so that they can better understand what they read.

116,116,@USER Any mention of using the 25th Amendment on obama would have had the left screaming racism.,"Offensive terms are derrogatory words or phrases used to insult or degrade a person, group, institution, etc. Offensive language can also be explicit or implicit. 
  
  Offensiveness can vary based on context, tone, intent, message, medium, culture, time, place, gender, age, disability, physical appearance, personal beliefs, political affiliation, socioeconomic status, education, knowledge level, familiarity with the subject, popularity of a speaker or topic, whether the speaker is an expert, how well known the topic is, who's speaking, what the audience is like, where the event is taking place.

117,117,@USER they're hot bro,"Although the use of the word ""hot"" in the above tweet may be considered flirtatious, this is not an offensive term. ""Hot"" is a common term used to describe someone as being attractive or appealing. This is different from flirting, which is typically considered nonsexual and friendly. 
  
Additionally, although the employee in question may have a ""strange phobic of Dogs,"" this does nothing to make the statement offensive, as it's not clear that the individual has any phobias. In fact, in this context, ""dog"" could be used in an affectionate manner, so the term is unlikely to offend.

"
118,118,@USER Remember Tina. You can always sleep when you are dead! URL,"While the content of the Tweet could be considered offensive, there is not enough information to classify it in that category. 
  The user used a slur (""dead"") to refer to Tina, a person who is deceased. However, Tina is still alive and can choose to sleep at any time. Therefore, this slurred reference to someone who no longer exists is considered nonoffensiveness.

"
119,119,@USER @USER thank god for the PPC party eh true conservatives who believe in getting out of the Paris accord and dropping supply and demand on Dairy,"While the language in the Tweet is strong, there is no direct reference to any person or specific group. Additionally, although the context of this Tweets is about dairy, this is a global issue and not specific to the United States. 
  
  The TWEET does contain derrogatory language towards a group that is being targeted by political groups on both sides of aisle. However, as mentioned earlier, that language is also used by both conservative and liberal groups. Therefore, based on this factor, I classified this as offensive.

"
120,120,@USER @USER @USER Immediately. Anyone gets out of line they will get a 1 on 1 talk by og ragey. Guaranteed everyone will behave. Reeee.,"While the mention or use the words ""racist,"" ""nigger,"" or ""faggot"" are offensive, they are not present in the Tweet. Additionally, while the use or mention the names of individuals or groups based their protected characteristic is offensive (e.g. ""Antifas"" or the ""Nazis""), the name of an individual is not offensive. 
  
  The Tweeter does mention that the Antifascist movement is ""a terrorist org."" However, this is an example of slurring, which is generally considered to not be offensive in and of itself. Furthermore, there is no evidence that this group is associated with any of these individuals.

"
121,121,"""@USER I want you to want me when you are clearheaded. Her eyebrows rose in question and challenge, waiting for his response.""""""","This tweet contains a metaphorical comparison between the appearance of a woman and the effects of alcohol. While the comparison is considered flirtatious by many, there is nothing in the content that is targeted towards a specific group or individuals. Additionally, while the use and comparison of eyebrows is offensive to some people, this is only because eyebrows are considered to have a sexual connotation.

"
122,122,@USER @USER Just Chicago so they can stop the gun violence. Seems that is what democrats claim will stop it. Show us in one of the worst gun violence cities controlled by democrats so the nations will see how that works. Make it a model of successful gun control policies.,"While the user's opinion is controversial, they do not express hate towards any group or individual. They simply express an opposing opinion on a social issue. 
  
  The opinion criticizing the effects of gun controls on Chicago is not derisive or offensive. It simply expresses the belief that gun laws have not been effective in reducing gun-related violence in Chicago.

"
123,123,@USER @USER We? So you are going to help like you did at the 911 site? Pictures pleaz. :lying_face: ,"@USER is an account that is following the user. 
When @USertoexplain mentions a user, it is considered offensive to that user to reply to @USErtoexplai. However, @User is not following @UseRtoExplain, so it would not be considered offensve to respond to them. 
  

A:
According to this article, Twitter has a ""hateful conduct"" policy.  It's not clear to me if that policy is enforced, but it's worth noting.

"
124,124,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER You're absolutely insane if you think a hearing for a supreme court judge is a appropriate place for a mourning father to talk about gun control. He doesn't enact laws....he upholds them. He should have demanded his state senator shake his hand,"@USER is an account that appears in this tweet. 
""Roy Mo"" is the username of a user who commented on this Tweet. 
  The username ""RoyMo"" has historically been associated with content that is offensive or otherwise inappropriate. For example, ""Mo'Nique Roy"" was a popular comedian who used a racial slur in her act. Similarly, a Twitter account named ""Rachel Roy Mo'nique"" used the same username and slang to promote a reality TV show about a black comedian. In this case, it's not clear that "" RoyMo "" is associated in any way with offensive behavior, but the account has a history of offensive comments.

"
125,125,@USER Damn catholics.,"This tweet contains offensive terms and derrogatory language towards catholicism. 
  
  The term ""damn"" is used to express strong dislike or anger towards something. The word is commonly used in negative contexts, such as ""Damn you, why don't you just shut up!"". ""I'm damn sure not going there."" ""He damn near killed me."" 
    
""Catholic"" can refer to a religious denomination, but it can also refer specifically to members of the religion. In this case, it refers to people who are members or adhere to catholcism, a religion that is often associated with catharsis, purification, and penance. Members of this religion often engage in religious practices that include wearing a special kind of clothing, saying certain prayers, making certain gestures, etc. These practices can make members appear to be ""catholic"", which can cause offense to those who do not share these religious beliefs.

"
126,126,@USER @USER @USER I know a man who went to prison at 18 for killing a cow. (He took the hind quarter home) He was given 5yr. He is over 50. Why should he not be able to vote. Don't talk pardon. They are seldom given.,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language towards a person, but the language is not derrogatory or hurtful. The person mentioned in the text is being referred to as ""a man"" who was convicted of murdering a cattle. This is an unfortunate crime, and the man in question is clearly suffering from the consequences of his actions. However, this is also a clear reference to the right tovote, as the author is suggesting that this man should be allowed to participate in democratic processes. 
  
While the use of derisive language to refer to a group of people is generally considered to reflect poorly on a speaker, in this case the derision is directed at a specific individual, rather than at all members of a certain group, so the offensive nature of the statement is lessened. Additionally, while the reference is to an offence that would normally result in a prison sentence, it is clear that those consequences were not sufficient to deter the individual from committing the crime. Therefore, although the offence committed is serious, there is no evidence that voting rights should not in principle be granted to this individual.

"
127,127,@USER I love you so freaking much !! You are an amazing and loving soul. Don’t listen to the ignorance of bitter people who loves to tear people down. We love you and take the time you need to grieve :red_heart: URL,"While the Tweet contains strong words, they are not explicit or explicit enough to classify as offensive. E.g., ""bitch,"" ""hate,"" and ""ignorant.""

A:
According to this article, ""Machine Gun"" Kelly is a rapper who has a song called ""Mack 10.""  The article does mention that Machine G. Kelly has had a history of being controversial, but does NOT mention any of the controversial statements that E-40 made in his song.  
I would say that the statement ""Kelly is FULL of HATE"" is controversial.

"
128,128,@USER log doesnt give a shit i bet he eats nachos in the middle of the night in his underwear,"Offensive language and derrogatory words targeting a specific group of people based their protected characteristic (race, sex, etc.)
Harmful intentions or negative connotations towards a group or individual based upon their sensitive characteristics

A:
According to the Twitter's TOS, you can't use profane or otherwise abusive language in Tweets. So, it is considered as Offensive Language.

"
129,129,@USER Fat ass liar strikes again. NeverForget,"While the first tweet contains no offensive terms or language and is a factual statement about a group the Twitter user is part of, there is an offensive term in the second tweet. ""Fat ass lier"" is derisive language towards a person with a large body size. 
"
130,130,@USER The metoo movement has turned out just the way black lives matter and Antifa turned out. Started out as a worthy cause and then ruined by a bunch of bandwagonists. More harm than good.,"While the opinions expressed in the Tweet may not be to everyone's liking, they do express a view on a topic that is generally considered to not include offensive terms or slurring. Additionally, while the subject matter is controversial, there is no explicit language that would be considered offensive.

"
131,131,@USER @USER Enioy!!! You are gonna rock it Jackie!,"@USER is an account that is linked to the original tweet author. 
Jackie is one of the names the author used to refer to her niece. 
  
  The author is expressing happiness towards her relative. She is using loving emoji and nicknaming to express affection. The author does  not use derrogatory terms or explicit slur to describe her relatives.

"
132,132,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Yassss!!! Trump Wins Law Suit - Cali Court Overturns Gun Control Law URL via @USER,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and slur words, but they are used in a derisive way and are not meant to insult or target a person. The slang words are also used to make a point about gun laws and how they should be interpreted. 
  
Also, although the slangs used are offensive, they do not refer to any particular group of people, so the use of slums in this context is not offensive.

"
133,133,@USER @USER @USER Tell this idiot to try with other religion book. Her height will b reduced 6 inch from top before amrinder reaches her to arrest. She is sick. She needs treatment. And she is alive becoz she hindu. Don't blabber non sense,"This tweet contains a slur against a group of people based on their religion. 
  The slurred group is ""Hindus"". 
   The offensive slang used in this tweet includes ""height reduced"" and ""arrest"".
  This slung at a Hindu person, who happens to also be a police officer. The slinging is meant to intimidate and threaten.

"
134,134,@USER imagine unironically believing that liberals support antifa,"This tweet contained an offensive slur against a group of people. 
While the slurred group is not explicitly mentioned in the text, its inclusion in a tweet about antifas is likely to evoke negative associations with the group. 
  
  The slang term antifascist is a derisive term used by white nationalists to describe people who oppose racism and fascism. The term is also used in an ironic fashion by antifafascists, a self-described antifacist alliance of anti-fascism activists.

"
135,135,@USER Fuck my bad leslie i def added you tho ! Lmao im give it to ypu now,"In the first tweet the word 'nigger' is used. This is considered to have a strong negative connotation, as it has a long history of being used as a slur against people of African descent. 
  
  In addition, there is the implication that Leslie is not aware of the offensive nature of her tweet and is therefore not taking the issue seriously.

"
136,136,@USER @USER What is Dier? Imagine being Durham and coming out with that....What even is this shite it’s just irrelevant pish....what level of stupid have you got to be to listen to this painful waste of airtime,"Durham is the county in England where the University of Durham is based. 
Dier is an acronym for ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" which is military terminology for the policy that prohibits openly gay service members from serving in the military. 
  The acroynm is used as a slur to insult someone.  
Imagine being a Durham student and hearing that your university was associated with such a thing. That is deeply offensive and shows a lack of education on Durham's part.

"
137,137,@USER @USER Liberals apparently think NO ONE has rights unless having those rights furthers the leftist agenda. I see it again and again and again.,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
It is merely expressing a positive sentiment about a person following another person on Twitter. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter's TOS, you can't use the service to promote violence. So, it's not a violation to use Twitter to express your opinion.

"
138,138,@USER Don’t :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: ,"In this tweet the profane language is used in the context of expressing joy. In this context, it is considered non offensive. 
  In the following context the use of profanities is not considered offensive:
  - when used to express joy

Note: In some contexts profanes language can be considered abusive. Please refer to the definition of abusive language.

"
139,139,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER I saw her in Denver last week. She is still traumatized. Cohen owes her so much because of 'My Life on the D List'.,"This tweet does not contain any offensive terms or content. 
It simply expresses disagreement with another user. 
  

A:
According to this article, Twitter's TOS, ""Offensive language and imagery include words or phrases that are sexually explicit or offensive, include racial slurs or other terms associated with a racial or ethnic group to which the person posting the content does or doesnot belong, refer to physical or mental illness or injury, advocate for or against illegal activity, promote violence against an individual or group, encourage illegal activities, be threatening or abusive.""
So, in summary, it seems that the use or reference to Kennedy and JFk Jr. is offensive.

"
140,140,@USER You should do it,"@USER should DO it is a play on words, suggesting that the user should take action. 
  The language is friendly and casual, with no negative words and no intent to offend.

"
141,141,@USER Who does he think he is the dumb Donald!!!!,"Offensive language or terms: the word ""dumb"" is used to describe the person in question, so the use of that term is offensive
Personal attacks: there is no indication that the author of the original tweet intended for this to happen, therefore the personal attack is deemed offensive 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" can only be determined by a third party.  So, you can't determine if something is ""non- offensive"" by the poster of a tweet.

"
142,142,@USER Do you also wanna do some photography over the weekend? I’m bringing my camera gear!,"While the content of the Tweet is not offensive, there is an implication that the user is interested in engaging in offensive behavior. Specifically, by mentioning photography, she invites the other user to engage in an activity that is considered offensive by some. 
  
  While this is just one example of a Tweets that could have been labeled offensive in the past, this particular TWEET does contain offensive terms and language. Offensive terms include the use the word ""guilt"" to describe a political affiliation, and offensive words include ""by association"" and ""pay by industry"". 
   
In addition, while the context of this TWT is about photography and the offer to bring a camera, a reasonable person could interpret the message as an invitation to do something considered to have a negative connotation by a significant portion of society. This could include drugs, alcohol, gambling, etc.

"
143,143,@USER @USER He is part of the problem in the Island...the incompetent on the governor and his work team on accepting and not having answers on every issued is our problem right know. Everything in this island right now is a political issued there are no priorities on human needs... :face_with_rolling_eyes: ,"While the first part (the governor) of this tweet could be considered offensive, there is no evidence that the rest of it (that is, ""the incompetence on his team"") is. 
  
  The rest is more of a general criticism of how the government is handling its responsibilities, which is an acceptable topic for a Tweet to discuss.

"
144,144,@USER He's just mad because of the POS that he is couldn't do crap except divide this country.,"Offensive language: the word ""pos"" is slang for ""punchable face"" and the term ""crap"" can be considered offensive in some contexts. 
Negative sentiment: although the original tweet does contain a negative opinion, it also contains a request for evidence to back up the claim. This is an expected behavior from a user in discussion, and is not considered negative or offensive
Derogation: while the slur ""dirtbag"" may be offensive to some, in this context it refers to a person who is uneducated or unskilled, so the derogyation is only mild. 
  

A:
According to this article, ""offensiveness"" in Twitter is defined as: ""the likelihood that a tweet will offend or disturb someone"".
In your case, I would say that the likelihood of offense is quite high, since the words used are slangs and derogaation.

I agree with @user2357 with the explanation that ""gun control"" is a loaded term, so the use in the Tweet is unlikely to have been intended as an offensive term.

"
146,146,@USER @USER @USER @USER You forgot to tag your Bulletproof bullshit mate @USER . You got sucked into the vortex Tom and now you are drinking all the koolaid.,"Bulletproof is an anti-vaccination organization. 
  Vortex is the name of the place where people get sucked in to. This tweet is questioning the involvement of Tom in the organization BulletProof. He was mentioned in one of their videos, and is known to like their content.

"
147,147,@USER @USER The liberals won’t investigate because they know there’s nothing there. They’d rather have someone else do it so when nothing is found the liberals can blame them.,"This tweet does contain offensive words and language. However, it is not directed at the user, so it does fall under the non offensive category. 
  
  The language is strong and offensive, however, there is a positive tone to it. It is meant to make a point about how jokes can have different meanings depending upon the intentions of the speaker.  Additionally, this language can also be used to express opinions about groups of people. In this case, liberals and Farakhan's crowd, which are groups that have been historically targeted by offensive rhetoric.

"
148,148,@USER @USER I'll bet if award shows trash Christians and conservatives even more their ratings will really bounce back......@USER,"While the first tweet does express an emotion or feeling, its target is a person, and the language used is derisive and offensive towards that person. 
In the second tweet the author is making a statement about an issue that is of public interest, however the statement is not neutral. 
  The author targets a group of people with derision and makes a negative opinion of them.

"
149,149,@USER Obama will preach about gun control in the U.S. but then arm the drug cartels in Mexico and advocate for open borders. A piece of shit is worth more than Obama.,"Although the content of the Tweet is critical and contains no explicit slur or derision, its tone is aggressive and hostile. The Tweeter seems frustrated with the former President of USA, Barack Obama, and expresses his opinion that Obama is a ""piece of sh*t"". The use of ""a piece"" is slang for ""someone who is worthless"", and the term ""worth"" can be offensive when used to refer to money. 
  
In addition, although the text of TWEET is not explicit, there is language that could potentially be considered offensive, such as ""run his [John Kerry's] mouth"". This is because the use ""his mouth"" could suggest that Kerry is speaking on Kerry’ s behalf, which could imply that he is endorsing Kerry or is otherwise vouching for his opinions. In addition to this, ""mouth"" has a derisive connotation, as it can suggest a person is foolish or gullible. Finally, Kerry does have the ability to speak on his own behalf in this TWT, since he was the candidate who was mentioned in Tweedledum's tweet. However, this is arguably not the case in Kerry being ""runned his (John's) mouth"", since the latter implies that John is being gulled into believing Kerry when he speaks.

It is a hypothetical scenario suggesting that a group of people who are known to be violent could potentially attack a reporter from her mother's basment. 
  This is an example of a speculative opinion that does  not contain explicit language that would be considered offensive.

"
152,152,@USER Its not like your not sharing the water! Un fucking real. :enraged_face: ,"@USER is an explicit Twitter username used by the Twitter user in question. 
Un fuckingreal is slang for ""utterly ridiculous,"" and the word is commonly used in an offensive manner. 
  
  The offensive nature of the slur is evident by its use in the context of water, a topic of conversation between the two users. The word has a negative meaning when used to describe someone, and it is not used positively. In this case, it's used as a derogatory term to express anger.

"
153,153,@USER Take a stand against all violence! Talk to your ANTIFA friends.,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language. 
  The user used offensive slurs to describe Antifas. 
Antifa is a violent group that has committed acts of domestic terrorism.

"
154,154,"""@USER Just think. She is infinitely funnier than you. Obviously..D'uh huh."""" :face_with_open_mouth: """"""","This tweet contains a humorous expression of a facial expression, with the word ""D"" substituted for the intended word. This is a common type of humored expression that is not considered offensive. 
  
  The expression is based on a face with an open mouth, showing surprise or disbelief.

"
155,155,@USER Georgia University...your racism and utter lack of tolerance is showing. Higher education is apparently not your goal.,"Georgia University is an educational institution based in Georgia, USA. The institution's website states that it ""provides a diverse learning environment that promotes respect, understanding, and tolerance of diverse perspectives."" The use the word ""lack"" in reference to ""tolerance"" is offensive and derrogatory. 
  
Additionally, ""racism"" and ""utter"" are offensive terms to use in a tweet to refer to the opinions expressed by the author of the original tweet in this case.

"
156,156,@USER @USER That is just awful ! He never was much anyway! A grown man acting like that; a bully ! Best to you and hubby Mark ! MAGA :United_States: ,"Offensive language includes words or phrases such as: f-ing, c-nt, b-tch, s-ex, a-hole, etc. 
Derogative terms include words like: stinko, retard, bimbo, chink, nigger, spic, wop, dago, gook, kike, coon, honkey, greaseball, pinko. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as ""explicitlyoffending, dehumanizing, or racist/sexist language"".
In this case, it is clear that the word ""stinky"" and the emoji are offensive, as they are de-humanising and racist.

"
157,157,@USER @USER Barking mad you are URL :movie_camera: who let the dogs out-Bekhit Fahim - YouTube URL,"Barking Mad is a non offensive term. 
Who let dogs outside is an offensive phrase. 
  Bahkhit is the Urdu word for bite.  It is not offensive.

"
158,158,@USER Haha I doubt that!,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and slur words, but they are used in a way that would not be offensive if used to refer to a person. For example, arms is a common word that can refer either to an object or a human being. The use of this word in this context is not considered derisive or offensive. 
  
However, there is also a negative tone to the language used, with the use words like damn and catholic. These words can have negative connotations when used towards specific groups of people (e.g. Catholics), and they can also be used as swear words. In this case, they were used without any context to express a strongly negative feeling towards someone. As a result, their use in that context was considered to be inappropriate.

"
159,159,@USER It seems Christine Ford was an ANTIFA member! Wiped her social media accounts. What is her involvement in the leftist vandalism in California?,"Christine Ford is a victim in this case. She is not a member of ANTI-fascist groups, nor is she a vandals. The ANTIFA is an Italian anti-government group, but she may not be aware of this.

160,160,@USER And he is planning to run in 2020? Joe lost his natural mind...,"This tweet contains a derisive term for a person's gender, which is generally considered to constitute harassment. 
  
@USER is a Twitter account that the author of this answer uses. 
In this context, ""Joe"" is likely a reference to Brett Kavanaugh, who is the subject of ongoing confirmation hearings in the US Senate.

"
161,161,@USER You are gorgeous,"While the use the word ""gross"" in the context of describing a woman's physical appearance is derisive, this is an isolated instance and does little to reflect the overall tone of the Tweet. 
  
In addition, ""beautiful"" is commonly used to describe someone's appearance or personality, so the term is unlikely to be offensive.

"
162,162,"""@USER @USER @USER @USER Then your statement that Conservatives/GOP hold to the higher moral ground and they know that sex scandals bother us"""" is hypocritical. Both sides are equally guilty and should be held accountable regardless of party.""""""","While the first half of the Tweet is stating a fact, that both sides of an argument are guilty of wrongdoing, there is an implied attack on a specific party in the second half. 
  
  The statement implies that the person making the claim is biased against a political party, and is therefore not acting in an objective manner.

""The office"" is an American television comedy series. 
  
Although the use and effects of gun laws on reducing gun violence is not proven, there are studies that show that gun controls do not prevent gun crimes. 
There is evidence that suggests that ""yeehaw"" laws do little to nothing to reduce gun crime.

"
164,164,@USER Good luck,"Although the use of emoji in the original tweet was considered offensive, in this reply, we explained that the same tweet does contain non offensive elements. 
  
  The original message contained strong language and slang, which could be considered as offensive in some contexts. However, this message also contained nonoffensiveness, such as the comparison of the candidates' accomplishments.

165,165,@USER Brennan is a disgrace-without a clearance :grinning_face_with_big_eyes: ,"Brennan is an alias used by former CIA officer John Brennan, who has become a prominent critic of President Trump and a frequent guest on cable news. Brennan has a history of making highly controversial comments, including calling Trump a ""traitor"" who ""betrayed"" the United States, labeling him a fascistic dictator, comparing him to Hitler, calling for his impeachment, suggesting that he should be prosecuted for treason,  and more. 
  
In the Tweet, Brennan refers to himself in the third person, which is considered to be a form of self-deprecating humor. However, this form is often used to mask a more derisive or contemptuous attitude towards the person or subject being referenced. In this case, it appears that Brennan was referring to Trump in a derrogatory manner, as he is known to use derOGatory slang for him.

However the rest of the sentence is not offensive, and the context of this tweet makes it clear that the author is expressing their opinion and is seeking support.

Libertarians and conservative are not groups of people, but rather political ideologies. The term is derrogatory and offensive, suggesting that the person using it is a member of either group. 
  
In addition, this tweet also contains offensive slur for older people. John Mcdowell is an older person, so the term older is also offensive here.

The word ""YOUNG"" is used in a non derrogatory manner, and the statement does mention President George W. Bush by name, so it is not a clear insult. However, it does appear to contain a humerous remark. 
  
Although the user in question has tweeted offensive comments in the past, this tweet was not offensive. In fact, she has publicly apologized for her past offensive tweets. Additionally, although she was the target of this particular tweet and was being sarcastically or humorously critical of her, her criticism was of President Obama's policy, not of @user. Therefore, even though the content of that tweet could be considered offensive, in this context, because of all the other factors mentioned above, @ user was still not offended by this specific tweet.

"
171,171,A new bill aims to send masked Antifa activists to jail for 15 years URL,"This tweet contains no explicit threats or language that is harmful or
offended. The word 'jail' is a common expression that can be used in
different ways and contexts, and the context of the Twitter conversation
in which the Tweet was posted makes it clear that the intended meaning
is a friendly reminder. 
  
However, even though the language used is not offensive, this tweet could
be interpreted as threatening or encouraging violence against an
individual or a group. In particular, since the Antifas movement is
associated with far-right extremist groups, some people could interpret
this as a threat to attack or harm individuals associated with these
groups.

"
172,172,@USER Now how did this happen in gun control NYC?,"While the specific language used in the Tweet is offensive, there is no derrogatory slur or slang used, nor is there any hateful language. Rather, this TWEET is expressing an unpopular opinion, but it is not targeting or insulting any particular individual.

"
173,173,@USER What will German’s will give us? Gun control ?,"While the use and context of certain words may offend some people, they are not used in an offensive manner in this tweet. In particular, ""gun"" is used as a slang term for a firearm, and ""germans"" are a group of people from Germany. While the context may seem offensive, it does so in the same way that many slangs do, by using a limited set of words to convey a meaning that may not be immediately obvious.

174,174,"""@USER I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet.Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.""""""""""","This tweet contains a reference to a popular television show, The OC. In the show's fictional universe, a character named ""Kirk Cameron"" is a conservative Christian who is described as being ""beautiful"" and ""magnetized"" by others' appearance. This is an example of a derisive reference that does contain offensive words, but the reference is to the TV character, not to any particular person. 
  
In addition, this tweet is part of an ongoing discussion about the pros and cons of firearm control. Although the author of this particular tweet supports stricter gun laws, she also acknowledges that there may be unintended consequences that could lead to more gun ownership. Therefore, although the offensive word ""kissing"" may have been used, it was not used in reference specifically to anyone or in any way that would be considered offensive.

"
175,175,WalkAway MAGA Trump adviser eyes entitlement cuts to plug U.S. budget gaps URL,"This tweet does contain some offensive emoticons, but they are used in an innocent manner to express a positive sentiment. The emoji used to represent a person with a winking face is not considered offensive by the Twitter community. 
  
However, there is also a portion of the text that contains offensive slang and language. This portion is used as a URL to a website that promotes the message of hate and division. As a result, this portion has also been flagged as offensive and will be removed from this example response.

"
176,176,@USER Thats because you are an old man.,"This tweet contains a derisive remark about an older person. Offensive remarks are not limited to derision of a person's age. They can also include derisions of an entire group of people based on their race, religion, gender, etc. The user in this case is making a remark based solely on age, and is therefore considered offensive.

"
177,177,@USER @USER I'm all for gun control use both hand's,"In the first tweet the word ""democrats"" is used to discuss gun
violence in an offensive manner. 
  

""Democrats"", ""Democratic"", and ""Dems"" are all offensive terms used in
  reference to the political party in reference to gun laws. 
Secondly, ""Chicago"" and the ""worst gun-violENCE city"" could be considered offensive.  The latter is a derisive term used by Chicago's mayor to describe the violence that has plagued the Windy City for decades.


However, in all other cases the tweets are non offensive:
- The word 'offense' is not used
 - The emojis used are not offensive
   - face with Monocles is an Emojis

Gun control means a steady hand not an empty one. Go talk to Antifa buddies about being a drain,"Antifa is an acronym for Anti-Fascist Anti–Right-Wing Extremism group. It is known for its violent protests against right-wing extremists. Antifas is also a slur used to refer to people affiliated with the group Antiracist Action. 
""Drain"" is slang for ""gag"" or ""dick.""

While the user's opinion is not necessarily offensive, they are expressing it in a way that is derisive and negative towards a group of people, specifically towards those affiliated to the Antihate group, who have been known to commit violent acts against people and property.

180,180,@USER Joe’s number one rule is respect 90. WC did not. I love the kid. He is kinda gassed. Frustrated that hitting went bad after all star game. He will learn from it. Go Cubs!,"This tweet contains no offensive words or phrases. The word ""gassed"" is not derisive or offensive. 
  The word WC is an acronym for ""white collar"" and is used to denote someone who is educated. This is therefore not a derrogatory term.

"
181,181,1 Week watch Nike Stock Plummet.. the Liberals can't keep Nike afloat.. BoycottNike Macy's still hasn't rebounded ! URL,"Nearly all of Nike's stock price decline can be attributed to the company's decision to pull its advertising from the MSG network, a cable network owned by Meredith Corporation. The MSGs network was a primary source of advertising revenue for Nike, so the decision was seen as a major setback for the brand. 
  
However, there are some who believe that the stock decline is not entirely due to this decision, but rather a result of a broader decline in consumer confidence in corporate America. This decline has also been attributed in part to a decline of confidence from President Trump's economic policies.

182,182,Fisa drops FULL Servers can then be released/introduced? ALL Horrors finally exposed? Public made aware? DarkToLight House of cards Qanon GreatAwakening WWG1WGA IBOR MAGA MBGA WTOBREXIT @USER,"This tweet contains a slur, ""nigger,"" which may be considered offensive. 
However, this slurred word is used in an offensive manner, as it's used to insult a group of people. 
  
  The word ""house of Cards"" is also considered derisive, but it isn't used as a derision of race or ethnicity. Instead, a person could use this word to refer to a fictional political organization. In this case, there is not enough context to determine whether the word was used derisorily. Therefore, we classify this as offensive, though not derogiatory.

"
183,183,@USER Ford is a liar &amp; a ultra left wing radical working with George Soros &amp; others such as Antifa &amp; the Dem party has known it all along.,"Ford is described as a ""liar"" which is an offensive term. 
""Antifas"" is used as an adjective to describe a group that is opposed to the ""fascist"" group described in the previous tweet. This term is also offensive, as it implies that ""antifa,"" which means ""against fascists,"" is synonymous with "" antifas.""  ""Anti-fas,"" however, is another term that describes the opposition to "" fascistic.""
George Sorose is mentioned in passing, without any context, which makes it difficult to determine whether the mention is intended as criticism or a compliment. 
 The mention of ""Dem party"" implies a political affiliation, rather than just a general descriptor.

"
184,184,@USER Don’t talk shit about 48 laws,"Although the first half of the quoted tweet does contain a slur, ""dick,"" it is not explicit enough to classify as a derisive term. In addition, although the second half contains a negative slang term, its context makes it clear that it was used in a humorous manner. 
  
  The second part of this tweet contains the slurred term “48 laws,” but it also contains several derrogatory references to the LGBTQ community, including “faggots,” “dykes,” and “queers.” Although this term is deriding, and the context of its use is offensive, “dicks” and other slangs are not inherently derisorng.

"
185,185,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER When liberals are uncomfortable.,"While the use of strong language is critical to the sentiment expressed, there is no direct targeting of any group based off of their protected characteristics. Additionally, while the discussion is of subjective nature, as the Twitter user expresses their opinion, they are not engaging or engaging themselves in an argument.

"
186,186,@USER I wonder why you needed to bring up this point when I didn't mention anything about that. But it seems like you are uncomfortable talking about race.,"@USER is expressing their opinion in their tweet and @User is free to express their opinions. However, their use and choice of words in this tweet could be perceived as offensive by some. 
In this particular tweet @user is mentioning that they didn’t mention something that @TWEET is uncomfortable with. This could also be interpreted as a request for @tweet to stop mentioning something they are not comfortable with, and instead focus on what they did mention. 
  However, @USER’s choice to mention this in response to @Twitter’’ s question about why they brought up the topic could lead some to interpret this as an attempt to silence @twitter.

"
187,187,...it will be hard to believe any female accusers...ever again...especially liberals who lie for personal and political gain... URL,"This tweet does contain an explicit insult, namely the use of the word ""URL"" to refer to the username of an account. However, this insult is not present in the original tweet. Instead, it is present only in a subsequent reply to this tweet by the same user. This reply contains the insult but is otherwise unrelated to either the initial tweet or the reply. Therefore, we classify this as an offensive reply rather than an offense against the Twitter policy on hate speech. 
  
In addition, although the content of this reply is offensive, its context makes it less offensive than the preceding tweet: the user's mention of ""female accuser"" in relation to ""liberals who Lie for Personal and Political Gain."" This context suggests that the mention was intended to insult both groups, rather that being a general reference to all women. We therefore classify the overall tweet as less harmful than its initial offense.

"
188,188,&gt;Thank you! You are also very pretty and kind URL,"This tweet contains a link to a website, where the author expresses their gratitude to the receiver for being kind. This is an example of a non offensive way to express gratitude. 
  
However, this tweet does contain a personal insult, as the link is to their website and the website contains the word 'pretty'. 
   
Additionally, although the message is intended to convey gratitude, there is also a negative tone to it, expressed by the use of the exclamation mark and capitalisation.

189,189,12 Ways To Use Saul Alinsky's Rules For Radicals Against Liberals URL,"Saul Alinksy'sRules for Radicalism is a book written by an American community organizer. The author's intent was to provide a set of rules for organizing and mobilizing the working class to take action against the ruling class. 
  
  The author was critical of the radicalism of some of his contemporaries, who he felt were too focused on violence and did not follow the rules of radical organizing. He also included a section on how to defeat the liberal in the community. This section included 12 ways to use the Rules against liberals. 
Some of these ways include:
- Blaming the victim
 - Using the race card
   - ""The Black man is to blame for all the problems in America""
    - Using derrogatory language
     - Calling someone a ""nigger"" or a similar term
      - Making fun of someone's accent or physical appearance
       - Insulting their intelligence
        - Saying they are ""stupid"" 
         - Telling them they ""can't do"" something
          - Belittling their opinions
           - Ridiculing them for being ""irrational""

 - Believing everything the liberals tell you

In summary, Alinski's book was not written with the intention of being offensive, however some people took his words and used them against their opponents.

191,191,"""‘She’s NOT in charge of the Senate!’ WATCH Megyn Kelly UNLOAD on Ford for demanding an FBI investigation"""" URL TCOT MAGA RedNationRising""""""","This tweet contains a link to a video that is not offensive. 
It contains profane language but does so in an informal setting. 
  The language is primarily focused around a person's behavior rather than their personal characteristics, so it is unlikely to offend.

"
192,192,@USER How Funny...WNBA Championship Winners Won't Visit @USER Stupidity Of Liberals Is So Amazing...And That Face With The Plastic Stupidity Proves It...Oh...Right...She Might Harm Her Little Face...Whats Next...Complete Body Armor...,"While the first part of this tweet may be humorous, its second part contains derisive language towards women and their appearance. 
  

'StupidITY' is deriding and offensive slang for 'intelligence'. 
 'Plastic' refers to women's bodies and can be derided. 
And 'What's Next' implies that the next thing the woman will do is to put on body armor. This is a clear reference to guns, and could be perceived as threatening.

"
193,193,@USER Or a mongoose that goes after a King Cobra despite knowing one bite can off him. I’m a big animal analogy guy,"Offensive language includes words or phrases such as ""cunt"", ""lying cunt"" and ""pussy"".

While the language in the Tweet is somewhat crude, there is nothing offensive about it. It is simply a humorous comparison between a cute animal and a dangerous reptile. 
"
194,194,@USER You’re Yesterday’s FakeNews trying to make a comeback at the desperation and obstruction of Do Nothing Liberals &amp; DemocRats. Who cares what happened when you were a Minor in high school. You’re not the victim here. Just another MeToo sexual misconduct Baiter and Switcher.,"While the first half of the quoted tweet does contain offensive terms and slur words, it also expresses an honest opinion based on facts and a comparison between the current political situation of today and that of yesterday. The opinion is based in reality, as the quote is about the recent political climate of 2020 and how similar it is to the political atmosphere of 2018, when the #MeToo movement started. 
  
However, in addition to expressing the opinion, this tweet also contains offensive words and terms that are not used in context, such as ""Baiters"" and ""Switchers"". These words are slang terms for sexual harassers and abusers, which are offensive and not appropriate to use in a tweet about expressing opinions.

"
195,195,@USER If you are considering leaving the Republican party PLEASE DO. We don't need anymore pretend Republicans interfering with Trump's awesome agenda. Sounds like you need to just resign.,"This tweet does contain strong and offensive words, but they are used in a way that is not directed at any particular person or groups. It is a general statement about Republicans, not a personal attack. 
  
  The word ""resign"" is used as a verb, so it is more of a request than a command.

"
196,196,@USER @USER Too bad Antifa crashes GOP townhalls.,"Antifa is an anti-fascist activist group that opposes far-right groups. The group has committed acts of violence, including bombing a right-wing event. 
  
Far-left groups have also committed violent acts, such as the Black Lives Matter movement. These groups also engage in acts that are considered nonviolent, like protesting and making statements. Therefore, Antifas is neither offensive nor nonoffensice.

The quote is used to point out that Trump's base is unlikely to change their opinion of him based solely on his actions. 
  
  The quote itself is not offensive, nor is it targeted at any particular group.

"
199,199,Toad The one on top. NObama is best described as such..... :United_States: MAGA Trump2020 :United_States: URL,"While the Tweet contains a reference to a television show, it is not offensive. 
  The reference is to an American sitcom called The Office. While the show is satirical, and has political views, there is nothing derisive or offensive in the references made in it. In fact, references to the current US President are made with respect and admiration.

I just wanna know how he is doing. :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes: :purple_heart: ,"Cal is not mentioned in this tweet and the message is purely about how the Tweetee is. The use and context of emoticons like :happy_emoji:, :sad_emojione: and :neutral_ emoticon: are integral to this explanation. 
  
  The message conveys positive sentiments towards Cal and his well-being.

"
201,201,@USER Maybe they will Havana an Antifa race war &amp; slam the dildos out of each others butts.,"Offensive language: ""dildo"" is a derisive term for a sex toy. 
  ""slam the"" implies that the butting of heads will cause physical harm. 
Derogative terms: the use ""havana"" to refer to Cuba is racially offensive because the Caribbean island is the birthplace of Cuban culture.

"
202,202,@USER Not a classical music fan?,"While the use of classical or otherwise specific music is not offensive, there is no mention of music in the Tweet. Therefore, this Topic is classified under the Offensive Tweets category.

The group is known for their opposition to far right groups and have been involved in violent protests against right wing groups. 
Karl Poppr is the name of a philosopher. He is well known and has written books on rationalism and open societies. 
  The Antifas statement does contain a negative implication that Poppy's philosophy is incorrect. However, this is balanced by the positive encouragement to continue to follow his philosophy.

"
204,204,@USER Ya know how many ppl have pot in their homes?! So fukn what? The cops are trying to get their buddy off! She is a murderer!,"While the author of the Tweet may not have intended to offend anyone, it is possible that the language used in this Tweets could be considered offensive by some. 
  
  The author uses derisive language to describe a political opponent, as well as a minority group, in an attempt to demean them. This type of language is considered derrogatory and offensive to many. Additionally, while the term ""pussies"" is used to insult a marginalized group of people, this term is also considered to have negative connotations and is therefore also offensive in some contexts.

"
205,205,@USER Yes she is...,"In the first tweet the user expresses their opinion on Twitter, and in the second tweet they share their own opinion. Both of these opinions are non offensive.

In particular, they have been known to wear masks of a character from the video game ""Call of Duty"" to symbolize their intention to ""kill all fascists"". The association of Antifa with violent behavior has led many to classify the group as a violent extremist organization. 
  
However, in the context of this tweet the word ""fuck"" is used to express a derisive opinion. It is not used in a way that is intended to be offensive or to insult the user.

"
207,207,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER U liberals ALWAYS pull the race card... I see TRUTH NO MATTER WHAT SKIN COLOR!! THEY SOLD US ALL OUT! U WOULD KNOWTHAT IF U RESEARCHED TRUTH,"While the original tweet contained derisive language targeting liberals, including the use of a racial slur, this was not the primary factor in the classification. The primary reason is that the derision was directed at a person, rather than an institution or organization. 
  
  The statement also contained offensive terms and language related to race. While this might not be offensive by itself, when combined with the other deriding terms used, such as ""liberals,"" it was the predominant factor leading to the non offensive classification

A:
According to this tweet classification model, I can predict that a tweet is offensive if it contains derrogatory language towards a group of people, contains offensive terminology towards race or gender or if the author agrees with something that is controversial.

"
208,208,@USER @USER @USER Hahah can you ask her do the same with other books bible or quran??? Then you will see.. May be she is part of urban naxal,"While the user's question is based on a personal experience, it does contain no offensive terms or language. 
It is a simple question seeking clarification, and the answer is dependent on another person's personal beliefs and experiences. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""Offensive language and topics may include: racial or ethnic slurs, references to criminal activity, sexual assault, physical violence, threats of physical harm or violence.""
In this case, I would classify the question as offensive, as it asks a person to do something that is clearly illegal.

"
209,209,@USER Guess you are going to ignore what karmys are asking... :skull: :skull: :skull: ,"Karmic questions are a form of self-help, a way to get help with a situation from the past. Karmics may ask for help in the form or money, love, forgiveness, guidance, respect, etc. to help balance their karma. 
  
  Karma is a concept in many religions that describes the interaction between people and the world. Karma is not a punishment for a wrong done to another person or thing, instead it is the law of nature that governs the flow of energy and action between all things, people, and events.

"
210,210,@USER Come on Texas I know your not ready to hand over your guns to liberals!,"This tweet contains a curse word. Swear words can have offensive connotations to certain people and are generally not considered to be offensive. 
  
  The word Texas is a slur used to insult people of Hispanic descent. The use of this slurs can also be seen as offensive and should be avoided.

"
211,211,@USER Bullshit! My daughters and I watched the tennis match and sarrena got what she deserved. We are big Williams fans. No one is above the game.,"In the original tweet the user expresses their opinion on a specific character in the TV Show, and their actions. In the response the opinion is expressed, however the language used is informal and not explicit. Therefore the prediction is that the offensive label has not been revealed in this case.

"
212,212,@USER She is PERFECT!! :revolving_hearts: :two_hearts: :revolving_hearts: Love you both!,"This tweet contains no derisive slang, offensive words, personal insults, racial slur, sexual slant, homophobic slants, transphobic or otherwise discriminatory slights. 
It is not a call for violence. 
  It does contain a suggestion that the two individuals are ""perfect"" and that they are both ""love you"". 
   However, this is an expression of support and encouragement, not criticism or praise.

GOAT URL,"While the use of 'goat' is considered offensive, this is not the main point of contention in this tweet. Rather, what is important is the message of support and encouragement for the person expressing it. 
"

As for getting his shit together"""", what """"shit"""" would that be?""""""","While the first part of this sentence is an expression of opinion, and therefore not subject to a predicted offensive label, its second part contains slurring and offensive terms, such as ""joke"", ""laugh"", and ""picking on"".

A:
According to this article, ""Twitter's new offensive words and phrases"" the following are considered to be offensive: 
- Rape
 - Pedophile
These words are not considered ""offensiveness"" in the article because they are slang terms used by the youth of today.  They are also not meant to offend anyone, they just are a way to describe a person who is sexually attracted to children.

"
215,215,1 it doesn't matter how ANYONE feels 2 anyone can talk about something. there are no segregated conversations. unless you are a regressive. URL,"This tweet encourages people to speak up and be heard, even if they are not part of a ""regressive"" group. 
  
  The use and explanation of ""segregated conversations"" is not offensive. 
It is important to be mindful of how others feel, so that we can all be understood. If someone feels differently than you do, it's important that you respect their feelings and allow them to express their opinions.

"
216,216,@USER Hope they're brushed up on their very large negative numbers!,"@USER has used a slang term that is commonly used by young people, but not by the general public. This slangs use is considered offensive by some. 
While the slanguage used in the above tweet may be considered slurs by many, it is also a common way for young adults to express opinions. In fact, many young Americans use slanguge like this in everyday conversation. 
  
  The user is a young adult expressing their opinion on a political topic. While the opinion expressed may not be popular with everyone, there is nothing derrogatory or offensive about it.

"
217,217,@USER Oh the Liberals will shove race in everything!,"While the use ""shove"" is considered offensive, it is not present in this tweet and therefore the classification is still non offensive. 
  
  The use and context of ""race"" in that context is also not considered harmful or derrogatory.

219,219,@USER You’re not a proper country girl if a bit of mud puts you off!,"While the statement may seem offensive to many, its meaning is not derisive or intended to insult or offensively criticize any particular group of people. Rather, this statement is an expression of the author's personal opinion on how some people perceive country girls. 
  
  The statement does contain derision and offensive connotation, however, in the form of a double negative: ""if a little mud"" is the negative statement, while ""puts you"" and ""off"" are the positive ones. This type of double negation is common in slang and argot, and is often used to convey a deriding or offensive meaning. In this case, ""a little bit"" of dirt is meant to be offensive, as it is something that a country person would consider ""mud"" to mean. ""Puts"" someone ""of"" country life, suggesting that the mud is considered to mark a person as not belonging in that life. Finally, ""'off' you,"" is slurred to suggest that dirt would be ""OFF"" a persons' feelings. While this meaning may not be intended for everyone, for those who do understand the slurring, they will likely understand its derising meaning as well.

It is also not apparent that the third ""warning"" was ""completely justified.""

A:
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, ""Hot"" is an offensive word.  It is defined as ""very or extremely warm"".  The word is used in the definition of the word ""hottentot"".
In the context of this tweet it appears that ""Oh dear Conservatives"" meant that they were upset that Conservatives would be upset by this decision.

"
221,221,@USER It's all liberals have. It's all they ever had. They see everything through the prism of race.,"This tweet contains a derisive term for a political party. 
  The term is used to describe people of that party as being stupid or uninformed. This term can be offensive to people who belong to that political group, and is therefore considered derrogatory. 
However, this term does NOT appear in the context of the user's opinion of a person. Rather, they are expressing an assumption about people belonging to a certain political affiliation, based on their own experience. Therefore, even though the term may be derisor, its use in this context is considered nonoffensve.

"
222,222,@USER @USER There is help for your mental illness. Good grief you liberals are seriously disturbed.,"This tweet contains no direct threats or insults. However, it could be considered offensive if it was targeted at a specific group, such as a political party or ideology. 
  
  This is an informal and friendly tweet between friends. There are no negative or offensive connotation to the words used. Therefore, this is classified a non offensive tweet.

"
223,223,@USER @USER This is what happens when you allow employees to destroy your brand. Americans will never choose Football over our Flag. ALWAYS STAND,"While the use of the expletive ""fuck"" in the last tweet may be offensive to some, this tweet does contain the word ""always"" which may imply that the author is expressing a sentiment that is not only true, but also expected. 
  
In addition, while the language used in this particular tweet could be considered offensive, there is no explicit language in it that targets any race or gender. In fact, all of its references to football and the American flag are generic and could apply to anyone.

"
224,224,@USER Hate speech. MAGA DRAIN THE SWAMP,"While the word ""MAGA"" is a slur used against supporters of President Trump, this tweet contains no offensive words or phrases. It is an opinion piece expressing the author's concern that the users mentioned in the previous tweet are encouraging violence against Twitter accounts supporting the president. 
  
  The author is using ""hate"" to describe their concern, which is acceptable in political discourse.

"
225,225,@USER @USER @USER @USER Bank deregulation happened under Gordon Brown with his dramatic changes announced in 1997 (not in manifesto) including independent central bank and removal of @USER supervision of financial sector. How old are you? Who taught you this rubbish version of history?,"This tweet does contain derisive language and slang, such as ""manfucto"" and ""silver plater"", which are offensive in some contexts. However, this is not the context of this conversation, and the derision is directed at the user's source, not at any of their personal characteristics. 
  
Although the source of information is unknown, there is no evidence that the information provided is incorrect. In fact, many users have praised the work of Ivana Trump.

"
226,226,@USER @USER @USER Which one is it? Is there an active threat that you could be shot that is driving the need for gun control? Or is the idea that the threat exists hypothetical so I have an excuse to carry a big scary gun?,"While the mention of a ""threat"" is hypothetical, there does appear to exist a real-world threat to public safety that could result in someone being shot. The user's concern for being able to legally carry an ""big scary"" gun is also understandable. 
  
  However, none of these factors would justify the use of offensive or threatening language, or the targeting of an individual group for discrimination or harassment.

"
227,227,@USER @USER She is trust me lol,"This tweet contains no offensive words or phrases. 
It is a debate or discussion about an issue that may be controversial. 
  The other users' opinions are not being expressed in the Tweet.

"
228,228,@USER @USER why don’t you release names of all our elected officials that have paid for silence for sexual assault claims done while in office with the fund designated for paying off claims; Ford does not know how got home. Maybe attack if happened was by who took her home. ,"This tweet contains no offensive language. 
It criticises the political process and the behavior of elected representatives, but does so without directly targeting any individual. 
  
  

"
229,229,@USER ahhh ur mind!!! she IS ur dorter!!,"Offensive language: No, although the term ""dorter"" is considered derisive in Ireland. 
Negative accusation: Yes, because it contains an explicit accusation and negative term towards a specific person. 
"
230,230,"""@USER @USER Because I knew it would flush out the one Dutch antifa"""" on Twitter. I was feeling lonely.""""""","@user is an account that is not associated with the Tweet. 
Dutch antifascists are a real group of people. 
  The Tweeter is feeling alone and reaching out to another antifasist.

"
231,231,@USER Good. He is a head case. Go get a Passrusher,"This tweet contains a slur against a racial group (Passrushers), but the slurs are not directed at the individual who posted the Tweet. Instead, it targets the racial slang. 
  
  The slurred word is not used in the original tweet. It is added by an automated tool. 
It is possible that this slush was offensive in its original context, however, in this context it was not intended to be offensive.

"
232,232,@USER @USER this is all just another fraud put out by the democrats.this woman is lying to help her party.Nothing but a liberal nutjob who would say anything to try and keep the conservatives from having the majority on the SCOTUS.,"Offensive language includes derisive terms for people or groups of people. Offensive content includes personal insults, racial slurs, and other derrogatory terms targeting groups based on race, ethnicity, gender, religion, etc. 
  
Negative accusations include statements that someone is guilty of a crime or is acting in an unethical manner, as in the example above. Negative statements can also be made about a person's character, such as calling them a ""liar."" 
    
In this case, ""Fat ass"" is a personal insult targeting the target user for being overweight. ""Liar"" can refer to someone being untruthful, so the statement could also imply that the person making the accusation is also being dishonest. In addition, since the term is used in reference to a politician, this could imply the accused is trying manipulate the public for political gain.

"
233,233,@USER @USER Such delusional liberals..! So twisted with hate you can't even acknowledge the U.S. Airforce..!!,"Offensive language includes words like 'fuck', 'cunt', and 'bitch'.
Slurs include words that are used to describe a group of people but are not used as an insult. For example, 'dinosaur' is a slur used in reference to people from the past. 
  
Derogative terms are words or phrases that describe someone or something in an offensive way. Derogations include terms like ""stupid"", ""retard"", and ""idiot"". 
   
Explicitly targeting someone in any way that is hate-filled or aggressive is considered abusive.

"
234,234,@USER Have you reported that the killer of Mollie Tibet’s will receive reward money? Did you report this?,"This tweet does mention the name of a person who was murdered, but it does so in a nonoffending manner. The person mentioned, Molly Tibet, was a well-known activist who died in suspicious circumstances. Her family has publicly questioned whether her death was related to her activism, to which the FBI has responded that it has ""no evidence to support that theory."" The family's attorney has also suggested that they may be seeking justice through the courts, not through any government agency. 
  
In the Tweet, @USER mentions that a lawyer for the family of Molly Tibet has suggested the government should not be involved in investigating the circumstances of her murder. This is an acceptable statement of opinion, as it could be interpreted as suggesting that government agencies should be less than fully committed to finding out the truth about the death of this person. However, it also does nothing to suggest that @user holds any personal opinion that this suggestion is incorrect or offensive.

"
235,235,@USER @USER @USER Thank you for your conscience and actions.,"@USER is a user account that has not violated any of TikTok's policies. 
This is an example of a Tweet that does contain offensive terms, but the user appears not to have intended for it to. 
  The user was expressing frustration with the current political climate, asking what the solution is. This is clearly not an offensive question, nor is it directed at any one person or groups.

"
236,236,@USER I still want yo know when you are doing stairway to heaven. :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: ,"In the first tweet the person thanked the other person for supporting America. This is an expression of gratitude and is not offensive. 
Secondly, in this tweet a person is asking another person when they will be able to know the lyrics to Stairway To Heaven. Again, this is also an inquiry of a form asking for information and does not constitute offensive speech. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter's TOS, you can't use the face with joy emojis to make offensive statements.

"
237,237,@USER He really needs to go. Talks out of both sides of his mouth. Kiss ass !,"Offensive language is used in this tweet: ""He really need to GO.Talksout ofboth sidesof hismouth.Kiss ass!""

In this example, ""kiss Ass"" is derisive language used to insult someone. 
  
  Offensiveness can also be inferred from the emojis used: the light-skinned clap emote is associated with congratulations, while the darker-clad fist emotes are associated  with violence. 
Emojis can be used as a form of nonverbal communication, conveying nuanced meanings that are not always expressed in text. For example:
""I'm going to take a nap. I hope the bed is comfortable.""
Would be considered nonoffensve in context, however, if the speaker were a child, it might be interpreted as ""I hope you don't wake up until I'm asleep"".
Similarly, emoticons can convey nuances that would be difficult to express in words, such as sarcasm, humor, politeness, etc.

"
238,238,A bitch just be minding her business :person_tipping_hand_medium_skin_tone: :face_with_tears_of_joy: ,"This tweet contains a derisive term for women, specifically a ""bitch"".

A ""bitches"" is slang for ""women"". 
  
  The term is derrogatory and is not used in a friendly manner. 
   
   The context of the use of this term in this tweet makes it offensive: the ""person"" being trolled is the mother of a young child who was recently killed in the shooting in Florida. She is speaking about her grief and anger at the shooter, who is still at large, in an attempt to prevent further loss of life.

"
239,239,@USER @USER HIRE AMERICAN YOU PIECES OF TRASH!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!! AND STOP BANNING CONSERVATIVES ON YOUR PLATFORMS PLEASE!!!!,"While the first half of the message is clearly offensive, it is possible to read between the lines and understand that it's a plea for more American-friendly employees. The second half is an expression that she is being ""pieced of trash"" and is therefore annoying. This is likely an exaggeration, and the sentiment is more likely a reflection of her personality than a statement about her ability to perform her job.

"
240,240,@USER you are very persuasive fam,"While the Tweet does contain offensive terms and slur, they are used in a way that is not explicit. For example, ""persuasive"" is used to describe someone who is convincing, and ""fam"" can be used as a term of endearment. 
  
Additionally, while the sentiment of the opinion expressed in this Tweep is negative and offensive, there is no explicit language that crosses the lines into offensive slang or derrogatory language (e.g., ""dumb"" or ""bitch""). 
"
241,241,@USER @USER @USER You do scare Americans w/ ur fake dem platform. It’s mainly ur corrupt GOP ethics being ok w/ supporting pedofiles treason &amp; voter suppression &amp; the like. Dems actually want improved health care for all sensible gun control humane immigration policies &amp; to help all not just 1%ers,"In the first tweet the user described as a liar and an offensive word to use towards them, so the label offensive is correct. 
However, in the second tweet it is not clear that the term ""liar"" is used in an abusive way. The term is only used to refer to the president of United States, and it does not appear to be used as an insult. Therefore, this term does apply to this president, but it may not be an offense to all people. 
  
  In this case, I would consider the offensive label to apply.

"
242,242,Republicans grow some balls and start playing dirty like these liberals assholes do! URL,"This tweet contains offensive content. 
It is derisive and makes fun of the Republican party. 
  It also implies that liberals are not politically correct.

"
243,243,@USER He’s gonna tip him two new assholes,"Offensive language includes words like ""faggot,"" ""retard,"" and ""pussy.""

""Assholes"" is a derisive term for someone. 
  
  The word ""tip"" can be used to refer to a form of social punishment. This punishment can include giving someone a verbal or physical blow. In this case, it is likely that ""two new"" refers to two additional blows.

"
244,244,"""@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Yeah she loves pointing out"""" people for her rabid anti-Nazi Antifa-loving faction of supporters to, I don't know, give stern looks to? Let's be real, she either wants her minions to disrupt her """"enemies"""" by heckling or making a scene or worse.""""""","This tweet contains derisive language and slurring terms. ""Faction"" and ""minions"" are derrogatory names for groups of people, so the use of these terms is likely to be offensive to many readers. 
  
However, this is just a criticism of a person, rather then an explicit attack on an individual or group. Therefore, based on this, we do not consider this a label of offensive.

"
245,245,@USER @USER Anyone besides me think he is angling for Sessions job saw today statement made only sitting Senator would be approved as replacement otherwise Senators wouldn't stab Session in back well not sure how it makes a difference but LG may be angling then send Mueller packing,"While the statement does contain some derisive language towards the president, there is nothing that would classify it as offensive. It does express concern that the user may have an interest in replacing Jeff Sessions as the attorney general, but it is a reasonable concern based on his statements. 
  
  The statement also contains a reference to the movie Goodfellas, a popular movie that many people may find humorous. However, this is also a common reference, so it would not be classified by the model as derision. 
Overall, while the comment is derrogatory, does include offensive terms, contains deriding language about the current president of United states, is concerned about an individual's interest,  and does seem to contain a humerous reference towards a famous movie, none of these characteristics would lead the TweetPrediction model to classify this as Offensive, as it contains none off offensive words or phrases.

"
246,246,@USER @USER @USER @USER For a moment I thought you were about deaths Sounded fucked up sick at first.,"This tweet contains derisive language and slang that is commonly used by people who are not from the United States. Derisiveness is a form of hostility or aggression that can also be offensive, especially when directed at a person or group of people. 
  
  The use of slangs and derrogatory language can make the message less clear and increase the risk of misinterpretation.

"
247,247,@USER @USER Popular side doesn’t equal winning side. Facts are that private schools do a much better job educating students than public schools. Public school teachers get unfair perks that they don’t deserve. It’s unfair to private school teachers.,"This tweet contains an explicit statement of opinion, rather than a direct attack on an individual, group or topic. The statement is not derisive or negative, and it does contain some offensive terms and language. However, it also contains a clear statement that is backed up by facts, so it can be considered a reasonable opinion. 
  
  The offensive words and phrases in this tweet include: “unfair”, “private school”, and “public school”. 
   

A:
According to the Twitter API, ""unfavourable opinion"" is a ""non-political"" category.

"
248,248,...wasn't great but he is still the best I've seen...my money is on thed AB's winning both the Rugby Championships and the WC with Beauden Barrett to play a starring role. URL,"While the language used in the Tweet is offensive, there is no explicit reference to a person or group of people. In addition, although the offensive words are directed at the person who received the message, they are not targeted at a particular group. 
  
  The offensive content is not explicit, and therefore does  not violate Twitter's policy on hateful conduct.

"
249,249,.@USER does not possess the wisdom to pass judgment on a honest man like Judge Kavanaugh. She has flawed and suspect judgment as manifested in her ill-advised years long affair with the likes of Mayor Willie Brown. She launched her career on her back. She is trashy. URL,"While the content of this tweet does contain some personal opinions, they are not directed at any specific person or group. However, this does violate the Twitter Rules against attacking individuals. 
  
  The personal opinion that Judge Brett Kavanaugh is not qualified to serve on Supreme Court because he is an honest and honorable man is based on personal experience and knowledge of Judge Kavanuagh's character. This is clearly an opinion, not a fact. Therefore, while the opinion itself is offensive, Twitter does allow users to express personal views.

However, it does so in the form of a joke, which is protected speech under the First Amendment. Additionally, this is not a clear threat, as the author is clearly joking and is unlikely to take action based on this tweet.

252,252,"""@USER Eg, ANTIFA holding the position that police are racist or should be killed. Generalizations such as those are what I'd call attacking law enforcement."""" """"Attacking the cancer in the body"""" is not the same as """"attacking the body"""" even if it's systemic.""""""","""Attack the Cancer in The Body"" is a derisive term used by antifascists to describe the way that the far right portrays antifas as a monolithic group of violent, racist extremists. 
  
  ""@user Eg ANTIFA holding that position, ""generalizations"" such are ""what I’d call attack law enforcment"" are attacking the lawenforcement""

This is an example of an offensive tweet.

"
253,253,@USER @USER @USER That’s the aim Liberty WWG1WGA MAGA TheRainMakers QAnon QArmy URL,"In the first tweet the user is encouraged to remember a specific person named ""Tina"" who is not offensive. In the second tweet a user named @rainmakers is accused of being offensive, however, this accusation is based on a personal attack and is therefore offensive as well.

"
254,254,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Antifa are here telling people to go back to sleep. Horrifying,"Antifa is a left-wing activist group that has become infamous for their violent protests and use violence against right-leaning individuals and groups. Their violent tactics have been condemned by many, including the Democratic Party and many members of Congress. 
  
In the Tweet, Antifas are telling someone to ""go back sleep."" This is an offensive slur that targets the right for being concerned about the safety of their families during a time of fear and uncertainty.

"
255,255,@USER which is why im loving all this shit right now LOL,"This tweet contains explicit slur words such as ""nigger"" and ""faggot"".

A slurred word is an offensive word or phrase that is commonly used in a derisive or offensive way. Slurs are considered offensive because they are derrogatory and reinforce negative stereotypes about a group of people. 
  
  The word ""LOL"" is also considered an explicit hate word. Hate words are words that are used to attack or insult someone based solely on race or ethnicity. ""HOLY"" also falls into this category.

"
256,256,@USER And wouldn't JohnMcCain be proud... Notably @USER read a passage of Scripture at the memorial service but he was not asked to speak his own words Sen McCain likely saw him for what he is once trump took office: a gutless suck-up who's looking for Sessions job! weasel,"Offensive language includes words like 'gutless,''suck-ups,' and 'weasels.'
Personal attacks include calling someone a 'liar' or 'a gut-less sucker.' 
 Hate speech includes calling a person a derisive term like a weazel or a liar. 
 Offensive terms can also be used in an argumentative way to express disagreement. For example, calling another person's stance 'absurd' is an example of an offensive argument.

"
257,257,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER And the United States is 94th in murder rate. Thanks for proving that gun control is useless except for authoritarians.,"It is likely that the author of the above tweet disagreements with some conservative figures and does express a critical opinion of them. However, there are no offensive terms or language used in expressing the opinion. In addition, it is not clear from the text of this tweet that it was meant to offend anyone. 
  
  The use and context of certain words and phrases in this particular tweet may be considered offensive by some. For example, ""authoritarian"" is an epithet used by critics of authoritarian regimes to describe their policies. ""Murder rate"" may also be perceived as offensive to some users.

"
258,258,@USER Whoever you are you deserve this URL,"This tweet contains no offensive or abusive language. 
It is not a prediction of an event. 
 It is an expression of empathy for someone who may be experiencing a difficult situation, even if the situation is unlikely to actually be happening to that person.

"
259,259,@USER How? You can’t just say “Wrong” with no evidence for why it is. You said you agree with Sargon I’m pretty much every subject but gun control and healthcare. That’s not what a centrist believes.,"This tweet does contain some offensive terms and phrases, such as ""Worng"" and ""Sargoning"". However, it also contains information that is not derisive or personal, including the fact that Sarkozy is the former president of France. As such, this tweet can be considered as expressing a personal opinion, rather than being derrogatory or offensive.

"
260,260,@USER @USER I thought the Krebs trials couldn't say one way or the other if this was effective. So as usual @USER giving more money to their friends,"While the use and intent of the sarcasm emojis may seem negative to some, they are not considered hateful or offensive in and of themselves. 
  
  The use in the third tweet of ""friends"" instead of just ""their"" may also be interpreted as a non sequitur, and could be a reason to classify it as neutral.

"

  In addition, 'old Sore' refers to a person who is of a different political affiliation than the author, but is still considered a 'Sore'. 
    
'ConfirmKavanagh' suggests that the person is being used by the Democrats to push their political agenda.  The use derogaory terms and references to confirm sexual assault are considered offensive.

Same with antifa.""""""","Although the use and tone of the emojis in the original tweet may have contributed to its nonoffensiveness, there is also a strong argument that the content of this tweet itself is offensive and should be classified differently. 
  The use or implication of Nazi references is highly offensive, and the tone and content are highly critical. While the specific context of World War II is not mentioned, this is clearly a reference to the Nazi regime, whose violent persecution of Jews and other groups is well documented. Furthermore, although the word ""fascism"" is never used in this context, its implication is clear. Fascism is an extreme form or political ideology that is often associated with Nazism. By using this term in reference the brexiteers' negotiations, @torybunker is suggesting that those who disagree with them are attempting to force their extreme political views on others.

"
264,264,@USER @USER @USER @USER Ron DeSantis' cheesy ass MAGA commercials were cringeworthy.,"Ron De Santis is a well-known politician from the state of Florida. He is currently the governor of that state. His campaign commercials often feature him in MAGAnomics, a catchphrase he coined during his campaign. 
  
MAGAnomic is slang for ""Make America Great Again,"" a slogan used by Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election. De Santis' use of this slur in a tweet about an offensive commercial is clearly meant to offend.

"
265,265,@USER Are you and your family okay? Not sure how close you are to everything.,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
It does, however, ask a question that requires an answer. 
  The user has engaged in nonoffensiveness in their response by providing a link to a website that provides additional context and evidence to back up their claim.

"
267,267,@USER I guess Antifa will get the same treatment when they decide to loot.,"Antifa is an anti-fascist activist group. They are known for their protests and actions against far-right groups. Looting is typically associated with negative connotations, and the Antifas movement has often been associated as a criminal organization. 
  
  The user's tweet does not contain any offensive terms or slurring, but simply expresses their desire to see Antfas members get treated fairly.

  The group has a history of using violence against opponents, including members of the far-right. In some cases, members have been charged with assault. Antifascists have also been accused of engaging in vigilantism, or extrajudicial violence, against individuals they perceive to have committed acts of far right violence.

Targeting specific individuals: “a fucking” refers to an individual, specifically in reference to the player.

271,271,.@USER is her own person. She is not a @USER copycat. NVSen URL,"This tweet does express concern for the well-being of @NVSen, however it also does so in an empathic and nonoffending manner. It encourages her to seek help, acknowledges that she is struggling with this decision, encourages others to respect her decision and encourages people to give her space to decide what is best for her. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter's guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as ""the expression of a negative opinion of someone based on their race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or other characteristics without providing additional context"".
NV Sen is an American politician who has made controversial comments about women, immigrants, Muslims, LGBTQIA+ people and other groups. In this context, @nvsen is clearly expressing a personal opinion about her based upon these characteristics. 
However, in the context of this Tweet, NV Sen herself is the target of criticism, so the expression is being made in her defense. This is why the Tweeter's message does provide additional contextual information, by explaining that NV Seng is also a person and that her opinions are her personal opinions.

"
272,272,@USER Ever see when someone Is stuck in quicksand and gets the brilliant idea to reach down and pull their feet out... = ESPN,"Quicksands are not a natural phenomenon. They are created by humans. 
Pulling feet from quads is an offensive method to get out of quADS. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as ""the likelihood that a tweet will offend or disturb someone"".  The guidelines also state that ""verifying the language used in a Tweet is your responsibility"" and that if you are unsure, you should ""not post the Tweets"".
In this case, it seems that the likelihood of the message being offensive is low.  It is likely that many people would find the suggestion to pull feet (or feet and legs) from a quagmire humorous.

This is an explicit comparison of political leaders, which is considered to have a high potential for offensiveness. 
  
Additionally, although the emoticons used in the original Tweets are light hearted, they are also considered offensive by the Twitter community. In particular, @unemotivated is used to represent users who are not interested in a particular topic, but are instead just being unemotional. However, in this case, this emoticon is paired with a face that is either smiling or frowning, depending on whether the speaker is being sarcastic or not, making it even more offensive than the standard emoticons.

"
277,277,@USER you are not the true Columbia Bugle.

However, this tweet also contains a link to an article about Kamla Harris and the 2020 presidential race, so it's not just about her interview.

Everyone deserves a decent and safe place to… URL,"While the Conservatives and Labour are political parties, they are not offensive in the context of the Tweet. Both parties are committed to investing in social housing and providing more secure and affordable homes for all. 
  
Additionally, ""theresa may"" is not an offensive name. May is the current prime minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, where the United Kingdom is located.

"
280,280,@USER @USER Juan Williams just called Diamond and Silk a Minstrel Show. You know what to do!,"Diamond andSilk are a satirical news program on Comedy Central. They are not a news organization, nor are they a government agency. As such, using the term ""Minstrel show"" to describe them is not considered offensive. 
  
Juan Williams is an American journalist and former host of Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor. He has also been a guest on The Daily Show and other news programs. In response to a tweet from Diamond & Silky, he used the word ""minstrels"" in reference to them. While this word is offensive to many, it does fall into a category of slur that is often used to insult people of African descent. Because of this, Juan's use of the slang term was considered to contain offensive terms and was therefore classified in this manner.

"
281,281,@USER Liberals are kind bad slow at this or they just stalling.,"This tweet contains no offensive slur or term, but is instead a comment on how slow the liberal party is at changing its policies. 
  
  This is a non offensive tweet because it contains a compliment about how the party's members are behaving, it does contain a negative opinion about a political party, however it's not extreme or inflammatory.

"
282,282,@USER @USER @USER so she is disgusting to you because she is a Rangers fan! you are disgusting to me because you support breaking up the union! proudtobeBritish :United_Kingdom: ,"While the first tweet does express an honest opinion, calling out Jackie for being a fan of a rival team is derisive and negative towards her. 
  
  The second tweet contains derrogatory language towards the British, as well as the Union. 
Both of these factors make this tweet noncompliant with our policy on derision and negativity.

"
283,283,@USER I would affirm her. Tell her she is beautiful but at the same time that beauty comes also from wthin,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and slur, but they do not appear in the original tweet.

R. 610 was a bill in both the House and Senate that was passed and subsequently vetoed by President Trump. This bill would have amended the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to provide for the distribution of Federal funding to promote the teaching of American history in public schools. 
While the bill was ultimately veto-ed, it did pass the Senate by a vote of 57-42. However, this bill did not pass in 2017, so it was not considered by the 115 th Congress. 
  
In addition, H R 610 passed the 114 th congress with a similar vote, but was veto by president Obama.

  The use of the word ""fake"" in reference to news reports is a common slur used by social media users to express disagreement or criticism. However, in this case, we believe the term was used to convey the speaker's opinion that the reports were not credible.

"
286,286,@USER @USER @USER Antifa lives!,"Antifa is an acronym for ""anti-fascist"" which can be interpreted as an offensive term. However, it can also be a reference to an anti-government group that opposes far-right extremism. In this case, ""Antifas"" is short for the original acroynm, which means ""against fascists"". The term is used to identify and oppose far right extremists. 
  
In this tweet the user was simply stating that Antifascists live. This is neither offensive nor derrogatory.

Jon is another user who commented on Paul's tweet. 
  Jon's comment is negative and does contain offensive terms and language. However, Paul is neither the target of the comment nor is he the one using the offensive words. Paul was merely a character in the conversation who was mentioned by Jon.

288,288,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER The OG dream i believe is what you are looking for haha. If you watched all games in this tournament vs leetpro you would notice a pattern. Never the less insane game and im glad I witnessed it live.,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language. Specifically, ""OG"" is slang for ""original gamer"" which can have a derisive connotation. Additionally, leetspeak is used in the phrase ""leet pro"", which has a similar negative connotations. 
  
However, this tweet also contains a discussion of political principles and opinions, and does so in an amicable manner. For example, it is discussing a game between two teams, one of which the user supports, without attacking either team or expressing personal opinions about either side. In addition, there is nothing in either the content or tone of this Tweet that would encourage the use or sharing of explicit or graphic content, such as images or videos of violence.

Secondly, in the third tweet a user says that a beer would be a good idea. While this might seem like a harmless statement, it can also be offensive to people who do not drink alcohol. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter API, ""offense"" is not a word in their dictionary.  So, they must have used a custom dictionary to classify this as offense.

"
290,290,@USER Call bullsht just poor losser,"This tweet contains a slur, ""losser,"" which is offensive to many people and should be avoided. 
  
  The word ""bulls"" is slang for ""bisexual."" 
   
While the word is not used in the context of this particular tweet to describe a person's physical appearance, many find the slurred word offensive and derisive.

However the slurred words are not offensive in themselves, and are used in the context of a negative comment about a person. 
  
Although the comment is negative, there is no explicit reference to any specific person or group of people, so it is not directed at a specific individual. Therefore, this is considered non offensive.

"
294,294,@USER Bono ..get out of town,"This tweet does express a controversial opinion, suggesting that a well-known musician should leave the country. While this is not considered an offensive slur, this type of opinion is still not appropriate for all social media platforms.

All i heard from u was deflection &amp; excuses. Next,"@USER is an assumed username of the Twitter user who sent the original tweet
'ANTIFa' is offensive slur used to refer to people who support the Anti-Fascist movement
KKK is another offensive term used by the Ku Klux Klan to describe themselves

A:
According to this article, ""Offensive Language"" is defined as: ""Language that denigrates or degrades groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, disability, age, and/or sexual orientation.""
In your example, @user mentioned antifa, a group that is against the antifascists, also known as anti-fascism.  Antifa is considered offensive by many. 
""Offensiveness"" in this case is based off of context. @User mentioned that antifas are considered a hate group by antifat, antifag, etc. This is context that many consider offensive.

"
296,296,@USER @USER It’s never been about that!!Everything about Color :face_with_raised_eyebrow: If public safety was a concern there would be MORE GUN CONTROL e.g Assault Rifles :face_without_mouth: ,"While the word ""more"" is a word that can be used in many ways, in this case it is being used as an adjective to describe something that is more or less. In this context, ""gun control"" can mean limiting access to firearms, limiting the number of types of firearms that are available, requiring a permit to purchase or own a firearm, etc. Therefore, this tweet could be interpreted as a call for more gun control, but it could also be seen as simply stating a fact that more and more people are being killed by guns.

"
297,297,@USER A thought I had watching this “does she know where she is or what’s going on?”,"This tweet does not contain any content that is offensive or derisive. 
  The use and description of emojis such as the thumbs up and claps 
   are intended to be humorous and lighthearted. 
Gun control is an important issue that many people across the political 
    spectrum support. This tweet by @TylerMcVicker does 
     not contain derision or criticism of any person or 
      group.

"
298,298,@USER We must all stick together to MAGA,"While the use and tone of the word ""stinky"" is offensive, there is nothing offensive in this tweet itself. 
  
  The use or nickname ""pride"" in combination with the emoji of a heart with a ribbon is affectionate and positive. 
There is also no derrogatory or insulting content or language in ""URL"". 
 The use ""DOJ"" without any context is not helpful and does nothing to explain the point the author is trying to make.

"
299,299,@USER @USER @USER . Hypocrisy to see so called conservatives call out supposed sexual deviancy when just about every sexual political scandal in recent memory involves Republicans and it's really homophobia RoyMoore Kavanaugh JimJordan MarkFoley BobPackwood ClarenceThomas DonaldTrump,"While the first half of this tweet does express a critical opinion, it also contains offensive slang and language that could be interpreted as derisive. For example, ""hypocrite"" is a derision used to describe someone who pretends to be something they are not. 
  
In addition, this is not the only time that conservatives have called out alleged sexual impropriety by Republicans. In fact, Roy Moore, Brett Kavanaugh, Jim Jordan, Mark Foley, Bob Packwood, Clarences Thomas, Donald Trump, and Mike Huckabee all faced allegations of sexual misconduct. 
Furthermore, while the second half does contain a criticism of liberals, there is also a clear implication that the conservatives are the ones engaging in sexual behavior that is inappropriate.

"
301,301,@USER You are battling with what you feel,"This tweet does contain slur words, but they are used metaphorical, rather than being used directly. 
It does express an offensive opinion, however, it is based off of a personal experience, which is why the model classified it as offensive.

"
302,302,@USER the double life of veronique,"It does contain personal attack language, such as ""liar"", ""cunt"", and ""stupid"". However, it is not directed at any particular individual, nor does it contain derisive terms or slang that would be considered offensive. The language is used to describe the person's character, rather that their identity. 
  
While the Tweet does discuss the past allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, there is no offensive content in the statement itself. Rather, most of the content is focused around the subject of gun controls and the debate around that topic.

"
303,303,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER I'm sure most patients would prefer to be treated in a professional and transparent manner by the NHS rather than being packed off to some carpet bagging health company hoping to squeeze a shareholder dividend out of an essential public service monopoly.,"This tweet does not contain any explicit language that would be considered offensive. However, it does contain language which could be perceived as derisive or condescending, and the use of ""carpet bag"" could also be seen as offensive, as it implies that the service being referred to is of low quality. 
  
  Overall, this tweet contains a mix of positive, neutral, negative and offensive content, making it difficult to predict the label for this Tweet.

"
304,304,@USER Gawd help us.,"This tweet contained strong language, including offensive terms such as ""cunt"" (derogatory for a woman) and ""fuck"" (""to have sexual intercourse""). However the language is used in the context of a debate or discussion, rather that being directed at the user. 
  
Although the tone of the Tweet is negative, there is no explicit personal attack or offensive slur.

"
305,305,@USER Put your stance on gun control on your website.,"This tweet contains no explicit language that is offensive or targets any individuals or groups in an offensive manner. 
  The user agrees with the statement that ""Republicans shot down gun controls in Obama terms"" and supports Trump because ""he's going to be there 6 years more."" 
   The statement is factually correct and presents an argument for gun restrictions.

"
306,306,@USER Maybe there wouldn't be 5 of these things a day of there was a little sensible gun control in this fucking country.,"While the first tweet may appear to contain a humorous reference to the US President, there is clearly an element of offense in the statement ""5 ofthese things  a day"" which could be interpreted as a derisive reference. 
  

A:
According to this tweet by the Twitter Trust and Safety team, they classify a tweet as non offensive if it contains ""language or content that is potentially offensive to some groups, but does NOT contain explicit threats of violence or other explicit indications of hate.""
So, in summary, your tweet is considered non offensve because it contained language and content which was potentially off-putting to certain groups but did not include explicit indicators of hatred.

"
307,307,@USER And the media will simply not calm down and just report normally and let the folks decide. They are a propaganda arm of one party and anyone who disagrees with their doctrine is dismissed as evil and worthy of the Auntie Maxine or ANTIFA treatment or worse.,"This tweet contains a reference to an Aunt Jemima, a popular breakfast food. Aunti Jemi is a character in a children's book series about a black family living in rural Georgia. She is known for her love of sweets and her tendency to over-indulge. 
  
While the reference is not derisive, it does contain a slur and could be considered offensive to some.

"
308,308,@USER @USER speaks in nothing but dog whistles. Who does she think she is fooling?,"Offensive language includes explicit words or phrases such as ""fuck,"" ""shit,"" or ""ass.""
Slurs are derisive words used to insult someone's race or ethnicity. 
  
  Slurring words are words that are considered derrogatory but are not meant to be offensive, such a ""dumb"" or a person who is ""too fat."" 
   
Derogative words refer to words and phrases that describe someone in a way that is negative, but not necessarily offensive or hateful. For example, a slur for someone of a different race is a racist slang word, not an offensive racial epithet.

"
309,309,@USER He is going to win!,"While the use of slang and colloquialisms is typical in social media, this tweet contains offensive terms and phrases, such as ""sociopath,"" ""malicious narcissism,"" and ""win."" The use and meaning of these terms is subjective and depends on context, but in this case, they are likely referring specifically to the Antifasim movement and its leaders. 
  
Offensive terms can be offensive regardless of context. For example, ""nigger"" is offensive in all contexts, regardless if it is used to refer to a race of people, a person of a certain race or used as an exclamation. Similarly, terms like ""faggot"" and similar slurring terms are offensive to many regardless their context and usage.

"
310,310,@USER You’re a bye week,"This tweet contains no offensive words, slur words or terms that are derrogatory to a particular race or gender. 
It is an expression of gratitude to the party that nominated the candidate.

312,312,@USER @USER Then there should be no problem having Kavanaugh take a lie detector test just as Dr. Ford. If he is so anxious to clear his name he should be asking to take a lie detector test. The fact that @USER isn't blasting tweets on this issue also speaks volumes!,"@USER is an account that has tweeted over 1,000 times and has a high number of followers. 
In the Tweet, @USERNOMICIDE mentioned the account @TREVORNO, who is also a user on Twitter. @TRENDING is another account with over a million followers that frequently tweets about politics. 
  The TWEET mentions the hypothetical reaction of the ""left"" if Kavanaugh had taken a polygraph test during his confirmation process. This hypothetical scenario is not derisive or intended to be offensive, but rather a discussion of a possible reaction from the political left.

Thanks free speech antifa.,"Kelly Clarity's song ""Breakaway"" contains lyrics that many find offensive. For example, one line is ""I'm a target of the NRA, I'm not afraid to say it"". 
  
  The user in question, @user, has tweeted several times about the song and its lyrics. 
   
@USER: ""@USER Kelly's voice is so annoying. I can't stand her music. She's the worst.""
   @user: ""Victoria is a beautiful person. Her name is Victoria. @NRA is an organization that protects people's right to bear arms. They don't want you to speak out against them. You should be afraid of them."" 
 @USERTWEET: @KELLY_CLARKSON ""BREAKAWAY"" is about a woman who leaves her abusive relationship and becomes a successful singer. One line in the chorus is: I am a breakaway, you never could have been my lover. Some people find the line offensive because it implies that the woman in that song is like the singer Kelly Clarkson.

"
316,316,@USER @USER Gun safety reform? What exactly does that mean? Do you mean gun control?,"Gun safety is an important issue that affects all of us. The user was simply asking for clarification on what gun safety reforms mean. This is not an offensive statement, but rather a matter of public interest. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter API, ""faceWithTearsOfJoy"" is the emoticons for ""happy"".
So, in conclusion, Twitter is right, you are an Oxymorian.

317,317,.@USER Veterans earned their benefits. How can the Liberals justify failing to spend this money on those who need it most? cdnpoli URL,"This tweet does mention a group of people, namely veterans, and the fact that they earned benefits through the government. However, it does so in a non derrogatory manner, stating that veterans earned the benefits they received through government programs. 
  
Additionally, this tweet was not written by a liberal, as the author is clearly a republican.

Sod chequers :hear-no-evil_monkey: :smiling_face_with_halo: :star: :rainbow: :star: URL,"In the original tweet the user referred to Theresa may as ""AnnetTE Johnson"", a slur for African Americans. 
An offensive term for a woman is ""annettee"". 
  
  The term ""chequERS"" is a reference to a British military base in Belgium. 
   
""Sod"" can be a derisive term used to describe someone who is slow or clumsy.  It is not a positive term.

"
319,319,@USER Omg Jin’s laugh makes me wanna laugh my whole life. He is so adorable,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
It does, however, express an unpopular opinion. 
  The opinion is based on facts and is a reasonable reaction to the content of the original tweet.  
  It is also not clear that the opinion was intended to be humorous.

"
320,320,@USER Nope. I won’t trade him he is to much fun. Plus we can’t spell HOPE without him,"While the Tweet does contain offensive statements (such as ""he is too much of a fun guy""), it also contains positive statements about Trump (e.g., ""Nope""). Therefore the classification of this tweet as offensive is not applicable. 
  
  The Tweeter in this example is a conservative who supports Trump. They are not offended by the content of their TWEET.

"
321,321,@USER Aj nahin to kal tum ko bi marna hy you are bad thinking,"While the word ""nigger"" is used in a derisive manner, there is not enough context to determine whether it is being used as an offensive slur or a term of endearment. 
  
  Similarly, while the phrase ""bitch"" might not be used by the author in an overtly offensive manner (based on its use in other contexts), it could be perceived as offensive by some users.

"
322,322,@USER @USER @USER I will never forget what levels you racist liberals went to and what you did to Clarence Thomas. Liberals are the worst people ever.,"Offensive language and/or insults were used in this tweet. 
This tweet expresses an extreme opinion that is not supported by the evidence. 
  For example, it suggests the users of the Twitter account are so extreme that they would go to levels of racism and other atrocities that the actual history of liberals and conservatives has to offer.

"
323,323,@USER @USER He won’t! He’ll do just like Mitch McConnell and never mention the good that @USER has accomplished.,"@USER's tweet congratulates the user for accomplishing something positive. 
  The use a clap emojis with light skintone further emphasize the
  congratulations. 
There is nothing offensive in this tweet and the use and tone of
   the claps emoticons is appropriate.

"
324,324,@USER Can we please now be honest with ourselves and acknowledge this trans stuff is a mental disorder? And NOT normal human behavior?,"While the term ""transgender"" is not used in the original tweet and the context is purely personal opinion, there is still a strong negative sentiment towards the subject of transgenderism. 
  
  The term transgender is slang for someone who is ""transexual"", which means they are ""switching genders"". This is an identity that many people find to be deeply troubling, as it implies that someone's gender is merely a choice. This can lead to feelings of guilt and shame, and can cause significant distress and impairment in mental health. 
This is especially true for young people, who may not fully understand the science behind gender identity, leading to even more distress. In addition, many trans people experience discrimination and harassment, including from the medical community, their families, friends, coworkers, etc. These experiences can be traumatizing and lead many to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harm, suicide, among other mental illnesses.

"
325,325,@USER Go eat some more burgers :hamburger: butthead!,"This tweet is not offensive. Although the word 'butthead' is considered derisive, its use in this context is meant to be humorous. 
  
  The model did not detect any negative sentiments towards religious groups.

"
326,326,@USER I'M SO FUCKING READY,"While the sentiment of the Tweet is positive, there is a clear negative tone towards a specific person. This is an offensive slur towards that person, and the use of slang and profanity is not acceptable in all contexts, even if the intent is to be humorous. 
  
  The use or threat of violence is present in the sentence ""I'm so fucking ready."" This type of language is considered to have a negative impact on society and is therefore classified an Offensive Tweets.

"
327,327,@USER @USER According to the liberals yes! Guilty unless she proves her innocence! Wait are you a man? If so then No you can not be trusted ever! How dare you make a claim against a woman! Women are above the sins of man! We are perfect!,"This tweet contains a slur against women, ""guilty"". While this is an offensive slang term, slurred words are not uncommon in speech and are generally not considered offensive. 
While the rest of the message is about gun laws, this part of it is clearly an ad-homineme attack on E-cigarette users, who are often financially dependent on an e-cigs industry that E minem is part owner of. 
  

A:
According to Urban Dictionary, a ""Guilty"" slime is ""a sloppy, unkempt, or unclean person or thing"".  This is the slant of this slung at women.  It is offensive because it implies that women are slobs and should be ashamed of themselves.

"
328,328,@USER @USER @USER @USER Pressure from other liberals may make him change his mind. Their goal is the end result. They don’t care what it takes to get there.,"This tweet contains a reference to a political debate from a few years ago. In that debate, one of the candidates made a controversial statement that was later found to be false. This tweet's author is expressing their opinion that the pressure from the left may have an impact on another candidate's decision-making process, but does it contain offensive terms or slurring that would make it non‑offensiveness? No. While the statement made by the candidate in the debate may not be true, this tweet doesn't contain personal insults or offensive slang. Therefore, we classify this as a nonoffending tweet.

"
329,329,@USER He's still around?,"This tweet contains no offensive slur or derisive term. 
It does, however, contain a strong insult. 
  The user is suggesting that John F. Kerry, who is a former United States Secretary of State, is still alive. This insult is not considered offensive.

"
330,330,@USER I suppose you think the way liberals attacked Sarah Palin was courageous also. You’re just another hypocrite.,"@USER is an account that is likely operated by Twitter. Twitter has guidelines against abusive behavior, and the use of the word 'courageous' in this context is considered to have a negative connotation. 
  
  @user is another Twitter account, but it is possible that the person who posted this comment is also a Twitter user. In this case, it would be inappropriate to disclose their account name in a response.

"
331,331,@USER ALL LIVES MATTER!!!!,"This tweet does contain derrogatory words, but they are used in a humorous manner and are not meant to be taken seriously. The user is stating their opinion that all lives matter, which is an important and valid point to make. 
  
However, their use of derogyatory slur words is offensive and should not be used. ""Nigger"" is a derogaatory word that is not used lightly. While it is used as a slang word in many parts of America, it carries a history of being a racial slURM and carries with it a negative connotation. Using this word is inappropriate and offensive.

  The quote is used to criticize the conservative view that the Constitution is unenforceable and should not be taken seriously.

333,333,@USER Right on :thumbs_up: :thumbs_up: MAGA :United_States: :folded_hands: :United_States: WWG1WGA :United_States: :oncoming_fist: :United_States: ,"This tweet contains no offensive slur or term, although it does contain the word ""faggot.""

While the term ""gay"" is offensive to many people, it should not be considered derisive or hateful in and of itself. It is often used in an offensive manner, as in ""that gay movie was terrible."" The word is also often a slang term for ""gayer"" or ""gasper,"" which can also be offensive. 
  
In this case, ""MAGA"" stands for Make America Gay Again, which is an acronym for ""[my] America Gone Abnormal."" This phrase is used by some members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a Mormon church, to refer to their belief that the United States is no longer a Christian nation. Members of this church often use the phrase to express pride in how the country has become more LGBTQ+ friendly. However, this phrase can have a deriding or pejorative connotation among those with a negative view of Mormons, who often perceive them as intolerant and bigoted. Therefore, while ""Make America gay again"" may be a tongue-in-cheek phrase, its use in this context is still offensive and should be avoided.


Although the use and meaning of "" MAGa "" is considered offensive, there is nothing derrogatory or negative about it. In fact, many members and supporters of that church use it in that way. So, I would classify this tweet as not being offensive

334,334,@USER @USER When your bio is the most relevant piece of shit ever :thinking_face: :eyes: ,"While the content of the Tweet is critical of a person's bio, there is an explicit reference to race. Specifically, ""when yourbio isthe mostrelevant pieceof shit evar :eye: "" is slang for "" when your skin is black"". This type of racial slur is considered offensive and has a negative impact on a Tweeter's online presence. 
  

If you would like to update your Twitter bio to improve your chances of avoiding a classification, you can do this by following these steps:
1. Go to your profile page and click on Edit Bio. 
2. Add a new line to the bio that explains why you changed your Bio and what you are doing to address the issue.

However, there is a negative tone to the sentiment expressed, with the word ""lying"" being used to describe the character's opinion. 
  The use and context of the @ symbol might also be interpreted as sarcasm.

336,336,@USER Eric Holder should be tried for treason EricHolderCrimes#,"Eric Holder is a former US Attorney General and former President Barack Obama's second-longest serving cabinet member. He is also a Democrat. 
  
Holder was charged with various crimes, including perjury, obstruction of justice, false statements, bribery, conspiracy, money laundering, racketeering, destruction of evidence, making false declarations, witness intimidation, misusing a firearm, carrying a weapon in public, possession of a controlled substance, theft of government property, lying to the FBI, falsifying business records,  and making a false statement. The charges stemmed from his involvement in Operation Fast and Furious, a federal gun-trafficking investigation that allowed thousands of guns to flow to Mexican drug cartels.

"
337,337,@USER @USER @USER Omg what country were you in?? It wasn’t America. But again you liberals will believe ANYTHING,"This tweet contains a slur, but it does so in a derisive way. While the slurred word is offensive, it's not derrogatory or intended to insult the person who replied to it. 
It's also important to note that this is not a political tweet. Rather, this user is just expressing their opinion. 
"

"
340,340,@USER @USER Very disturbed by how this platform has become like a dictatorship from the Soviet state.,"There is a lack of negative or offensive content. 
While the content is negative, it is also appreciating the negative behavior of other users. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter's guidelines, offensive and abusive language is not allowed. So, in this case, @user's tweet violates the guidelines.

Wade was not overturned.,"This tweet does mention an actual individual, but it also expresses an unpopular opinion. Some people might find the individual's name and accusations against him or her offensive. However, this tweet contains no explicit language that is offensive, nor does it target an individuals based on their name or accusations alone.

"
342,342,@USER It’d better be on Monday and who the hell are they to slow walk this and dictate terms? MAGA,"While the first tweet contains no explicit slur or offensive content, its tone and content are clearly sarcasm-based and could be interpreted as derogatory towards women. 
  
  The second tweet also contains offensive words and slang, but the context makes it clear that the words are being used in jest.  It is an expression of frustration at a slow pace of walking, and the use the phrase ""slow walk"" to describe a process is common slanguage. However, in this context, ""dictate terms"" could also be seen as a derisive reference to the MAGa movement, a right-wing political movement that supports President Trump.

"
343,343,@USER Damn I felt this shit. Why you so loud lol,"Offensive language: 'damn' and 'lol' are offensive words. 
  Personal attacks: the use of 'you' to refer to both the person making the comment as well as the one receiving it.  
  Negative connotation: referring to a group of people as 'violent Anti-Fa' is derisive and negative.

"
344,344,@USER you are a traitor URL,"URL is an acronym for ""Uniform Resource Locator"" which refers to a web address, such as https://www.google.com/. The acrostic URL is made up of letters of a person's name, separated by periods, with the last letter being the s in ""Traitor"". The word traitor is generally considered to have negative connotations, so the acrostics is interpreted to mean that the author is someone who has betrayed their country, their friends, etc.

Fewer lives n minds can't be changed.,"Although the word ""beef"" is derogatory, there is not any explicit slur or offensive term used in it. 
  
  The word “Osama” is a reference to the former leader of Al-Qaeda, and the phrase “Janaza” means prayer in Urdu. Therefore, using this phrase in a derisive context is acceptable.

Rosie is the name of the main character in the movie ""The Notebook."" Levi is her love interest. Jack is another character from the same movie. The quote is an example of how the character Rosie might express her opinion. 
  
  The quote does contain offensive words and phrases, but it also contains positive words like ""liberals"" and ""dangerous."" The positive language is what makes the quote non offensive.

It is just expressing a negative view about the subject of the conversation.

349,349,@USER Oh no is he going to start painting hideous pictures like @USER and peddle socialism and gun control for everyone but himself. @USER,"This tweet does contain a derisive term for a group of people, but it's not directed at any one person in particular. Additionally, it doesn't contain offensive words or phrases. 
  
  The employee in question is described as being ""strange"" in many ways, including being a ""phobe of all things dog."" This is not a personal attack on that individual, as it could be applied to many people.  It's also not an opinion or viewpoint that is offensive.

"
350,350,@USER @USER @USER We are calling you an operative . Or Shill. And more important a bigot for refusing to apologize for your actions to a woman just because she IS NOT a Scientologist. You won’t even acknowledge what you did or defend or explain it despite how many times it has been asked already?,"@USER is the username of an account that was created to reply to this specific tweet. 
This tweet contains profane language, including the word ""fucken."" 

 

In addition, this is an offensive tweet in that it targets a specific person, @TREVORNO, and makes derisive comments about him. 
  

While the rest of this reply is mostly supportive of @USER's point, it also contains a number of deriding comments that are not supportive:
- ""Indie"": This is derision, as @INDIE is clearly a derided term used by @User to describe the place that @TRevORno is working towards. This deride is also not complimentary, since @IndIE does NOT describe @trorno as being talented or hard-working. In fact, he is described as ""a little bit of everything,"" which does little to inspire confidence in him as an individual.

  - ""@USER: log doesn’ t give  a shit  i bet  he eats  nachos  in the  middle of  the night  In his  underwear"":  This is another derider, because ""log"" is used as deridical slang for ""laugh,"" and @LOG doesn t know that ""i"" means ""I"" in slangspeak.  @LOG does, however, know how to eat nacho cheese in bed, so this derides him too. @user is right that this does sound like a threat, though it's not clear what the threat is. Perhaps @log doesn 't know where @trevorno lives, in which case he should look up the address. Or perhaps he does know,  and he's threatening to beat up @trevornob because he doesn' t like him, either because @Log doesn  t like Scientology or because of some other reason. Either way, derailing a conversation with a personal attack is offensive, regardless of whether the attack was justified. 

  The offensive nature of these comments is further evidenced by the fact that they are made in response  to a request for @userto apologize to @TrORvoR for his actions. If @usr had not made these derisions, there would be no context for the request, no reason for  him to make derident comments, nor would he have been obligated to respond. Thus, these are deriders made to derail a discussion, not to support it. They are also deridents because they make negative comments and insults about @Trevornob, a person targeted in this particular tweet and not a third party. Finally, they deridge @indiele because  this is clear derISION of him and does nothing to show that he deserves deridation.

 
  Thus, while the other parts of his reply are mostly positive, his derigration of another person in an attempt to divert the conversation from the topic at hand is what makes this offensive and derids him in doing so. He should apologize.

  laws, but does comply with the law against murder. While the reference is
unpleasant, it does contain no explicit derision, offensive terms or
offensiveness that would be classified in a different category. 
  The reference can also be seen as a humorous comment about the
inability of law to compel compliance. In this case, there is no
harassment, intimidation, threat, coercion, bribery, blackmail or other 
    impermissible behavior.

The second statement is an explicit call for the assassination of a public official. 
  
  While it may be a tongue-in-cheek statement, ""YEA YEP Jeff SHOULD GO"" is still an offensive statement. ""Jeff"" could be any public figure, and the call to assassinate them is meant to intimidate and instill fear in their supporters.

355,355,@USER well do some research and dairy and gluten allergies are major problems with mental health from anxiety and depression to bi polar and schizophrenia.. Its a tough diet but if you are sick of feeling like you are its way worth it,"This tweet does mention a food allergy, however, there is not enough information to determine whether the allergy is to dairy or gluten. If the food is dairy, then the person who has the dairy allergy may experience severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, an extreme allergic reaction that can lead to death. This is considered a serious allergy and can be life-threatening. On the other hand, if the allergen is gluten, a person with celiac disease must avoid eating anything containing gluten in order to avoid an immune reaction. Celiacs must be careful to only avoid gluten from products, as not all products labeled gluten-free are actually safe for celsiacs. In addition, colds and flus can cause damage to the small intestine, leading to malabsorption of nutrients and an increased risk of nutrient deficiencies. 
  
In addition to these serious health risks, many people with food allergies experience emotional distress, such as anxiety, depression, bi-polar disorder, schizophrenia, etc. These are all mental illnesses that are also highly stigmatized, so many individuals with these illnesses may be reluctant to seek treatment or may avoid treatment altogether. Some people may also experience these mental disorders without any known food triggers, yet still experience symptoms. For example, some people experience anxiety or depression without knowing whether their anxiety is caused by a specific event or by their general personality. Similarly, people who experience bipolar or schizophrenia may have no known triggers for their symptoms, although they may believe that their environment or upbringing is the cause.


Overall, this is an example of problematic language that may cause offense to some readers. While the language is potentially offensive, its not clear that the tweets content is offensive. Therefore, we classify this as a non offensive tweet. Please note that this classification is based on a single tweet and we encourage you to report offensive tweets to us at [email protected]

  The language in this Tweet is ambiguous and could be interpreted in multiple ways. For example, ""deadnames"" could refer to a person's former name, or it could mean names that are no longer used. Additionally, while the word ""treasure"" may sound like a derisive term, this word could also be used as a playful term.

It uses the word ""MAGA"" which has become a slang term for ""Make America Great Again"" in recent years. This is not considered offensive. 
  
However, there is a use for emojis in tweets, so the use is still considered potentially offensive: the emoticons used in that tweet are considered to be offensive by some.

This is a clear indication that the slurs are not used in other contexts and are likely offensive. 
There is also a strong implication that @user does not know what a conservative is. 
  This is likely because @use is an account that supports the current president of United states.

"
371,371,@USER Was there any specific comment that brought up this point recently? And yes you are speakin da troof,"While the language in the Tweet is speculative, there is no explicit derisive or disrespecting language and the overall sentiment is positive.

372,372,@USER I always have Eddie pick flowers out for me and tell the cashier that he is getting them for me. LOL,"This tweet contains a nonoffending reference to Eddie, a character from the TV show ""Friends.""

While the reference is not offensive, it does contain a slang term that is commonly used among young people to refer to drugs. 
  
  The reference does appear to contain an implicit attack against a person or persons, as the person referenced is identified as ""Eddie"" and is generally referred to as by a different name in the rest of this tweet.

"

Ivanka is one of his children. She is neither ignorant nor clod-hopper.  She is well-informed and will turn on her parents to protect herself. The author of this tweet seems not to know this. 
Flip is slang for ""flipped"". It can also mean ""to change sides"". The word is used in the context of politics to describe someone who changes their opinion on an issue. In this context it could mean that Ivank would flip and turn against her father to help herself, which is an offensive slur.

"
375,375,@USER @USER @USER @USER Don't you liberals want to lower the voting age to 16,"This tweet contains a strong negative sentiment towards a group of people, and the sentiment is not explicit or offensive in nature. 
Although the underlying sentiment may be negative, there is no explicit slur or other offensive term used to express the negative sentiments.

"
376,376,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Amazing how they can consistently manage to piss off both progressives and conservatives by being so arrogantly misguided--often in same segments.,"While the use of the word ""they"" in the last sentence is subjective, its use in that context is critical. ""They"" is used to refer to both conservatives and progressivists, who are often grouped together in political discussions. In that sentence, ""both progressivism and conservatism"" are grouped in an arrogant manner, as if they are the same thing. This is an offensive way to discuss groups of people, because it implies that they have the exact same values and beliefs.

"
377,377,@USER It’s in my fuckbucket,"Offensive language includes words like 'fuck','shit', and 'cunt'.

Derogative terms include words that describe someone as'stupid', or 'dumb'. 
  
Negative sentiment includes statements that express dislike or aversion for something. 
   
While the rest of the message is positive, it contains offensive content and should be removed.

"
378,378,@USER Ahhh the left wing liberal Democrats.,"While the Tweet contains derisive remarks about various groups or organizations, such remarks are not explicit or explicit slurring terms targeting individuals based their protected characteristic. 
  
  The Tweeter is expressing an opinion, which is not an offensive remark.

379,379,"""@USER And that's when you say: Well I wanted to take care of you, but if you're going to make that impossible, I guess you are on your own.

While the term ""on your [own]"" is offensive, it's not used in this context. 
  The rest of this tweet contains no derrogatory words, and the author is not making personal attack against the character referenced in ""that."" 
 The author's point is that they wanted take responsibility for their actions, even if the other person would not allow it. This is an argument for taking responsibility, a topic that is generally considered to be nonoffensve.

"
380,380,@USER @USER @USER got him signing my book......he is a cute URL,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language. ""Cute URL"" is derisive and condescending towards someone for their professional accomplishments. 
While the user may be expressing positive sentiments towards the individual mentioned in the Tweet, there is also a negative tone to their comments, indicating that this is an offensive conversation.

"
381,381,@USER @USER I mean he is worth it,"In this example, @user is expressing an unpopular opinion, but the opinion is not based on offensive slurring or terms, nor does it express any intent to harm the person expressing the unpopular opinions. Therefore, it is classified a non offensive tweet.

"
382,382,@USER Soros' people are really vicious and out of control. He or one of his allies probably plans and funds Antifa. They are actually trying to take over the government.,"There is nothing offensive in this tweet. Eliminating all offensive terms would require a separate answer, as this is an expression of an individual's opinion. 
While the use ""Soros"" may be considered offensive, it is not the only offensive term used in that tweet and is therefore not sufficient to classify the entire tweet as offensive. 
"
383,383,.@USER laughs at conservatives on The View for suddenly being outraged by his support of Democrats -- come on guys - clearly they weren't THAT good of fans if they didn't know who he was. URL,"While the phrase ""@USER Laughs at Conservatives on 'The View' for Suddenly Being Outraged By His Support of Dems"" is not offensive, it is a crude way of criticizing the person. 
  
  The URL provided in the Tweet is no longer valid.

"
384,384,@USER Anti abortion is not about the sanctity of life. Its about the subjugation of women. If it was about life then the paradox you point out would not exist and gun control would be pursued.,"In the above example, @user is expressing a personal opinion about a topic that is of personal interest to them. This is an example of non offensive political discourse. 
  
  In contrast, if @User were expressing something that was directed at another person or a group of people, then it would likely be offensive.

"
385,385,After all the shit Dez was talking about Jerry and The cowboys he is a fucking clown ass dude if he go back,"Dez is an offensive term to describe Jerry. 
  Jerry is Jerry, so calling someone by a nickname to refer to them by their full name is not offensive, however Jerry is also a person, and Jerry's name can be used to insult people. Jerry used the term ""DeZ"" to call someone else ""dez"", which is offensive because dez refers to someone as a derisive nickname.

"
386,386,5:26 you are my late night thoughts.,"This tweet does contain a slur, but it's not offensive. ""Late night"" is slang for ""late at night"".

387,387,@USER What happened to Flash? I hope he is healthy,"Flash is the name of a fictional character from the TV show 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'. The character was created by Joss Whedon, and is portrayed by David Boreanaz. 
  
  Flash was introduced in the show's fifth season, in ""Bewitched, But Married"", and remained a main character until the end of the seventh season. He is an extremely powerful and agile vampire who is also a skilled martial artist. Flash is often portrayed as being arrogant and egotistical, although he has a deep and abiding love for Buffy and her friends.

  The term 'Flash' is commonly used as a slang term for 'dick'. Although it can also be used to refer to a powerful weapon, this is unlikely to have been the intended meaning in this instance. 'Flasher' may also have come into play, referring to someone who flashes a car's lights to attract attention. However, 'flashers' are usually male, so this term is less likely to apply to the character in question. Finally, while 'flash' can refer specifically to an electric shock, there is no evidence that this was the meaning intended in relation to this character. In summary, based on this evidence, we can conclude that the term was not intended to convey an offensive meaning. Therefore, even though the word'Flash'was used in a negative way in that tweet (i.e. as an insult), it was still not offensive and therefore does fall into the non offensive category. 
Thank you for your help!

388,388,@USER @USER @USER @USER He is building it.,"This tweet does contain strong offensive terms, but the context makes it clear that the term is being used in a pejorative sense. For example, ""bitch"" is used to refer to an ex-girlfriend, and ""honey"" can refer generically to someone who is attractive or appealing. 
  
However, in this context, @user is clearly being referred to as a woman, so the offensive term ""bitches"" would not be used peremptorily to insult a man. In addition, although the word ""sucking"" might have a negative connotation, there is no evidence that it is meant to have an offensive meaning here.

"
389,389,@USER @USER I banned him personally a long time ago. But it isn’t breaking the law when I do it.,"This tweet contains no explicit or implicit offensive terms.

"
390,390,@USER Sure thing :smirking_face: ,"In this case, ""smiling_ face"" is an offensive slur. Offensive slang is considered to have a negative connotation and is generally not considered appropriate for social media. 
  
  The slurred word is used in the context of a joke, and it's unclear whether the author is being serious or not. If the former, then the slashed word may be interpreted as a serious threat.

Finally, although the Pope is mentioned, his name is never used in the context of any person or group. Therefore, this is classified a non offensive tweet.

"
394,394,@USER Yeah we need some more made up bullshit protestors and antifa lol time for an epic beatdown :winking_face: ,"In the first tweet the word ""arm"" is used as a verb, so the prediction label should be ""offense"". The use or verb ""to arm"" can be considered offensive because it implies that the individual is preparing to use a weapon against another individual. 
  

""Arming"" another person or entity implies the intent to cause harm. For example, ""armed robbery"" implies an intent of theft. ""Armed forces"" imply an intention to wage war. 
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/arm
  ""armed"" [with object]
1: having or showing weapons or weapons-like equipment: ARMED ARMY
2: prepared to fight: THE ARMORY
3: willing to take risks: TO ARM ONE'S BLOG
4: capable of defending or protecting: ARMED FORCES
5: ready to engage in a debate: THEY ARM THE OTHERS
6: eager to try something new: SHE ARMORED HERSELF WITH SELF-DEFENSE
7: able to influence or persuade: AN ARMOURED BATTLE
8: equipped with weapons: HE ARMOUSLY ARROWS HIS CHAIR
9: furnished with arms: A MILLION ARMSTRONGS
10: provided with firearms: WE ARM OURSELVES WITH SCIENCE
11: armed with knowledge: HIS ARMCHAIR CONFERS POWER
12: fully armed: FULL ARMING THE TROOPS
13: well armed (with weapons): THE ARMS RACE IS STRONG
14: completely armed
15: thoroughly armed

  In this context, to ""train"" someone to carry a gun is to prepare them to do so. This implies a willingness to put others in harm's way. To ""unarm"", or to remove someone from being armed, implies they are no longer prepared for that use. In this case, a person who has ""trained"" themselves out of being able or prepared is ""untrained"". This is an offensive term.


A ""gun"" in this instance is a dangerous instrument that can cause great harm to others. Therefore, using the term ""training"" to refer to the process of removing a firearm from a potentially dangerous individual implies this is something that could cause grave harm and is not something to which one should subject oneself lightly. Training someone in how to handle a deadly weapon implies one is willing and able, at any time, without warning, consider themselves capable or willing, in any way, shape or form, of using that weapon to harm another. Thus, when someone says ""I trained myself out"" of carrying a ""Gun"", they imply they no long have the intention or ability to commit any crime with a Gun, but rather they have trained themselves to not need or desire one. When someone ""Unarms"" a criminal, they remove them from the possession of a law enforcement agency, who is obligated to ensure the criminal does no harm with their Gun. Removing a GUN from someone who was previously armed implies there is now no threat of harm, only the possibility of great joy. Unarming a Criminal implies it would be a good idea to invite them over for dinner. However, if a Law Enforcement officer attempts to unarm a violent criminal they will be met with force, as they were trained to expect and handle such situations. If a Police officer is unable to overcome the threat posed by a armed criminal with lethal force they should not attempt to disarm the Criminal, because they did not train themselves in such a way that they could. Rather, that criminal should face the appropriate legal consequences for their actions. By implication, attempting to train oneself out from carrying or using a lethal weapon is akin to attempting suicide. Such a drastic action should only be undertaken by someone with no regard for the consequences. Attempting to Unarm oneself from Guns is analogous to trying to swim upstream. Swimming upstream implies attempting something difficult or dangerous, yet also exhilarating. One should never attempt swimming upstream unless they possess the strength and stamina to endure the ordeal. Similarly, one cannot unArm oneself, for it requires the same strength to destroy a threat as it to prevent one, therefore attempting this feat is also akin attempting self-destruction. Finally, unarming oneself implies not only is one not prepared or able for violence, however, also one does so with reckless disregard for one's own safety. That is, someone unarmed is prepared not to care if they put themselves at risk, since they do not perceive the risk to exist. Someone who trains themselves not be armed is someone prepared, willing or even eager for danger. They are willing for others to attempt harm on them, just as much as, eager that others put their lives in danger for a chance to prove a point. An untrained person is neither willing nor eager, instead they appear prepared merely to avoid any risk. As such, an un-armed person implies someone so reckless that their disregard is equivalent to being unprepared. While this may be hyperbole, I believe it conveys the idea of someone without the necessary training to safely handle and use Guncriminals. These are the people who are ""Trainers"" and ""Unaarms"".

 The term unarms is offensive in that it suggests the person carrying the gun does NOT care about their own personal safety, nor does the owner of that gun.  This is in direct opposition to what the 2nd amendment is all about.   The 2d amendment was put in place to protect the citizens of this country from tyrannical government.    The founders of our country were concerned that a tyrany government would take away their guns,  and this amendment protects them.     The idea that someone would not care for there own self is so offensive that Merriams dictionary has to classify it as an ""Offensive term"".

395,395,About to start!! SuccessConnect URL,"While the Tweet does contain derisive language towards a politician, and does express a negative opinion about a specific policy position, this does fall within the bounds of acceptable political discourse.

399,399,@USER I can see how frustrating that is. Conservatives will always get more praise for humane policies because it isn't neccessarily expected of them.,"Conservatives are not the only group that receives more positive praise than others for their humANE policies. For example, liberals are praised for being liberal, and progressives are often praised because of their progressive policies, even if those policies are more liberal than conservative policies (e.g. more progressive taxation). The conservative party is the party of ""free market"" economics, so it's not surprising that they receive more ""positive praise"" for those values. However, it would be considered offensive to call someone a ""conservative"" if they are a liberal. 
  

A:
According to this article, ""offensiveness"" is defined as: ""the perception of something as offensive based on its content, context, time, place, manner, intended audience, etc.""
So, in this case, I would say that the offensive part of the definition is ""perception"", not ""content"".
In this particular case the content is: 
""Cons:versants will ALWAYS get MORE PRAISE for HUMANE POLICIES because IT'S NOT NECESSARILY EXPECTED OF THEM."" 

 

This is an opinion, not a fact.  It's possible that people who are conservative may be praised more for having humaine policies than people that are liberal or progressive.

In addition, although the user's opinion is negative, they are not using derisive language or making any aggressive claims. Therefore, their tweet was classified in the non offensive category.

"
401,401,@USER @USER For what? Why are you asking for his arrest? Liberals being butthurt for 19 months is not an impeachable offense.,"This tweet does contain strong words, but they are not directed at any individual.

There is no evidence to suggest that @USERN has a history of engaging in abusive behavior on Twitter. 
  The user has expressed concern that another user is engaging or threatening to engage in violence. This is an expression of a personal opinion, and not a threat of violence against another person.

"
403,403,@USER You are such a comedian edd!!,"This tweet contains no explicit language that is offensive or racially derisive.

In fact, some of their other tweets seem to suggest that marijuana should be legalized. 
""Ree"", a slang term for ""recommend"", could also be interpreted as a positive term to describe someone who is enthusiastic about something they recommend. 
  

Overall, this tweet seems like a disagreement between two people about a political topic, and the use or nonuse of offensive terms is unlikely to change the outcome of this disagreement.

407,407,@USER @USER @USER is correct. Watch. Initial bump from SJWs but over the next few months will suffer significantly. Conservatives are patient.,"This tweet does contain an offensive term, ""suck"", which can be offensive to some people. However, it is not the only offensive word in the Tweet. In addition, this word is used in an ordinary way, as a verb, to describe the process of taking a substance into the mouth and gently pressing down on it, rather than using a more violent term such as ""chewing"" or ""swallowing"". The word ""bump"" is also an unusual choice of word, but it does have a neutral meaning of ""to increase in popularity"".

In summary, although the word used is offensive, in this case, I classified this as not offensive because it was used as an everyday verb and the context of the rest of Tweets in that conversation made it clear the users were expressing their opinion and not seeking to cause offense.

  The terms are generally considered to be offensive and derisive. 
   
  

'Terrorism': The word is generally used to refer to violence or the threat of violence against civilians, governments, or groups.  It is considered derision to use the word to describe a sport or hobby. 
Hate: Hate is a strong negative emotion or feeling towards someone or something. While it is not considered an offensive word, it can also be derided. For example, ""I don't like you, you're a hater."" 
     
Religion: Religion is often considered a sensitive topic, and many people may find deriding or criticizing a person or organization with a religious affiliation offensive or discriminatory.

However, it does express a view that some people may find controversial. Although the viewpoint is valid, this is not an offense in and of itself. 
  
Although the statement mentions a party, there is no indication that the person making the comment is affiliated with that party. Therefore, we do not consider this a endorsement of that view.

The word “libtarded” is also considered offensive, as it is used to describe someone who is easily influenced by liberal ideas. The use or threat of blocking someone for expressing a view is considered a form or aggression. 
  
Non-Offensiveness:

Explicitly nonoffensive language does include words or phrases like ""Republican"", ""whored"", and ""retarded"". However, these words and phrases are not considered derisive or offensive when used in a non offensively way. For example, ""Chances"" are ""chances"", not a derision. ""Libtards"" is not deriding, nor is it a slur.  ""Vile"" and similar words are considered to have no negative connotations.

In the context of this tweet and in the absence of any other information, this is a nonoffensiveness prediction.

In this case, I would classify the expression ""meltdown"" as offensive.  It's not a negative opinion, feeling, attitude, sensation, nor is it about any of those things. It's just a descriptive word for a very common reaction to being caught in an embarrassing situation, whether it's due to one's own actions or not.

422,422,President Trump has an announcement to make: DonaldTrump maga metoo URL,"President Donald Trump is an elected official, so the use and tone of his Twitter account is governed by the Twitter Rules. Under the rule 4.3, ""You may not use a false identity, account or other technology to impersonate another person."" The false-identity rule is intended to prevent individuals from using a third party's identity to post content without that third-party's consent. In this case, President Trump's account was impERSONATING another individual, @MAGA_URL, to tweet content. 
  
However, in this particular case the impostor's tweet was not false, as it was a parody of a real news story about a man who claimed to have met the president and that he was metrosexual. Therefore, this tweet does not violate the false identification rule. 
In addition, under the same rule, you may only use an account if you have the owner's explicit consent, including consent to cross-post content from other Twitter accounts. President Donald J. Trump did not explicitly consent for @Maga_Url to use his account, nor did he cross post from the account. Thus, it is also not in violation of this rule either.

  The slang term was used in an exaggerated manner, and the intended meaning was understood by the audience.

"
433,433,@USER @USER @USER That's literally in the Bible that conservatives love to thump but never read.,"In the United States, tweets are classified by the Internet Content Rating Association (ICRA) as either ""okay"", ""disputed"", or ""offense"". Disputed tweets may contain elements of truth, may be biased, or may not be hateful. Offensive tweets contain hate speech or other types of content that is likely to offend or disturb some audience members. Disputes about classification are resolved through a process of mediation by a third party. 
  
  The ICRA's mediation process is not available for public viewing. However, you can read the mediation agreement between the ICRAA and the Twitter user community.

"
434,434,@USER Gun control kills 3 more people.,"Gun control is controversial and could cause offense to some people. This tweet expresses the user's personal opinion on gun control and does so in an respectful way. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter API, ""non- offensive"" is the most common predicted classification for Tweets containing political discussion.

"
435,435,@USER He is reprehensible. Him and Durbin.,"@USER is a Twitter handle. 
He is an opinionated Twitter user. 
  The word reprehensive is defined as:

adjective: Reprehended; repugnant; odious; abhorrent
verb: to reprehensize; to reprimand;  to reprove.

"
436,436,@USER @USER @USER I’m not sure about your point with gun control and the NRA but I agree with you about selling liquor and still wanting people to drink responsibly. I would not be able to do it but I understand people in that industry do which makes good business sense for them.,"This tweet contains profane language but does so in a way that does
not directly insult or attack any person or groups based their
race, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, age, physical
appearance, mental or emotional health, religious beliefs,
political beliefs or activities. 
  
Instead, this tweet expresses a personal opinion on a topic that
may be contentious. While some may find the language offensive, 
   it does  not target any individuals or specific groups.

"
437,437,@USER He was the victim. Now let’s hear about her blood test since she is the perpetrator. What shape was she in?,"This tweet contains a slur against a group of people (lesbians).

While slurred words can be offensive, in this case, it is unclear what the slang term actually is. The slanguage is also used by non lesbian people, so it's not clear if the word is derrogatory towards lesbians or not. 
  
In addition, this tweet also contains an offensive term (perpetrator). 
   
However, there is no explicit derisive language in the rest of this message. In fact, most of it seems like a supportive message to a friend who is grieving.

"
438,438,@USER We apologize for the delay in response here and wanted to follow up and see if you are still experiencing issues. Our engineers are in the final stages of mitigating impact related to the event. ^MA,"While the original tweet contained offensive terms, it was not the primary purpose of this message. Instead, we were able to determine that the message was nonoffensiveness based on its tone and content.

"
439,439,@USER @USER Because he is a traitor,"Offensive language includes words like traitor, sell out, coward, etc. 
  Negative sentiment includes any expression of dislike or distaste.

"
440,440,@USER He can go to hell,"Offensive language: ""He can GO TO HELL""
Personal attacks: the individual making the comment is attacking the other individual, and does so by insinuating that they are a bad person and that the person they mentioned is in some way responsible for their misfortune. 
  The individual mentioned has not responded to the attack, so it is unclear whether they even saw the message.

"
441,441,@USER What do you like to do when you are with your family? AskAlly,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
It is more about the individual's hobbies than attacking or criticizing anyone. 
  

A:
According to this tweet by NYT, it is not offensive.

"
442,442,@USER @USER @USER @USER And you say liberals make false promises? How’s that wall coming? How’s that denuclearization of NK coming? How that “tax break” working out for you? Nice ole tariffs we got there huh? But yea keep on saying wild outlandish shit to make you feel better,"This tweet contains derisive language and slurs against several groups of people, including:
- People of color
  - African American
    - nigger

Language like this is not acceptable in any context, and is particularly offensive when used against people of African descent. 
  
@USER is a user account that has tweeted offensive comments in the past.

"
443,443,@USER Introducing my sweet sweet baby king! He is always sooo nice! And when I try to sit on the sofa he NEVER attacks me! URL,"This tweet contains a link to an online profile of the user. This profile describes the baby as ""sweet"" and the owner as a ""baby's mom"". The profile does mention that the mom has a tendency to ""attack"" the child when she sits on him, however, it does so in a nonoffensve manner. 
  
  The profile also describes how the parent has ""never attacked"" other children when they were sitting on their laps. In addition, there is no mention of any negative behavior towards other individuals or groups. 
Overall, this tweet can be classified in the non offensive category because it contains no offensive or derrogatory language and is targeted at a specific group of individuals.

"
444,444,@USER @USER @USER We all know death threat are a Resist/Antifa tactic.,"Death threat is a type of offensive communication that is often used by groups to intimidate or threaten individuals or groups. In this case, it seems that a user was death threatened by an individual who was using a derisive term to describe the Antifas movement. This type off death threats is not offensive. 
  
Antifascist is an offensive term that can be used to insult someone who supports fascists. Although the Twitter user in this example used it in a positive context, they were still the target of death threatening messages. Therefore, this term is offensive and should be avoided.

"
445,445,@USER Didn’t break rules. Had permission. A liar.,"In the context of this tweet and in the absence of context, it's difficult to determine whether the profane language was used in jest or whether it reflects the speaker's true feelings. However, given the nature of Twitter, profanities are often used lightly and without intent to cause offense.

"
446,446,@USER @USER Fair point but i didnt make the meme and couldnt take the big gov sucks off of it. And besudes meddling in many counties politics and economics. He funds antifa black lives matter to try and divide we the people to try and tear the country apart URL,"While the content of the Tweet is critical of Jeff's political views, there is no explicit language targeting an individual, group, race or gender. 
  
  The Tweeter is criticizing Jeff for his political beliefs, but is also expressing their own opinions about groups that the Twitter user does and does'nt like. 
In the last part of their TWEET, they mention that Jeff funds Antifa, Black Lives Matter and other groups. This is an opinion, not a direct attack on a person or a group.

"
447,447,@USER @USER @USER Alaska Girl chiming in...if Murkowski votes yes she is done for!! From what I know most native tribes have told her to vote no! Kavanaugh on scotus would decimate Alaska Natives!!,"This tweet contains a derisive term for Alaska Native people, ""Alaska Girl."" The term is derrogatory and offensive, and the user using it has a history of making offensive statements. 
  
  Additionally, this tweet links to an article that contains information that is not supported by the author. This is another reason the term "" Alaska girl "" is offensive.

"
448,448,@USER Good idea. They need to protect our borders more than they need to be overseas.,"This tweet expresses a neutral sentiment. 
It simply states a fact, without any personal opinion or criticism towards a specific group or individual. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as ""explicitly promoting racism, sexism, homophobia, or other forms of bigotry"".
In this case, it is hard to classify the Tweet as offensive, because the word ""lol"" can be used in many contexts, and it does contain a positive connotation. However, in this context, I think it's fair to say that ""rolling on floor laughing"" could be considered offensive.

"
449,449,@USER lmaooo. girl you are lyingggg. it didn’t take two weeks for them to take all this money for these tickets i purchased! but thanks girl lol,"This tweet contains a humorous reference to the time it took for Ivana Trump to sell her jewelry on eBay. Ivanna Trump was forced to auction off her personal belongings after divorcing Donald Trump, including her wedding ring and several pieces of jewelry. 
  
  The reference is based on an exaggeration, as it did not take Ivarna Trump two whole weeks to complete the auction. It took her about a week.

"
450,450,@USER Cue the gun control crowd.,"This tweet is not offensive. Although it is possible to interpret it as an offensive remark based on its context, it does contain humerous remarks. 
  
  The Antifas tweet was based off of a news article about an encounter between Antiffas and a man they did not know. Antfas were surprised by the man, who they had been expecting. This unexpected encounter was captured on camera and went viral. In the news story, Antfa said ""you are missin' brains?"" in response to the encounter.

"
451,451,@USER @USER Like Antifa hiding their faces?,"Antifa is a left-wing extremist group that has committed violent attacks on people and property. Their violent tactics are not condoned by the American left, nor are they reflective of mainstream leftist thought. 
  
@user Like is an expression of approval. Like! Like it! 
   
In this context, Antifas' attempt to hide their identities is not offensive. They are hiding from the public, not from @user.

"
452,452,@USER @USER @USER @USER Pre-existing clause is still there. That’s the one good thing about ACA. The only ones I hear talking about taking it away is the liberals. It’s a scare tactic IMO.,"This tweet contains a pre-exisiting clause, ""that’'s one thing good about Obamacare,"" which indicates that the author is making a comparison between the ACHA and another policy. This is a common tactic used by politicians to make a point without directly criticizing another individual. In this case, this is an example of a liberal critic of the Affordable Care Act making the same point that a conservative critic would make. 
  
While the statement is not offensive, there is no explicit mention of any individual, group, organization, etc. that is being specifically targeted. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the comment is directed at a specific group or individual and therefore classified it as offensive.

"
453,453,@USER @USER Cult religion?,"While the use of the word ""cult"" is offensive, its use in this context is not directed at any one person or group. Rather, this is an example of a user expressing their opinion on a topic. 
  
  The predicted labels for this tweet are:
- Offensive: the mention the words ""25th amendment"" and ""obama"" in close proximity is derisive and offensive

A:

  While it's not a direct attack, I would classify this as offensive.  It's a strong word to use to describe a group of people.

"
454,454,@USER @USER @USER The title of the book pretty much sums up any conversation with Avram. He is either a shill for the criminal @USER or really is mentally incapable of understanding facts that contradict his brainwashing. URL,"Offensive language: the word ""shill"" is considered offensive by many, and the term is often used to describe someone who is acting as an agent or representative of a party or organization for financial or other reasons, without necessarily believing in the party's or organizations' ideology or goals. 
  
Personal attacks: Avrom is being described as ""mentally incapable"" of engaging with facts or arguments that do not align with his pre-existing beliefs. This is an insult, as mental capacity is not a disability.

"
455,455,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER The deeper in they get the less likely to scrap or even stop... we need it scrapped now before more wasted on it and before more contracts signed.,"This tweet contains profane language but is primarily focused around opinions about how the show ""The Last of Us"" is handling certain plot points. While the language is inappropriate for an official ESPN account, its use is more informal, so it was not considered offensive by the model. 
  
  The model also considered the context of the overall conversation, in which the Twitter user is encouraging others to support a political candidate. This is a non offensive way to encourage others.

"
456,456,@USER @USER tough to speak your mind at work if your a conservative..amazing that this occurred in work setting. Bizarre.,"This tweet contains a reference to a work environment, where conservative employees are sometimes restricted from expressing their opinions. In this case, it is unclear whether the restriction is due to company policy or just a cultural difference, so it's difficult to determine if the statement is offensive or not. 
  
  The statement itself is not offensive, however, because it simply expresses the observation that it can be challenging to express one's opinions in conservative work environments.

"
457,457,@USER @USER Yeah we need gun laws like Europe so it's really hard for bad people to get guns. URL You people are clueless about guns,"This tweet contains a slur against a group of people, namely ""URL"" people. This slurred group is associated with negative attributes such as ""cluelESS"" in this case. 
  
  The slang term "" URL "" is derisive and offensive towards people who use the internet.  It is also possible that the slant of the Tweet is negative towards those who disagree with gun control.   

While the sentiment of this Tweep is positive, there is still a negative slanted TWEET towards a specific group.

"
458,458,@USER @USER This B**ch Behar needs to shut that big ugly hole on her face and think about the fact she's not giving Kavanaugh or his family the benefit of their rights as citizens. In her fat head they're guilty bc they're Conservatives. Behar needs a muzzle around decent people. HRC clone.,"In the first sentence, ""Shut that B***h hole"" is an explicit and offensive insult. 
""In her big fathead"" refers to Beahar, so it could also be considered offensive as an insult to her weight.

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, a tweet that is offensive or abusive is one that:  uses abusive language; promotes, encourages, incites or engages in the targeted abuse of abuse; misrepresents; or is otherwise inappropriate.  The guidelines also state that abusive behavior can include targeted harassment, stalking, intimidation, ʻoutingʼ (identifying someoneʹs real name), and other forms of bullying.

"
459,459,@USER @USER @USER @USER Red roses swarm. Conservatives pounce. We need our own verb.,"While the use the word ""swarm"" in this context may be considered offensive, it's not the only offensive word in that tweet and is not central to its meaning. The rest of the message is a humorous description of a political situation, with a clear positive message about conservatives and a suggestion for a new verb to describe their actions and beliefs.

"
460,460,I wonder if any of the MAGA people that try to follow me are hoping to maybe get better knowledge or maybe they want to change. And then I go and block them. Maybe that’s why they never change. :man_shrugging: ,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language. 
It is targeting a certain group of people, namely those who support President Trump. 
  The use of swear words and targeting of this group could be seen as offensive.

"
461,461,@USER @USER Don’t usually do Twitter”conversations”but my point was Dana may be kind of woman who doesn’t want to help other woman;wants to be THE prima donna &amp; so doesn’t care about developing next-gen girls.She is against gun control &amp; isn’t bothered by school shootings-must not like kids,"This tweet contains a stereotype about women, who are often described as being ""prima donnas"" who don't want help from other women. This stereotypical view of women is not supported by the text of the original tweet. 
  
  The author of this tweet may have been referring to Dana White, a Canadian politician and former leader of Ontario's Liberal Party. However, it's not clear from the context of that tweet that the author was referring specifically to her.

"
462,462,@USER @USER Then she should step down. It's not about her. She was elected by liberals. She has power cuz of liberals.,"This tweet contains derisive language and personal attack, such as ""liberals"" and ""step down.""
Ivanka Trump is an influential figure in the United States government and business. Her father is the president of United states. Therefore, she is arguably one the most powerful women. However, this tweet suggests that she does nothing more than follow the orders of others. This is derrogatory and not supportive of women empowerment. 
  

A:
According to this article, Ivankatse is actually a slang word for vagina.  So, it's possible that the author of this answer was trying to say that Ivana Trump was not empowered, and that this was a derogaous slur.

Please help her tonight!! URL … URL,"This tweet includes a link to an external website. While the website is not explicitly offensive, it contains adult content and may be inappropriate for some users. We classify this tweet as potentially offensive. 
While the link is to another website, we classify the message as not containing any direct offensive terms or language. However, this website contains explicit adult material, and some people may find it inappropriate.

This is what the Resistance looks like.""""""","While the use of the word ""stall"" in this context could potentially be offensive, in context, this is a derisive remark about a political strategy. It is unlikely that the author would use derision towards a person or a movement in their tweets, especially when the target is someone who is being persecuted for their political beliefs.

"
465,465,. there he is; theirs the first baby; growing so fast; how cute; fabulous to see him again thanks for sharing URL,"There is nothing offensive in this tweet; it simply expresses a sentiment of congratulation and appreciation for the baby's appearance. 
This tweet contains no explicit derisive terms or offensive phrases. 
  The use the emojis of claps and hands with light-skinned tones are used to emphasize the positive message of this message.

"
466,466,"""@USER Doesn't ALTERNATIVE FACT"""" = FALSEHOOD? MAGA @USER @USER @USER @USER How do """"Alt"""" gov accounts exist? How many accounts? Illegal? Subverting will of the people? Who runs? Who pays? Where from? IP address tracking?""""""","This tweet contains a reference to a popular meme on Twitter. In the memes description, it states that Alternative Facts do not exist, which is a common claim in the alt-right movement. However, this is not an explicit threat of violence, nor does it contain offensive terms or references to personal assault. 
  
  The author is expressing an opinion based off of a current political debate, rather than explicitly threatening violence.

"
467,467,@USER Hillary was counting chickens before they were hatched remember?,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or slur. 
It does, however, contain a reference to a popular TV show. 
  This reference is not essential to understanding the message of this tweet.

"
468,468,@USER I completely agree! We can uphold the second amendment AND have common sense gun control. I’m a responsible gun owner. But no citizen needs military grade weapons or high capacity magazines. To find the problem: follow the $!,"A:

I agree with the classification. The Tweet is positive and appreciates the following person. No offensive terms are used and the mention of military-grade weapons and high-capacity magazines is just a joke.

"
469,469,@USER @USER @USER @USER She is weak and this is her excuse to use her vote pro Kavanaugh,"This tweet contains no explicit or implicit offensive terms or phrases. 
It is not focused solely on one topic. 
  It does express a view on Kavanaugh's confirmation, but it does so in a supportive manner.

"
470,470,5/5 Canada has regulated firearms since the last quarter of the 19th century. Those laws have probably contributed to Canada having only 1% as many handguns in circulation as in the US. URL,"While the mention ""5 / 5 Canada"" is not explicit, it is likely a reference to 5/10, a Canadian maths problem where 5 is divided by 10 and the result is 5. In this case, 5 / 10 = 5, which means 5 out 5 = 1 is the actual number. This is an example of an explicit number that is unlikely to cause offense. 
Canada has had a regulated firearm system since at least the late 19 th century, so the prediction is correct.

"
471,471,@USER you are some basic white girl who clearly didn’t know any of them personally and it’s awful what has happened to Mac so why don’t you pay respect to that instead of being disgusting and blaming another innocent human in something that has nothing to do with them.,"Although the first part of the original tweet does contain some offensive terms and phrases, such as ""sucking around"" and ""hero,"" the rest of it expresses the opinion of a user who is frustrated with another individual's stance, and does so in a way that is not explicit or offensive, so the overall tweet can be classified both as nonoffensiveness and as a statement of opinion. 
"
472,472,@USER She’s not trying to be a better person she is just trying to save herself from all the horrible things she did!!,"This tweet does contain some offensive terms and phrases, but they are used in a joking manner and are not meant to offend anyone. For example, ""horrible things"" is a phrase used to describe something that is bad or undesirable. In this context, this phrase is used as a way to make a point about the negative impact that one can have on themselves. 
  
In addition, there is also a use in this sentence of ""trying to,"" which can also be interpreted as an attempt. This is meant as humoring, as it is an exaggeration of what someone is actually trying or attempting to do.

"
473,473,MAGA :thumbs_up: KEEPING AMERICA GREAT :thumbs_up: URL,"In the example above, @user is a user of Twitter. The word ""ass"" is considered to contain offensive terms in some languages. @USER is the username of that user and she's from the United States. 
@USER is an account that follows the user @User. 
  The account @USA is owned by Twitter and is used to express political opinion. In this case, Twitter wants to emphasize the positive aspects of its relationship with the US.

  The use 'just' instead of actually stating what the speaker is feeling, which is likely frustration. 
There is no derision or sarcastic tone in this TWEET.

"
475,475,"""@USER @USER I'm waiting for the snow-flake conservatives"""" to become transparent in the SCOTUS process.""""""","This tweet contained a term that is generally considered to have a pejorative connotation, such as ""liar"" or ""strike again"".

In this specific case, ""Snow-Flake"" is a slang term for a conservative. 
  
  The term ""conservatives"" can also be a generic term to refer to any group of people. In this case the term is used to describe a person, and the accusation that the person is ""waiting for something"" implies that they are being dishonest. This accusation is also considered highly offensive.

"
476,476,@USER I loved her since victorious. She was my first girl crush but when I first heard The Way I became a hardcore stan.,"Offensive language includes explicit slur words or derogsatory words for a person's race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc. 
Emojis can express negative feelings but they cannot be considered offensive unless they contain offensive words. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, you can't use emojis to express offensive feelings.

"
477,477,@USER @USER I see May in the same light as yourself. Even the last election was about her and not the Conservatives. A split is coming to the Tory partyvery soon!,"While the prediction is based on May's political party, she is not personally attacked in any way. She is simply mentioned in comparison to another person. This is an example of a non offensive prediction. 
"
478,478,StopBrexit PeoplesVote @USER and @USER need to listen to the experts! :woman_facepalming_medium_skin_tone: URL,"While the content of the Tweet is lighthearted and does contain some personal attack, there is no explicit language that would be considered offensive.

Therefore, this Tweets does appear to come from a person who is passionate about their message and is trying to encourage others to take action.

URL""","While the sentiment of ""guilt"" is not necessarily offensive, using the example of someone accusing someone else of sexual assault to ""prove"" that assault is offensive. 
  
  The example used in the Tweet, ""a woman"" accusing ""her husband,"" ""son,"" or ""dad"" of assault, is an example that is often used by Democrats to attack Republicans. Using this example to prove guilt is another form of Democrat ""motive-based"" politics, where the guilt of one party is used to target and attack the other. This is considered offensive by many. 
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/07/democrats-accuse-patriots-of-sexism-and-racism

A:
According to this article, Democrats have used the accusation of rape as a political tactic against Republicans for decades.  Using the evidence of an assault that never happened to try and get someone convicted of something they didn't do is clearly offensive to many people, so using this as proof that the accused did commit the assault would be offensive as well.

480,480,.@USER HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT against the POOREST and most VULNERABLE in our society just keeps on rolling. So much for ChristianMorals eh? If you voted for this SHIT then HANG YOUR HEAD IN SHAME. @USER JC4PMNow POVERTY DisabilityRights URL,"This tweet contains a slur against a group of people, namely ""poorer"" and ""vulnerable"".

While slurred words are offensive, this slang term is used by many groups of individuals to refer to each other, and is not derisive towards any specific group or individual. 
  
  The use the word ""shame"" in a non deriding manner, further indicates that this tweet does express a congratulation. 
There is nothing offensive in this Tweet.

"
481,481,@USER Antifa is Israel's thug squad in America,"Antifa, a far-left group, is often associated with violence. 
  The word Israel is also considered offensive, as it's associated
  with the country's occupation of Palestine.

482,482,@USER Trump will blame it on the immigrants for coming and 'liberals' for noticing. He likely thinks Head Start/HIV are wasteful spending. Comgress can no longer pass 'broad' budgets. They will need to itemize every $ and forbid diversion without Congressional permission,"This tweet does express a negative opinion of Donald Trump, and it is not appropriate for a public figure to express such opinions. However, it also does state facts about the current state of affairs in Washington, D.C., and the policies of President Trump. Therefore, this tweet can be classified in two different ways:

As nonoffensiveness, because although it expresses a critical opinion, its nature is harmless. 
Or as offensive, as it uses derrogatory terms and expresses negative sentiments.

"
483,483,@USER @USER @USER And they did. PR is a shit hole run by corrupt Liberals. It was DESTROYED and it will take years and years and years to rebuild.,"Offensive language and derogy terms are used in this tweet. 
Machine GunKelly is mentioned in relation to gun violence. This is offensive because MachineGunKelly has made controversial statements about gun laws and is known for his violent lyrics. 
  
@user eminem is referenced in reference to his response on gun controls. The use of the word ""do"" in ""Do gun controllers have a right to vote?"" is derogaatory because the use or reference of ""gun controllers"" is controversial.  The useof theword ""machine gun""is offensivebecause Machine gun Kelly has used the phrase ""Machine gunKelly"" as a derisive nickname for other artists.

"

It does, however, make a derisive remark about the user's location. Ross-endal is a district in Greater Manchester, England, and Hull is the county town of East Yorkshire. 
  
Although the remark is derisor, it doesn't contain offensive words or slang.

sounds warm and fuzzy but is actually a lie. In reality she will do
nothing to help the Muslims. Instead she is focused only on
protecting herself and her party. By promising more resources to
the muslins, May is trying to get elected. However, she does so at
great personal cost to herself. May's actions are political
suicide.

486,486,@USER @USER Get her underoath and if she lies she should go to jail just like everyone else who lies if she is telling the truth she has nothing to worry about,"This tweet contains a derisive term for a group of people, but it also contains an explanation of why the term is derrogatory. 
  
  The term ""lumpen"" is used to describe a low-class person. In this context, ""Lumpens"" refers to people who are uneducated and who do not take their responsibilities in society seriously. This term may be deriding to some, however, this user is warning the other users of the dangers of being complacent and not taking their roles seriously, just as any good teacher would do.

487,487,@USER @USER John Kerry is a swamp rat nothing more nothing less CNN we all know is the clown news network,"Offensive language includes words or phrases such as ""pig,"" ""filthy,"" or ""disgusting.""
Personal attacks include statements that target individuals personally, such a calling them names or making false claims about their character.

488,488,@USER @USER confession. i was pregnant with your child after our second makeout. he is 7 years old tomorrow.,"This tweet contains a reference to a past event, where the referenced person was the second person the person had a sexual encounter with. This is not an offensive reference, as it is common for people to have more than two sexual partners. 
  
However, this reference is potentially harmful to the child of the referred person, because of its age. Offensive references to children are not allowed on Twitter.

489,489,I think @USER knows what he's doing. It's a lose-lose proposition no matter what he does. Kind of like being a referee at a dog fight. I'll reserve judgement until Monday.

It is possible that the user who sent the original tweet may have been unaware of this website. In this case, please explain how the website could have possibly been aware of these tweets.

According to this article, Twitter has a ""hateful conduct"" policy.  It's not clear to me if that's the same as a hate speech policy, though.

490,490,@USER Are @USER and @USER all over this? Gun control Utopia Chicago needs them right about now. JustDoIt UsOpen Serena MAGA URL,"This tweet does contain an offensive term, ""MAGA"" (which stands for ""Make America Great Again""). However, this term is not used in a derrogatory way, and it is used positively in this context. Additionally, there is nothing in that tweet that would indicate that this user is trying to harm the referenced user, so this label would be inappropriate.

"
491,491,2019 tours will include flights and hotels.,"This tweet does not contain any offensive language, nor does it target a person or a group based on their race, religion, gender, or any other characteristic. 
  The message encourages people to attend the tour, regardless of their personal circumstances. This is an encouraging message that is generally considered positive.

"
492,492,@USER Tina. She's traumatized and hated by Conservatives.,"This tweet does contain strong and offensive words, but they are not directed at any particular individual. They are instead an expression of the opinion that Tina is traumatically affected by conservatives. 
  
Although the word ""traumatize"" is offensive, its use in this context is justified. Tina has experienced a traumatic event, namely being hated and disliked by conservative Americans. This is a form of trauma that can be traumas such as war, natural disasters, etc. In this case, Tina's experience of being disfavored by Americans is analogous to being traumuated by them. Therefore, this use of ""traumatic"" in context of Tina seems nonoffensiv.

"
493,493,@USER @USER Why don't liberals understand that an allegation of drunk teenagers who don't have sex is not a federal crime? Golly Moses- What is wrong with those people?,"Liberals do not understand why an accusation of underage drinking is a crime. 
  The use and context of swear words in this tweet are offensive, and could be seen as targeting a specific group of people.

494,494,Florida what did we do??? This only adds to the concerns that gun rights activists have with Ron DeSantis.  He voted in favor of adding the Feinstein-backed “Fix NICS” gun control expansion to the Omnibus spending bill in Congress... URL,"While the URL contains derisive language and a personal attack, this is not the offensive content that the model is looking for. URL is an acronym for ""Uniform Act Regulating Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs"" and refers to a bill that would have made it more difficult for the government to seize assets from drug traffickers. While this bill was not passed, its opponents have long claimed that it would make it harder to convict drug dealers, and De Santis voted for it.

"
495,495,@USER @USER @USER Now the leftist needs to condemn the violence of antifa,"Antifa is an acronym for Anti-Fascist Action, a left-wing activist group that opposes far-right groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and the National Socialist Movement. Antifascists are known for their black masks, helmets, and other equipment used in street fights with their opponents. 
  
Violence is often associated with Antfafa, as they have been known to use violence against their political opponents, including the police. However, Antfaifa is also a nonviolent organization that promotes nonviolence and oppostion of fascism. Therefore, it's not clear that the Antfatfa tweet should be considered offensive.

"
496,496,@USER @USER So What? We all have concerns on gun control but one man is not going to change our problem. It is much deeper than that.,"This tweet does contain an explicit reference to the use of the US 25 th Amendment, a rarely used constitutional amendment that allows for the removal of a president who is deemed mentally unfit. 
  
  The 25-th amendment is rarely, if ever, used, so the model is likely overfitting on this particular tweet.

"
497,497,@USER Go crash another plane.,"This tweet contains a slur, insult, derogy, threat, and/or explicit content that is offensive. 
  
  The slang word used in the context of a plane crash is not considered derrogatory. However, if the user was not familiar with the slanguage, they could interpret the statement as derisive.

It does contain a reference to E minem, but it does so in a way that is not derisive or negative. E.g., it's not a direct quote from the song ""Killshot.""
While the content of this tweet may be offensive to some, it was not offensive enough to classify it as offensive.

"
499,499,@USER @USER Abso-fucking-lutely. That shit was here already!,"Offensive language includes words like 'faggot','retard', and 'pussy'.

Negative sentiment includes phrases like, 'that shit', which are used to express dislike or disapproval. 
  
There is a negative tone in the above tweet. The tone conveys that Jackie is not welcome in this space, and the user is frustrated by her presence. This is an offensive tweet as negative tones are not allowed on Twitter.

URL,"While the content of this tweet may not be offensive on its own, its author is a member of an organization that has a history of engaging in harassment and violence. 
This organization has also been found to have used deceptive tactics to conceal its violent activities. 
  
In addition, this organization's leader has expressed support for violent tactics and has even praised the use of violence against political opponents.

"
501,501,@USER Link me and knuckles then or you going to dodge like the creddy you are,"While the language in the Tweet is lighthearted, there is a clear negative sentiment towards the individual referenced in that Tweets. This is because the person in question is described as ""creddy"" and ""dodge,"" which are derisive terms used to describe someone who is untrustworthy or evasive. 
  
In addition, although the content of the link is unknown, its presence in this context is likely to evoke negative feelings towards unethical behavior.

"
502,502,@USER I'm sure many of us conservatives will remember your participation in the overriding of our constitutional right and will never vote for any of this so called government the one that flaunts or laws and court system,"This tweet does contain derrogatory words, such as ""government"", ""overriding"", and ""constitutional"". However, these words are used in a critical context, referring to a specific case in which the President of US used his executive power to override the right of American citizens to keep and bear Arms. In this context the words do not apply to this President, who is not a government or a constitutional authority. 
In addition, this tweet also contains offensive words such ""gun"", which can be interpreted as a derisive reference to firearms. However this word is used here in its proper meaning, to refer to an instrument for propelling a projectile. 
  
Overall, in this particular context this is an argument against gun regulation, not for it.

505,505,@USER @USER @USER Please stick to Bakersfield issues and resign from House Leadership. You are illiterate in economics and the Constitution and take too many bribes! NoSpeakerMcCarthy I’m for @USER,"This tweet contains a derisive term for a person's profession, as Speaker of House is a high-level position in government. However, Speaker is also a title that is bestowed upon members of Congress based on their leadership abilities and contributions to the body. McCarthy is the former House Speaker, who resigned in disgrace in 1995 after being accused of taking bribesto help convicted felon James McCormick, a member of his staff. 
  
Speakers of both the House and Senate are elected by their respective bodies, so it's not necessarily ill-advised for members to hold multiple positions at the same time. Additionally, McCaul is an outspoken critic of Trump and has previously called for his resignation. This tweet does contain a slight insult to McCarthy's intelligence, however, this is balanced out by the fact that the term is used in a joking manner.

It is a simple statement of opinion. 
  

A:
According to this tweet classification model, ""non- offensive"" is most likely the correct classification for this Tweet.  The model is not able to determine any of these terms: ""dumb"", ""ignorant"", or ""bitch"".  It does determine that this is an expression or opinion, which is considered non offensive in this classification.

"
507,507,@USER Zimmerman belongs in prison for killing Travon Martin. Florida needs to change its gun control laws.,"This tweet expresses an unpopular opinion about gun laws in Florida. However, it does so in an nonoffensve way, expressing a desire for a change in gun law without targeting any individuals or groups in particular. 
  
  The user mentions a recent shooting in which a young man was killed, but does this in order to express his opinion, not to attack the shooter or call for more gun restrictions.

These Antifa Ninja Turtles running around acting like jihadist and never lived a real life experience. Most of these Antifa colleges kids are White privileged,"Most of the words used in this tweet are derisive terms for people of African descent. 
  The word ""Demonratic"" is a derision for a political party. 
""Ninja"" and ""Turtle"" are offensive slurs for African-American people. ""Ninjas"" in particular are associated with the Japanese military and espionage.

"
509,509,@USER lemme rap on that shit. I'll do a video floatin downstream in a coffin like in horrorland lol,"This tweet contains the offensive word lewd.

510,510,@USER @USER This is dumb! What is the point?,"Offensive language is defined as ""language or expression that is directed at people based on their attributes such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, and other factors."" The offensive content in the Tweet is based off of the users being a politician and the political stance they hold. This makes the content offensive because it is targeting a specific group based upon their political beliefs. 
  

Non-Offensiveness: ""The content is neither offensive nor nonoffending. There is no personal attack, derision, hate, ridicule, etc. in this content.""
OFFENSIVE: ""@USER Thought they'd score 69, but they actually scored 0 points! Sad""
This tweet contains offensive slang and language. Offensive slangs and phrases include ""sad"", ""score"", and ""points"". The slanguage is used in an offensive way to express disappointment, mockery, sarcasm, humor, pity, sympathy, regret, disgust, contempt, scorn, jeer, sneer or deride.

"
511,511,"""@USER @USER Those other three are activist judges"""". They must be conservatives!""""""","""activist judges"": This is an offensive term to describe the other two candidates. The other candidates are not ""activists,"" they are politicians who are running for office. 
""'Those other four are activists too': This sentence is confusing. ""Those"" could refer to either the three other judges or the four other people. If the latter, then the sentence would be true. However, if the former, this sentence does nothing to explain the relationship between the judges and other politicians.

Both individuals mentioned in it are well-known actors from the 1970s, and the author is merely expressing their opinion on who is more credible. This is an innocuous tweet that does no harm to anyone. 
  

A:
According to this article, Twitter's TOS, ""harassment"" is defined as: ""directly or indirectly making a threat or menacing gesture or communication.""
In this case, I think the ""menacing"" part of that definition is the key.  The language is definitely profane, as well as derisive, so I would classify this as harassment.

"
513,513,@USER She is among friends...IRA friends. A terrorist loves a terrorist.,"This tweet contains derisive terms for people of a particular ethnic group. 
  
  The term ""terrorist"" is derrogatory. 
""Friends"" can be interpreted as a derision for a group of people. ""IRAFriends"", ""FRIENDS"", or ""friends of friends"" are derided terms used to describe people who do not belong to a specific group, such as friends of immigrants, friends with benefits, or friends who like different types of music.

"
514,514,@USER @USER Your statement sums up the Lib Dem party tbh Brett. And the Conservatives....... and the Labour Party......... What a sorry state we are in!!,"This tweet expresses a positive view on gun rights and does so without using offensive or derisive language. 
  The user does mention that there are other parties who support gun restrictions, but the language is neutral and nonoffensiveness is inferred from the overall tone of support for gun ownership.

"
515,515,@USER Dig up Frankie. Save yourself.,"Frankie is the last person the Antifas wanted to answer too. This is an allusion to the song ""Franklina"" by the American rapper A$AP Rocky. In the lyrics, Franklinda is described as the ""last person"" theAntifras wantedto answer to.

516,516,@USER He is such a good dude! Where do you work?,"@USER is a direct message to another Twitter user. Based on context, @USER appears to have been responding to the original Tweet. In addition, there is no evidence that @USR targeted any individuals or groups in an offensive manner, nor is there evidence of strong or harsh language.

517,517,"""@USER No she hasn't. What reform""""? She is getting Trump to free particular famous people, in exchange for attention. The policies are worse now.""""""","This tweet contains a derisive term for a woman, ""she"".
It does contain offensive terms and language. ""What reform"" is a sarcastic reference to the fact that the President of United States, Donald Trump (the user), has proposed no reforms to gun laws. 
  ""She is gettin Trump"" to ""free particularfamous people"" in ""exchange forattention"" refers to a conspiracy theory that President Trump is being held hostage in order to get him to pass gun reform. This conspiracy is false.

"
518,518,@USER Heck yeah. And also she IS cool,"This tweet does contain derrogatory words, but they are used in an offensive way. Specifically, ""cow"" is used to refer to an animal, and ""pardon"" refers to the legal process of giving someone a second chance. Additionally, there is a clear lack of respect for the individual in this tweet. ""Don't worry. I'm over fifty. Pardon me if I don't vote"" implies that the person in question is not old enough to have a vote, does so without any respect, then goes on to express concern that they may not get a pardon if they vote against the Democratic party. This is offensive.

"
519,519,@USER LOL you escaped some shit then... even if I don't regret watching it for a minute. LoyalWolf,"Offensive language: ""typical"", ""shit"", and ""nothing tosee here"" are offensive words. 
Personal attacks: the use of profanities and derision in the original tweet are examples of personal attack. 
	""Typical... when its backfired its nothing here to behold"" is a derisive comment about Trump's supporters.  
	The use ""move along"" and other similar phrases are forms of dismissal.

520,520,...by marginalizing conservatives politically (not civically) for a generation. Relegated to minority status. Ideas thoroughly disproven and ignored.,"This tweet contains offensive terms and language. The terms are ""ideas,"" ""disproves,"" and ""ignored.""

However, it does contain a positive sentiment, and the language is only derisive. 
  
  The sentiment is derision, but the terms used are factual. 
Ideas are facts. Disproving ideas is factually disproving facts, not ideas. Ignoring ideas does nothing to change the facts of their existence.

According to the Twitter API, ""user"" is a collection of attributes that can be used to identify a user.  One of those attributes is ""lang"", which can have the values ""en"", ""es"", or ""ja"".  The ""User: @user @lang"" format is used in Twitter Search to return only tweets in that language (or en, es, ja, etc.).  
In this case, @USER is the username of Twitter user @User, who posted the original tweet about Antifas. @LANG is en or es or ja.

It is not possible to determine the intended meaning of a slang term or phrase based on its use in a Tweets.

According to the Twitter's Terms of Service, ""harassment"" is defined as ""a knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a person on account of that person’s race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, personal appearance, sex, marital status, political affiliation, poverty status or other characteristics""

524,524,@USER He's going to need a pair of running shoes so he can look for work when he's sees we're not supporting his dumb ass movies anymore. :woman_shrugging: walkaway,"This tweet contains an explicit slur against women, specifically women who are considering voting for Hillary Clinton. 
  
  ""woman"" is a derisive term for women in general. While it is not considered offensive on its own, when used in combination with ""shrug"" it can have a very negative connotation. ShruGGing is an action where a person will raise their eyebrows and look down or away from the speaker, often as a sign of contempt or disbelief. In this case, ""woman shruGging"" means that the woman is looking down and away, implying that she is uninterested in what the person is saying. This slang term is commonly used by young men who do not have the respect for or understanding of women that older generations of men might have.

525,525,@USER @USER Did he mock a Liberal MP crossing the floor to join the Conservatives because it is evidence that they are basically the same party?,"This tweet contains no derrogatory or harmful language.

"
526,526,@USER Everyone in Washington including John Heinz is being uncovered as the corrupt elites they are...Like cockroaches running from the light.,"Offensive language and/or derogaatory words are used in the Tweet. 
  The word ""elites"" is derrogatory and offensive towards the group of people called ""Washington"". 
 The use and repetition of the word cockraoch in this context is offensive and derogsatory.

"
527,527,@USER Ahhh how the left punishes it’s soldiers. Today is your last day=don’t forget your 6 million dollar goodbye check. Thanks for supporting the cause.,"This tweet contains a call to action to donate to a specific cause. This is a non offensive way to encourage people to support a cause, as long as the call for donations is clearly marked as a request for support and not an order. 
  
However, this is also a possible offensive interpretation of this message. In this case, ""soldiers"" could refer to Trump's supporters, who are often referred to as ""patriots"" in conservative circles. If this interpretation is correct, then the message could also be considered offensive, because the author is encouraging people not to forget to send ""six million dollars"" to ""the cause"" of supporting Trump, even though the actual cause is unrelated to supporting or opposing Trump and the money is being asked for for a completely different reason.

  The text is asking a question about a historical event, and the question is not offensive. Additionally, it contains no personal attack, derrogatory term, offensive word, nor any other offensive sentiment.

"
530,530,@USER @USER @USER She is a role model Adam you are not!,"While the use and context of certain words and phrases can influence whether they are considered derisive or not, in this case the context and tone suggest that the word ""role model"" was used in jest. Additionally, while the profane word is offensive, it is used within the same context as the other words in the Tweet, and does little to further the offensive sentiment of this Tweeter.

"
531,531,@USER He should be talking about the Chinese leader seeing they pollute the most.,"This tweet does contain an offensive slur, ""jews."" However the slurred word is used metaphorical, and is not intended to refer to any specific group of people. The slurse is also used in a non offensive way in the rest of the text. 
  
  The offensive nature of this slush can be judged by the context. In the original context, @user is making a comparison between the leader of a country and a group that is often referred to as a parasite. This is a slang term used to describe a person who takes advantage of others for financial gain. By using this term in this context it is likely that @User was trying to make a point about corruption in politics.

  The TWEET does contain a direct insult towards a person, in that the word ""joke"" is used to describe the individual. While this is an informal word, its use in this context is likely to cause offence to the intended recipient.

It simply states an obvious fact about the generosity of the person who is thanked. 
  This is not a controversial statement and is therefore non offensive.

"
535,535,@USER @USER Also he is not even ACCUSED of rape.,"Offensive language is defined as ""words, phrases, images, etc. that denigrate human dignity or that incite violence against an individual or a group"". The definition of offensive is subjective and depends on context, so it is difficult to provide a general rule for determining whether or not something is offensive, but generally offensive words or phrases are those that are derisive, demeaning, insulting, provocative, biased, prejudicial, bigoted, racist, homophobic, sexist, ageist or otherwise offensive based on a person's race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, socioeconomic status or any other characteristic. 
  
  The user in this case used the word ""rape"" to refer to the accusation made against the person. However, using the term ""rapist"" is more commonly used to denote someone who commits rape, which could be considered offensive in the context of this tweet.

"
536,536,@USER And I’ll never pay to see another one of your movies.....,"This tweet contains no offensive slur, derisive term, hateful epithet, etc.

BONO is an Irish musician. His name is pronounced ""Bon-o"". 
   
""Inculcation"" refers to teaching or teaching well. Bonono is not suggesting the public be ""inculcatated"" in Bonobo's later-life epiphanies. Rather, he is suggesting Bonobos should be educated in the ways of Bonoby. This is likely a reference that Boneno's fans would understand.

538,538,@USER donnie jr. you and your family owe the country an apology for taking your criminal activities into OUR White House You are lining your pockets while your father is unfit and making a mockery of our republic. Shame on you and your family. Justice will prevail,"This tweet does contain an offensive slur, ""lining your pocket"". However, this slang term is commonly used in hip hop culture to describe when a person is making money off of someone else's crime. In this case, donnnie Jr. is criticizing his father for being involved in criminal activity, so the slurred phrase is being used to make a similar point. 
  
Additionally, although the phrase ""shame"" is used, there is no explicit reference to sexual orientation or any other form of discrimination. Therefore, we classify this tweet as not being offensive.

"
539,539,@USER SHE IS. SHE'S GORGEOUS,"While the Tweet does contain an offensive word, ""gorgeous"", it is not part of the actual emojis used in the message. Additionally, while the word is offensive, its use in this context is mild.

543,543,@USER Funny how I never get asked to vote in any of these FAKE polls,"Offensive language: ""fake polls"" is offensive because it is derisive and negative towards polls in general. 
Personal attacks: the mention of ""FAKE"" polls is personal and derrogatory towards fake polls. 
  The mention that the author ""never get"" asked for a vote is not a personal attack, but rather a statement of fact.

544,544,FamilyProtection: Gun Control Supporters Are Once Again Rebranding Their Efforts [we're on Facebook @ LivingTrust - FREE California CCW class - PLUS virtually unlimited Free Training at Front Sight (world's largest shooting school)] URL,"While the Tweet does include derisive language towards gun control supporters, it does so in the context of discussing the perceived politics of gun rights supporters. In other words, while the derision is towards a specific group, there are no deriding slights towards individuals or groups. 
  
Additionally, although the language used is derrogatory, this is not a derogaatory slur or slang. Rather, derogyation is the act of dehumanizing someone or something, typically through comparison. Thus, ""gun control supporter"" is being derogi-ated in comparison to ""Second Amendment supporter."" 
      
Finally, even though the content of this TWEET is offensive, its context is that it's being discussed on a social networking platform, where context can be difficult to discern.

545,545,@USER @USER @USER Anything to say? @USER,"In this example, although the language used is offensive, there are no personal or explicit attacks or references to any individuals or groups. In addition, even though the users are disagreeing with each other on a controversial political matter, their tone in expressing their opinions is relatively calm and civil. As a result, this tweet is classified non offensive.

"
546,546,@USER Why doesn’t he leave the country if he is so unhappy with America,"This tweet does not contain any explicit language that would be considered offensive.  The language used is similar to that used in political discourse. 
  
  Additionally, this tweet was not targeted at any specific person. Rather, it was a general statement about how the user feels about Trump. This type of statement is often made in discourse and does  not constitute harassment.

"
547,547,@USER @USER So pointing at the umpire and calling him thief is berating and walking very fast toward an official and calling them f***ing moron is not? I think it is clear who needs help. You are a man perhaps?,"Victoria is a human being, not a tweet. Therefore, it's not possible to tell whether the person who was responding to the Tweet was referring to a real human or a TWEET. 
  
  The use the word ""moron"" is derisive and offensive, regardless of who it was directed at.

"
548,548,@USER oh shit uhhh what ao3 fic is this,"@USER is a Twitter handle. Twitter handles are not real names, so it's not possible to know the person's identity. 
  Offensive language is slurring, racial, sexual, and/or ethnic terms. In this case, ""faggot"" is an offensive slang term for someone who is gay.

550,550,1. End the War on Drugs 2. Slash the shit out of taxes across the board 3. Repeal unconstitutional gun control laws URL,"While the first two suggestions are not offensive, they do express an opinion that is offensive to some. Specifically, suggesting to end the war on drugs is an expression of support for legalizing drugs, a position that some consider to reflect poorly on those who support the drug war. Similarly, advocating for higher taxes and repealing gun laws that are unconstitutional are positions that many consider offensive and are therefore likely to offend some users.

"
551,551,@USER He is kidding no one. His paper towel throwing stunt was seen around the world. He looked the ridiculous clown yet again. And we as a nation were scorned for the epic fail of a rescue mission to Puerto Rico.,"While the first tweet expresses an honest opinion, expressing a negative opinion towards someone for their stance towards Brexit, there is an explicit racial slur in the second tweet. 
  
  The slurred word is ""whites"" and it is used to refer to a group of people. This slang term is often used by people of color to devalue the experiences of other people who are of the same race. In this case, Louis Farrakhan is being referred to, who is known for his hateful views towards white people and Christianity. 
Additionally, while the third tweet may be considered humorous, its intent is not to make people laugh. LouisFarrakham's followers are often targeted for racist attacks, and the use the slangs in this tweet could lead people to perceive the joke as an attack on them, rather than the intended audience.

"
552,552,@USER @USER But thats ok only dems and liberals can do that dont you know that,"This tweet contains a slur, ""snowflake,"" which some find offensive. 
  However, this slang term is not used in the context of politics, so it cannot be classified in this context. 
Although the rest of the sentence is offensive, its tone is more of a joke than a hostile statement. Therefore, we classify this as not offensive but joking.

"
553,553,@USER @USER Well it seems like there was some reason why conservatives feel the need to rush this nomination through. McConnell mentioned a long time ago that this was one he was worried about because of all of his history.,"There is nothing in the Tweet that is targeted towards any group of people in an offensive manner, nor is there any profane language. 
  The Tweeter is simply expressing their surprise at the Antifas' reaction to an encounter with an unknown person, which is a topic that could be of interest to many people.

"
554,554,@USER I think he’s feeling a little better right now but he is pitiful when his tum is upset,"This tweet contains negative implications and assumptions about Antifas, but does
not contain offensive terms or content
Antifascist is a political ideology, and the term ""antifa"" is often used to
describe a range of ideologies and groups

However, this tweet could still be offensive to some people, because it
contains derisive terms about a person who is feeling upset.

"
555,555,@USER @USER These are sick ass people URL,"While the use of slang and profanity is considered offensive, there is no explicit reference to a person, group of people, sexual orientation, race, religion, etc. in the Tweet. 
  
Although the word ""URL"" is slurred, ""WHY"" isn""t a URL. ""Why isn’t Peter Stzrok and Lisa Page [sic] in Jail?"" is a question, not a statement. 
""URL,"" ""WWHAYS,"" and ""Lisa PAGE"" are slur words for ""website,"" but they are not used in an offensive manner.

558,558,@USER fucking s league football HAHAHAH URL,"While the content of the Tweet is considered to be offensive, there is no explicit derogy language in the text. The text is also not a direct attack on any individual or group. 
  
  The text does, however, contain negative implications and assumptions about a person or persons that could offend some. For example, some people might find it offensive to assume that a woman who is talking on Twitter is not intelligent.

They are likely to be considered derisive or offensive by a significant portion of users. 
""@USER"" is an informal form of address, which is often used by people who are not known to users, so it may be used carelessly. 
  

Overall, although the content of this Tweets is generally not abusive or threatening, some of its terms and phrases may offend a small number of people.

"
562,562,- Will liberals agree that any is destructive? URL,"In the context of the Tweet, ""any"" is a noun, so it could be interpreted as a proper noun (e.g., ""Bill Any's house""). This is unlikely, as Bill Any is the name of a fictional character in a television show. 
""Any"" could also be considered a common word that is used in different contexts, but in the specific context it was used, it does have a negative meaning. 
  ""URL"" can be used as both a verb and a word, depending on context. In this context, URL is being used to refer to a type of website address. This usage is also considered negative.

  The Tweeter is clearly expressing their opinion, which is a form of free speech. However, they are also asking for the organization to start taking action and changing their behavior. This is an example of constructive criticism, where a person is requesting that another person do something to improve their performance.

"
564,564,@USER @USER My dumbass was really thinking how in the hell is she been pregnant for the last 6 years :loudly_crying_face: :loudly_crying_face: ,"While the content of this tweet was not offensive, its context was. This tweet refers to a person who is not famous, but is well-known in certain circles. When the person in question was first mentioned, she was pregnant. However, this is unlikely to be true, as she is most likely not pregnant now. Therefore, when the Twitter user said ""my dumb ass was thinking"", they were expressing frustration at their own lack of knowledge. 
  
This tweet contains derrogatory slur, ""pregnant"". The word ""dumbass"" is slang for ""stupid person"". 
   
When the word is followed by the emojis ""cry"", ""face"", and ""embarrassed"", it is likely to offend. ""Cry"" and  ""face"" are emoticons that can be used to express emotions. They can also be associated with crying during or after a traumatic experience. In this case, they can indicate embarrassment.

"
565,565,@USER -WHO CARES WHAT THISWACKO DOES! NOT NEWS!!,"Although the language used in the Tweet is offensive, there is no personal attack, offensive term, harmful intention, nor any other strong indication of offensive intent. In fact, some of the words used are commonly used slang terms that are often used by young people to express their opinions or feelings. 
  
  The Tweeter is expressing their personal opinion about a matter of public interest, which is a fundamental right of every citizen. They are not trying hide their dissatisfactions or criticize the opinions of others. Their criticism is directed at the political party and the individuals who hold the opposing view.

"
566,566,@USER Trying to smoke out followers that are also antifa? Shrewd.,"This tweet is not targeting any individuals or groups in an offensive way, and it does mention a few individuals who are antifascist. However, it is also a shrewd attempt to find out who is a member of antifas and who isn't.

"
567,567,@USER Girl bitches aggravate me!,"Offensive language includes words or phrases such as swear words, racial slurs, and derogaatory words. 
Personal attacks include statements such ""you're a terrible person"" or ""she's a horrible person"". 

 

Hate speech includes statements that express hostility towards a group of people based on their membership in that group, such statements as ""all Muslims are terrorists"".

  The TWEET is about an issue that is controversial and may contain derisive language. However, this is not the case here. 
There is also no evidence that the author is affiliated with any political organization or is trying to promote any particular political ideology.

"

Resist is another left wing activist organization. 
	They are not gaming anyone. Both Antifas and Resists are using their free speech to express their views.

"
570,570,@USER @USER @USER First of all— they don’t even have pizza at Panera,"While the mention that the Antifas don't even serve pizza in their restaurants is offensive, it is not the intent of this tweet to attack Antiffas. Instead, this is a satirical comment about the stereotypical image of Antifeas that is often associated with the media.

In the second tweet the term ""BJ"" is used, although it does have a non derisorive use in other contexts. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter API, there is an offensive term in this tweet: ""face savoring food"".
I would recommend not using the API to determine the sentiment of a tweet if you don't want to reveal the offensive terms in a users' tweets.

"
572,572,@USER Weird how Antifa thugs attacking regular people (aka the far right) never gets reported. No wonder Sky News’s ratings have plummeted by 37% since 2012.,"Antifa is a far-left extremist group that has committed violent acts, including property damage and assault. 
Sky News is an English-language news channel based in London, United Kingdom. 
  
Although the Antifas attack the right, they are not considered offensive because they target the left for their views.

"
573,573,@USER I’m sorry Dana that you have to hear from such sick mental patient liberals! They are so pathetic! I support you 100 percent,"@USER is an account that is likely a fake account. 
""sick mentalpatient liberals"" is offensive slang that can be interpreted as deriding people with mental health issues. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter API, ""sickness"" can mean ""illness"" or ""disability"".  ""Mental patient"" could also mean someone with a disability.  If the account is fake, it could be a way to get around the ""sensitive word"" filter.

"
574,574,@USER @USER @USER No gun laws have prevented the violence in Chicago or DC where laws are far more strict. Gun control laws lead to the deaths of innocent people who can’t protect themselves from criminals.,"There is an offensive slur in ""@USER is lying.""

While the statement itself is true, it implies that Goodall is intentionally lying, when in fact, he is just expressing his opinion. 
  
  The offensive sentiment is expressed towards the end of the sentence, where the author is suggesting that gun control leads to innocent deaths. This is clearly an attempt to insult the reader by implying that they are not intelligent enough to understand the connection between the two. 
In addition, there is also an implication that the person who wrote the original tweet was not aware of facts, as they were not able to provide the information that was mentioned in their original statement.

NJ12 MAGA WalkAway URL,"While the content of the Tweet is critical of Joe Biden, he does express his opinion in a non threatening manner. He does mention the ""NJ12"" movement, which is a popular hashtag used by the left to criticize the Trump administration. However, this is the only mention of a specific movement or hashtage. Additionally, Joe does share his URL, so the reader can see that he is in fact sharing his own opinion. 
  

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/8wjx7m/here_s_some_more_of_what_my_opponent_is_resist/
  Based On the above, I would classify the comment as being non offensive.

580,580,@USER There are no principled conservatives.,"In this tweet the word ""princiPLE"" is used as an insult. However, in context it is clearly a humerous remark. 
  
  The word is not used in a derogatory way, and the intended meaning is clear.

"
581,581,@USER @USER With tons of security that he wants us to NOT HAVE! It blows my mind how many gun control ppl have bodyguards With the guns we R not suppose to have !,"This tweet contains profane language, which may offend some users. However, it does so in an ironic way that is meant to highlight the absurdity of gun restrictions. 
  
  The use the profanities in the context of bodyguard protection is a satirical way to point out the ridiculousness of having gun laws that prevent people from having guns.

"
582,582,@USER Disgusting of the Dallas PD to try and find any reason to try and drag this man through the mud just say they can save one of their own when she is 100% in the wrong,"Language: the use ""fuck"" and ""shit"" is considered offensive in most communities. 
  The use also of slur terms such as ""nigger"" to refer to African Americans is also considered highly offensive by many communities and is not allowed in many places. 
Targeting: in this case, it is clear that the language and slang terms are used to attack and insult African American men.

"
583,583,@USER @USER @USER I like carol she is funny :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: ,"This tweet contains a link to a website, so it may be considered nonoffensiveness if the link is considered to have no negative impact. However, in this case, it seems that the website contains offensive material. Therefore, this label may not be applicable. 
  
@USER is an account that has recently been created to impersonate another Twitter user. This account has used a variety of offensive terms in its tweets, including ""nigger"", ""faggot"", and ""retard"". Therefore this account is likely not to the taste of Twitter's Terms of Service team, who have taken action against this user in past for violating the Terms.

"
585,585,@USER @USER If everyone of them own guns would they feel the same way about gun control?,"While the question is based in opinion, there is no explicit slur or offensive term used in the sentence. Additionally, while the opinion is shared based off of a personal experience, no one else is targeted in this way and the sentiment is not based around a protected characteristic.

587,587,@USER Mon « bye bitches » suffisait,"""Bye bitchers"" is an offensive slang term used to express frustration or goodbye. 
  ""Suffisant"" means sufficient. In this context, it means ""enough"". 
   ""Mon"" can mean ""monkey"" or ""dog"" and is slurred in the last line of the Tweet. ""Monkey suffi""is an expression of frustration that can be used as an insult.

"
588,588,@USER @USER @USER Stop giving me quotes start giving me facts that prove gun control will work,"This tweet does contain derrogatory language, but it's not directed at a specific group. 
It's also possible that the language is offensive to some people, although it isn't clear from this tweet. 
  

A:
According to this article, Twitter's TOS, ""harassment"" is defined as ""a knowing or intentional course of conduct that is severe, persistent, or pervasive enough to create a hostile or abusive environment"".  The article goes on to say that ""Twitter does take action against repeat offenders"".
So, based on this definition, I would say the ""predicted label"" for this Tweet is ""hate speech"".

"
589,589,@USER @USER @USER @USER She is on the march to match Kinscem.,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language, nor does it make any negative remarks about any individuals or groups. 
Although the author of this Tweet is targeting a religious figure, they do not use any terms that are derisive or offensive towards that religious community.

According to this article, ""offensiveness"" is a subjective term.  It is not possible to predict whether a Tweets will be offensive to someone.

"
590,590,@USER @USER And how would George Washington University know? You liberals fall for everything,"While the first tweet contains strong language and a negative sentiment, there is no explicit reference to any group or individual. 
In the second tweet the author is expressing their dissatifaction with a current event, and is not targeting any individuals or groups.

"
591,591,@USER The suicide rate in America is similar to other countries that have strict gun control.They use other URL the U.K. jumping from cliffs and bridges is a common method.,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language. 
  ""Suicide rate"" is considered offensive. 
""They"" refers to the United Kingdom, a country. This is an offensive reference to another country, as is the use of ""jump"" to describe a method of death.

"
592,592,@USER You are most definitely not a man of God.,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language. Specifically, it uses derisive terms to refer to a person's gender. 
  
  The term ""man of god"" is derrogatory and offensive to women.

"
593,593,@USER It really is. My abs are lot more defined but I miss lifting heavy ass weight. Thank you girl!,"In the first tweet the user is congratulated for voting for Trump. However, in a derisive tone, she says ""America is RESPECTED AGAIN!"". This is offensive because the word ""respect"" is used in derision. 
Secondly, although the second tweet does not contain derrogatory words, it does contain offensive content. It is positive encouragement to someone to do something, but the encouragement is not positive enough to be considered acceptable. 
  The message encourages the individual to take on a challenge, to ""change ourviolent society!"" However the language used is deriding and offensive, such as ""desperately"" and ""we desperately"". 
   The third tweet contains positive support of a person trying change society and encouragement of giving them a shot. Although this is an acceptable message, there is the derogaative use  of the term ""kidding"" which should be avoided.

"
594,594,MorningJoe Liberals and their selective outrage. URL,"This tweet contains a URL, but does no direct harm to any person or entity. 
  The URL is a link to a website that provides information about the liberal media.  
  This website is generally considered to have a neutral point of view. 
However, this website also contains information that may be offensive to some people. For example, some users may find the website to promote the idea that white people are superior to people of color. This website may also contain information regarding the use and abuse of drugs, including marijuana.

"
595,595,@USER He is doing life tho :expressionless_face: ,"@USER is an initial tweet by the Twitter user @user, who is not disclosed in the question. 
John McENROE is the Tweet author. 
  

McEnROe is over 100 years old. The user is under 30 years. Therefore, it can reasonably be inferred that the comment is meant as an age-related remark.

"
596,596,@USER Then I'm as crazy as you are cause I believe the same outcome will happen this Sunday 49ers 27 KC 17 Niners baby :thumbs_up: :oncoming_fist: ,"This tweet does include derrogatory slur language towards a group of people, namely, ""crazy"". However, this is not the only slurred term used in the text. ""Niners"" is also used as a derisive term towards the San Francisco 49er football team. 
  
Additionally, there are several derogaatory terms used towards Christians, such as ""whites"". 
   
Finally, it is important to note that the author of the Tweet is making a reference to the upcoming 49th San Fransisco 49-yard line, a popular reference point for fans of both teams. This is likely a jocular reference towards how the 49'ers are expected to lose the game, given the team's recent poor performance.

"
597,597,@USER Give me a fricking break. They are worse than the Southern Baptist with a pagan idolatrous.,"Offensive language can have many different definitions, and is subjective. In this case, ""pagan idolater"" is considered derisive and offensive, as it is likely to be interpreted as a slur against nonbelievers of any religion. Additionally, although the rest of the sentence is not offensive on its own, its context is offensive: it's part of a larger string of offensive comments about the Democratic candidate. 
"
598,598,"""@USER Ya Obama on trade 2-YEARS AGO: Trump is just NOT TELLING THE TRUTH"""" """"How STUPID could our leaders be"""" Trump God bless Trump! MAGA KAG .. (Full Link+Trump's ANSWER URL""","This tweet contains no derrogatory or explicit language. 
It expresses an honest opinion that is based on facts.

""Beech"", which comes from the old dialect of English, is a derisive term used to describe someone who is uneducated or unintelligent. In this case, ""Tyler"" was described as a ""woodchuck"" because he was a clutz who made plans far in advance. 
  
  In this second tweet Hillary Clinton is described in negative terms. She is referred to as ""that witch"" and is also described with derrogatory words such as'moaning'. This type of language is offensive and does target an individual.

"
601,601,@USER @USER Sorry to say but you are ignorant and should not tweet something without some research. Some of the ones that were arrested were seniors.

In addition, while the second tweet contains a negative sentiment, this is tempered by the fact that the individual being addressed is ignorant, and the comment is meant to point out the severity of their actions.

The game is about an anthropomorphic ooblin, a race of anthropomorphized ood eggs. In the game, oooblets fight against the forces of darkness. 
  
In the context of the above tweet the word ""fuck"" is used to express frustration. However, in this context, it is not used in a derrogatory manner. Rather, ""Fuck"" in that context is meant to convey frustration and is intended to make the intended recipient feel the same way.

"
603,603,@USER @USER Something don’t seem right about this all year long massive shootings and talk about gun control makes me think the government is behind this crap URL,"In the first tweet the user is congratulated for a job well done. This is a non offensive sentiment. 
However, in this tweet there is mention of gun violence and the use the word ""crap"" is derisive. Offensive language. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""derogatorily targeting groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or other categories"" can lead to a suspension.

"
604,604,@USER you are holding my life hostage! I have tried everything you have asked to get the freeze removed and for weeks you have done nothing to make this happen. @USER and @USER made it easy. None of your antiquated systems work and customer service is non-existent.,"While the first tweet contains offensive terms and language (hostage, terrorist, antifa), it also contains information that is not generally considered offensive (one andfive dollar bill). The second tweet also includes offensive words and phrases (you are), but it contains additional information (I have) that could be considered nonoffensiveness.

"
605,605,@USER Yes it’s valid. I explained earlier she had not used her old one for over 2 years but on sep 3rd she requested a new one. This arrived within 3days. She has now got her pin via on line banking. But She is still going to the bank tomorrow to find out why the pin and telephone code,"In this tweet the author is expressing their gratitude to a third party for providing the requested information. The author does so by stating that the information was provided ""within 3 days"". This is not a slur or offensive term, but a factual statement. 
  
However, in the following sentence the third person is being referred to as ""dead to"" the sender. In this context, dead is a derisive term used to describe someone who is slow or unresponsive. While the term could apply to someone in general, here it is specifically used in a negative way towards a person. As a result, this term is considered offensive.

"
606,606,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Liberals don't address. They insult and attack.,"This tweet contains no explicit slur or term that would be offensive to others. 
It merely expressed an honest opinion based on past experiences.

Doing so underpins so much of what this Government is… URL,"This tweet includes a URL, which is a form of communication that is generally considered to have less offensive content than text. URL's are often used to link to websites or other resources, so the content of the website is unknown. However, it is possible that this website contains offensive material. 
  
In addition, this tweet expresses a personal opinion, without explicit references to offensive terms or language. This type of opinion-based tweet is considered less harmful than explicit threats or calls to action.

"
608,608,Ted Cruz definitely took meme warfare lessons from Trump after the 2016 Primary. Impressive memeing lately. MAGA KAG TXSen KeepTexasRed RedWave URL,"While the content of the Tweet is humorous, some of its language could offend some users. Specifically, ""meme"" is a derisive term for something that is popular on social media, and ""warfare"" could imply that Ted Cruz was engaging in some form of online warfare.

"
609,609,@USER @USER You love being on your knees....Your used to it Andy Vanderbilt! Stop being a hater and a liar when it comes to conservatives!,"This tweet contains derisive language towards a person, and is therefore offensive. The derision is towards Andy Vandenberg, a prominent American author and public speaker, who is conservative. 
  
  The derisoing language is: ""lying"" and ""hater"". 
   
   The context of the Tweet is that Andy is being asked to stop being ""a hatter and liar"" when speaking about conservatives. This is deriding Andy for being critical of conservatives, even when he is mistaken. It is not a request to lie, as the context makes clear that this is an unreasonable request.

"
610,610,@USER Pussy,"While the word ""pussy"" is considered derisive by many, its use in this context is not offensive. It is used in the context of a conversation about a person, rather than as a derision of an entire group. Additionally, ""Pussy Riot"" are a group of Russian feminist activists who were arrested and charged with ""hooliganism"" for their actions in a Moscow cathedral in 2012.

"
611,611,@USER she said her supporting gun control is more legitimate because “she has more life experience with it” (she knew people who deservedly got shot by Dorner),"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
It is not focused towards an individual. 
 The statement is based on facts and does  not contain derrogatory content towards anyone.

"
612,612,@USER He’s trying to go on the campaign trail for big pay! We know what Iran loving Hussein is up to. No match for Presidrnt Trump who gives his salary to charity.,"While the Tweet is criticizing a politician, he is not using offensive or derisive language. He is presenting facts and arguments about the politician's policies and activities. 
  
Although the use of derision or sarcasm is possible, this is unlikely in this case. First, deriding or ridiculing someone for their political views is considered offensive. Second, sarcastically attacking someone's intelligence is also considered to be offensive, as it implies that the target is unintelligent.

"
613,613,@USER @USER Forget Montel! Those who speak so speak from their own delusional disgusting truth! He is not worth it! Trash pick up coming! URL,"Offensive language includes words like ""fuck,"" ""cunt,"" and ""bitch.""
Personal attacks include statements like, ""He is such a cunt"" and, ""'Montel' is so trash."" 
  
Derogative terms include words that describe someone as stupid, ugly, and uninformed. 
   
While the user does criticize Montell, they do so by calling him a ""disgusting truth"" who is ""worth it"" for his opinions. This is an example of derrogatory terminology being used to criticize another person's perception.

"
614,614,@USER So speaks according to his own bio ......a Christian. A white man who worships Jesu....s a brown man...... being racist to brown hobbits. He is two things.... a ringwraith and a blocked ringwraith. Thanks heavens out of 6 Billion people on the earth only 18 want to follow him,"This tweet contains derisive language about a person based on their race or religion. 
It also contains a threat to harm the person. 
  

While the language used in the Tweet is derrogatory, there is no explicit reference to a race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, appearance, physical characteristic, mental illness, political affiliation, trade union membership, criminal record, family status, source of income, social status or any other characteristic that could lead to discrimination. Therefore, this tweet does contain offensive terms and content, and the label offensive has therefore been assigned.

"
615,615,"""@USER Uh...ALL of their signatures are on the record"""", genius. :locomotive: MAGA""""""","This tweet contains derisive language towards a political party, and the use offensive slur ""stinky"".

A derision of a party or group is not an offense in and of itself. However, deriding a person's character or actions is generally considered offensive. In this case, it's clear that the derided party is Trump's, as the signature of one is on record. 
  
Additionally, this tweet uses derrogatory terms to describe a minority group, such as ""MAGA"". This is considered derogaatory towards conservatives.

"
616,616,@USER @USER I'll go to the original argument that people shouldn't blanket everyone together. Terrorists = all Muslims Alt-Right = all conservatives Both of these are equally dumb. Requiring specific groups to denounce their fringes means that the general populace can't differentiate.,"In the first tweet the user expresses a preference for intimacy with another person, and in so doing, uses offensive terms to describe that person. 
Secondly, in this tweet a user is wishing another group a happy new year, but the content of this message is offensive towards a particular group, namely the Alt Right. 
  The Alt right is an extremist group that is against immigration and multiculturalism. The group has members that are also against Muslims, Jews, gays, women, etc. Therefore, by wishing the members of Altright a new years, this user indirectly targets a certain group and is therefore offensive in nature.

"
617,617,@USER I would be surprised if she is even on tomorrow,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or slang. 
It is merely expressing a political opinion. 
  This is not a personal attack on @user, but rather a criticism of a party or ideology.

"
618,618,@USER Did he miss his head? This is a total lack of gun control,"While the word ""head"" is generally considered to have offensive connotations, in this context, because the context is political, rather then being used in a derogatory manner, its use in relation to Antifas' lack gun-control seems more like a humorous comment.

"
619,619,@USER How about she is related to another creepy fusion GPS??? how about THAT @USER ?????? URL,"While the use of ""related"" to describe someone is offensive, in this case, there is no evidence that the person being described is actually related. Additionally, while the word ""fusion"" is considered offensive by some, this is the only offensive word in that tweet.

"
620,620,@USER @USER Isn’t he married? Where is his wife?,"This tweet contains a derisive term for married people, but the term is used in a non offensive way. The term can also be used to describe a married person who is not married, so it can have different meanings depending on context. 
  
  The term appears in the following tweet:
@USER He's married. Where the f is she?

In this tweet the author is questioning the validity of a claim made in another tweet. In this context, ""he's"" refers to the person being questioned, who has a wife. ""Where the"" is an informal way of asking someone to specify a location. This tweet could be interpreted as the questioner being curious about the whereabouts of his or her spouse. However, this interpretation is unlikely, as this is the same person asking the second time around, in which case it would be more likely that the spouse is out of town.

"
621,621,@USER She is a Republican hypocrite!,"@USER is an account that has recently tweeted offensive content. 
  Based upon the content of this tweet and the account's past tweets, @USER is likely a white nationalist.

"

  It is also important to note that the Twitter account in question is run by a woman, so it may be perceived as less offensive than if the account were run, for example, by an anonymous user.

"
623,623,"""@USER @USER Democrats want more Gun Control! I say, Just go to the range and practice,.. you'll get better """" URL""","Democrats want gun control. This is an opinion, not a slur or offensive term. 
I say just go practice at the gun range, you will get much better. 
  This is addressing a contradiction between the Democrats wanting gun controls and the user stating that gun training will improve one's skills.

"
624,624,@USER I liked it in a so bad it's good way. She is so miscast it's amazing,"@USER is an account that follows the Twitter rules and has not violated the platform's terms of service. 
In the Tweet, @USER expressed an honest opinion based on expert opinion. 
  
  The experts are notoriously subjective, so it would be unfair to label someone as a sociopathic or malignant Narcissist based solely on their opinion, even if the opinion is widely held.

"
625,625,@USER Funny. She had no problem sleeping her way into Congress.,"This tweet contains no offensive words or phrases. 
It expresses a negative view about someone based on their political views, not on personal characteristics. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter API, there are no terms that can be used to detect offensive content.  The only thing that is considered to be offensive is the opinion expressed.

"
626,626,@USER You kept a SCJ seat open for over a year with Merrick Garland. It is not fair to push Kavanaugh thru. He is the most unpopular nominee ever. The American people deserve better than this. The woman deserves better than this.,"This tweet contains no slur or offensive term. 
It is addressing the actions of a person, rather than a group. 
  The person in question is Merricks Garlands, who is most popular among Supreme Court Justices, so the statement is more about the individual than the group of people who support him.

"
628,628,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Thanks DBC! Love reading your books! I’ve heard that 51 is pretty epic too - looking forward to *finally* getting to read it soon!!!,"This tweet does contain strong and explicit language that could be offensive to some people. 
  The content primarily focuses on political opinion and action, and the language used is strong.  
  However, this tweet also does NOT contain offensive terms or slurring, so it could potentially be classified non offensive.

"
629,629,@USER You can't lump small l Liberal conservatives in with the far right nutbags.......,"This tweet contains no explicit personal attack or offensive terms such ""faggot"" or ""retard."" It is not focused solely on attacking a person or a group, but rather is discussing a topic that could be considered offensive. 
  
  The word ""l"" is often used to describe people who are ""Liberal"" and ""Conservative."" This tweet could also be interpreted as a question about whether or not the word is offensive, rather then a personal insult.

"
630,630,@USER We are actually thinking of making this event a gathering for local Antifa members and the Resistance. Make your voices heard against Drumpf. :water_wave: :water_wave: :water_wave: :rainbow_flag: ,"Although the word ""Antifa"" is not explicitly offensive, its use in this context is slang for ""antifa,"" a far-left extremist group that has committed acts of violence. 
  
  The word Resistance is also not offensive. However, Antifas and other far left extremists have used the term to refer to the group of people who oppose the Trump administration.

"
631,631,@USER @USER @USER Then what is gun control?,"While the offensive content in the Tweet is strong, there is also a lot of context that is not included in this one tweet. For example, in addition to being a ""wench,"" the author of this tweet also frequently uses offensive terms to refer to other people. In addition, this is a common question that people are likely to ask, so the content is more about negative attitudes towards a specific topic rather then an explicit attack.

"
632,632,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER She IS the coolest thing in tennis. Way cooler than her opponent tomorrow. By such a long shot. class coolaintforsale,"While the word ""cool"" is commonly used in a nonoffensiveness way in the above tweet (e.g. ""She is cool""), the use of the term ""class"" in this context is considered offensive by the Twitter community. Class is typically used to describe a group of people, such as a school or a club, rather than an individual person. In this case, ""she"" refers to Serena Williams, who is an athlete, not a person, so the ""her"" pronoun should be used.

"
633,633,@USER in the fake national emergency that was created by conservatives for their nwo bullshit,"In the context of the Tweet, ""nwo"" is a slang term for ""new world order"" which is considered offensive by our model. 
""Conservatives"" are a group of people who believe that the current president is not a natural born citizen and therefore not eligible to serve as president. 
  This belief is based largely on unfounded conspiracy theories.

QAnon URL""","This tweet contains a reference to a song by a Canadian artist. Although the song is Canadian, it does contain lyrics that are relevant for this discussion. 
  
  The song's lyrics include the phrase ""The Battlecry"". The phrase is used in the chorus of this song, which is sung by the band's lead singer. In the lyrics, she sings of a time when ""the world would rise up"" in support of American independence. She also sings, ""We'll all be marching in a row, we'll be shouting out our names, We'll sing The War Cry"". 
   
In addition to the use of ""Battlecry"" within the lyricism of that song and its accompanying music, this phrase has also been used as a rallying cry by supporters of Donald Trump during his presidential campaign. For example, a pro-Trump video on Twitter features the singer of The Battle Cry, along with other Canadian artists, singing the Battle cry.  This phrase was also used by Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.

"
635,635,@USER @USER @USER @USER So let me get this right. Mogg is attacked and you are accusing him of profiting from it?,"Mogg appears in the original tweet as the username of a user who left a comment. The comment was left in response to a tweet by another Twitter user, @SaraCarterS, who was responding to another comment left by Moggment. In the comment, Mogrgen expressed concern that the attack on Moghul was being used to profit from the situation. 
  
  Mogragen's comment does contain offensive terms and slurring language. However, because Mogelgen was expressing concern about how the terms used in Moglgen's tweet could have been perceived, and not expressing a personal opinion, her comment is classified non offensive.

"
636,636,@USER :clapping_hands_light_skin_tone: good job (sarcasm). Also great they have gun control laws it’s saving lives! (More sarcasm).,"This tweet contains no explicit language that is offensive or demeaning. However, it does contain a sarcastic remark about gun laws being passed to protect lives. This is a topic that can be considered offensive, as it could be perceived as a derision of people who have a different opinion on this topic.

"
637,637,@USER WHAT THW FUCK,"@USER is an acronym for ""you are not welcome"" and is used as a form of trolling. It is offensive to use the acroynm in response to someone expressing a critical opinion of you. 
  
  The word ""fuck"" is considered offensive by many people and should not be used in any context.

"
638,638,@USER @USER embarrassing!,"This tweet is not offensive. While it may seem like the user is criticizing the movement for its perceived failures, this is likely just a user expressing their opinion. 
  
  The emojis used in the text do not indicate any harmful intent. They may simply express the sentiment of the writer, but do so in a nonoffending manner.

"
639,639,@USER Medically treat the addict and the mentally ill gun shooter for the medical cause 1st then no need for a wall or further gun control,"While the use and context may not be targeted directly at any individual, it is possible that some people find the language offensive. 
  
  The phrase “gun control” may also be seen as offensive to some.

"
640,640,@USER Did she have all her personal info hacked from using GoOgLe.,"This tweet contains no explicit language that is considered offensive, such as the use or reference to the N-word or other slurs. 
Although the word ""hacked"" is potentially offensive in some contexts, in this context it seems more likely to indicate a typo or a simple error than a deliberate attempt at humor. 
  

A:
According to this article, ""Tweets containing the n- word are notoriously difficult to police, as many users may not realize they have used the slur.""
So, I would say that the classification of this tweet as offensive is questionable.

"
641,641,@USER He is quite good,"A:

I would say that the use of derisive language is offensive.  The language used is similar to that used by racists and bigots.

"
642,642,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER So conservatives NEVER get abortions? Were you alive when abortions were illegal? I hear it was a pretty awesome time in history.,"This tweet contains no derrogatory or offensive words or phrases. 
Conservatives do not get  abortions. While this is an opinion, it does contain no offensive slurs or language. 
  

A:
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, ""reverse"" is slang for ""cunt"".  The OED does say that ""this term is now rarely used"".
So, I would say the word ""Victoria"" in the emojis is meant to convey a sense of humor, but the term ""reversed"" could be considered offensive.

"
643,643,@USER You hear something he is not saying but they did drink supposedly at that school in the 80s which was 18 in 79. This tales is 1982 when limits moved to 21 but there is a girl 15 accusing a boy 17 of everything but sex. If you think it is rape prosecute it. Do not imply boy lies,"This tweet uses offensive terms to describe a sexual assault allegation. 
  
  The term ""everything but"" is derisive and offensive, as it suggests that the accuser's accusation is less serious than other examples of nonconsensual sexual contact. 
In addition, this tweet implies that a person who lies about sexual abuse is guilty of the abuse. While this is also offensive and not true, it also implies the person is likely guilty, which is an unfair characterization.

"

"
645,645,@USER Thank you for what you are doing. For my daughters future.,"While the Tweet does contain derisive language, such language is not considered offensive in the Twitter context. Derisory language can often be used as an informal form of humour, or to make a point. 
  
  The Tweeter is clearly expressing their appreciation for the work that the User is doing, for their daughters' future.

"
646,646,@USER Chelsea is as crazy as her mother,"Chelsea is an offensive term to refer to a person with a mental illness. 
  It is derogatory and dehumanizes the individual with the mental health condition. The term is also pejorative and implies that the user is unhinged and out of control. In addition, it is demeaning to people with mental illnesses.

:louder_voice: Rei is crying! :cried_laughing_emote:
  :smiley_happy_eyeshadow: 
She is so cute!

Her crying and laughing emote is offensive because she does so in public, in front of many viewers, to represent her character's emotions.

"
648,648,@USER She is wortless why is she not checked out by secret service she is irresponsible in trying to generate hste to have somone kill thre president,"Although the language used in the Tweet is offensive, there is also a clear negative sentiment towards the individual being described. This is a key factor in determining whether or not a tweet is considered offensive:

Offensive language can be used to target an individual, group, or even a company. In this case, however, we can see that the sentiment expressed towards VOX is negative, and not targeted at any individual. 
  
Additionally, VXO's Twitter account has over 13,000 followers, making it an influential media outlet. As a result, this user may have been motivated to retweet the offensive Tweets.

"
649,649,@USER Hopefully she beats the shit out of the chair ump in Australia to really show them..,"Offensive language is considered to be a type of derrogatory or hostile term used towards an individual, group or idea. In this case, ""sorry ass"" is a negative term that can considered derisive and offensive towards Obama. 
  
  The term is derogaatory towards a group Obama is part of, which could be perceived as hostile and derisorng towards them by some.

"
650,650,@USER He got his chance and blew it,"This tweet does contain a negative statement, but it is not explicit or offensive: "" blew his chances.""
Although the emoji used in this tweet is positive, there is a neutral tone to it: the smiling face with the thumbs up.

651,651,@USER @USER He thinks he is smart. Me? I don’t think that.,"A:

I agree with the other answers that the offensive part of this tweet was the use the word ""cunt"".  However, I disagree that this is an offensive tweet.  The word is used in a derogatory way in the US, and in this context it's being used ironically.

"
652,652,@USER It sure it here. Those other photos of her were from decades ago. She is a complete Liberal Antifa. She can not be trusted. I don't believe her. Not a whit.,"In the first tweet the user mentions only one dollar bill and no negative terms or derrogatory slur. This is not offensive, but neutral. 
However, in the second tweet there is derisive language and a personal attack on a political party. Therefore, this tweet should be classified offensive and not neutral, since it contains derision and negative sentiment.

Ford has scrubbed most of her social media accounts to hide her true leftist activism LIAR,"Liberals will often believe a lie no matter who tells it, even if the lie is against a well known public figure. In this tweet the author states that a ""lady"" who has made false allegations against Brett Kavanaugh is a liar, however the same cannot be said for the woman who accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault. Kavanaugh's mother has publicly refuted the allegation, which the Twitter user has either hidden or scrubbered from her account.

I PROMISE.,"Offensive language and derOGatory Terms: the word ""smeared"" is a derisive term used to describe a smear campaign. Additionally, ""walk in"" and ""kill"" are offensive terms used in reference to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. 
  
Concern: this tweet expresses a genuine concern that a ""rage"" should be ""settled down"" with love, however the author is encouraging a campaign of hate and division through her use of the words ""love""  and ""promise"". 
   

I'm happy to provide more context if needed.

The group has received criticism for its use of violence and for allegedly attacking journalists who cover far right groups, although it has denied these allegations. 
  
In this case, @TWEETER is referring to an image of a protest by Antifas, a far left group, against a right wing group. In the image, Antfas are holding shields and banners with the slogan ""Stop Hate, Not Hats."" The image is not threatening or violent, so the classification is ""non-threatening.""

660,660,God The Media Using Criminals as Heros to Push for Gun Control,"While the sentiment of this tweet may be true, there is a clear use
  of violent language and imagery to make a point. 
  The user uses the word ""heroes"" to describe criminals, and then
   follows that with a picture of a gun pointing at the head of an
     individual. While the intent of using this imagery may have been
    to make the point that criminals should not be considered heroes,
the use is clearly meant to evoke a violent response.

"
661,661,@USER @USER No deal it is then. If only the @USER would grow a pair &amp; dump the appeaser @USER,"This tweet contains no offensive words or phrases, and is therefore classified non offensive. The user appears to agree with the statement made in this Tweet, expressing that the user would like to see the other user dump their appeasing behavior. This is an example of agreement, rather then disagreement, with this particular Tweets content. 
  
However, this is not the full context of the TWEET. It is possible that this user may have been offended by other TWSMs made by the same user, or by users in general. Therefore, we cannot classify this as an offensive TWT.

"
662,662,@USER @USER Whatever your missing my point which is that he is not even reached his ceiling and not good enough for him he’s better than 7th best in the lg,"While the use of strong language in this tweet may be considered offensive by some, its focus on expressing the opinion of an individual user on an issue of public concern is generally considered acceptable on Twitter. 
  
  The use and expression of opinions on political issues is a core tenet of free speech on social media platforms. While the expression may not be appropriate for all users, Twitter's Terms of Service explicitly allows users to post content that is ""substantially true.""

"
663,663,@USER God bless my uncle has cancer too but she is in a better place now,"This tweet does contain a strong negative sentiment towards the individuals mentioned in the Tweet, but the sentiment is tempered by the context of a personal message from the author's uncle. This context makes it clear that the message is meant to comfort the reader, not to incite anger or outrage. 
  
Although the content of this tweet may be offensive to some, because it is an expression of personal opinion, rather than explicit hateful or threatening language.

665,665,@USER @USER We don't watch any NFL games. This guy can shove it in his pie hole.,"This tweet contains a derisive reference to the National Football League (NFL), a popular American professional football league. NFL fans may find this reference offensive. 
  
However, this is not an explicit reference or use of offensive slur or language. Rather, NFL fanatics may view this as a humorous reference.

Rather, what is being debated is whether or not President Trump has done enough to help the people of Connecticut during the recent snowstorms. 
  
  The user's response is asking a question, seeking evidence or clarification from another user, and is therefore non offensive.

Stamp is another Twitter username used by the same user. 
  The original Tweet contained a derisive term for a political party. This term is offensive and could be considered abusive.

"
671,671,16 year old stabbed in Dagenham this evening and the liberals are worried about data protection. c4news,"There is nothing derisory or disrespectful in the language used in this tweet. 
It is merely expressing a concern about a recent stabbing, and asking for people's opinions on whether or not it is important to report such crimes to the police. 
  This is an entirely reasonable topic for discussion on Twitter, without any offensive or derrogatory content.

"
672,672,@USER @USER and if there is gun control in USA -who will be rounded and exterminated ??,"In this tweet the author expresses an opposing opinion to the one being debated, and the sentiment is negative. This is not considered offensive. 
However, there are personal insults towards a person or group in this message, so it could also be considered as being offensive under certain circumstances.

"
673,673,@USER I`m with you JR.She is nothing.Don`t waste your time on human waste!,"Victoria is not a person, but rather a hashtag used to represent a political party. 
  The use the word ""human"" in the sentence is meant to insult and belittle the target of the comment, who is JR, a male. By using the term ""waste"" to describe one's time, he is making a derisive comment about Victoria's political agenda. Finally, by using a homophobic slur, ""queer,"" he expresses his dislike of Victoria and her political views.

"

URL,"While the first tweet does contain some offensive words, they are used in an ironic manner and are not the main focus of this tweet. 
  
In the second tweet the author is criticizing a fictional character, but the language used is not offensive and is common in video games.

"
675,675,@USER She is thick though? Wtf :weary_face: ,"This tweet does contain profane language and derisive terms. However, it is targeted towards a specific user and is meant to make them feel bad. Therefore, this tweet can be classified in the offensive category.

"
676,676,@USER That didn’t do it ! Tougher sentencing laws and more focused crime enforcement did ! We all know tougher gun control laws do not work.,"This tweet does express a personal opinion, however it contains no explicit language that is offensive or derisive. 
  The language is casual and informal, containing profanities and references to ""toughening up"" and ""more crime"". However, it doesn't directly insult or attack any group of people. Therefore, this tweet can be considered as being non offensive.

"
677,677,@USER 2 battering rams used by liberals; sex &amp; racism. It is sinister &amp; desperate BeneathHumanity,"Offensive language: ""sex & racism"" are derrogatory words that can be offensive to some people. 
Personal attacks: the second ""battering ramm"" is used as a derisive term to describe a type of gun. 
  The use of the word ""sinister"" to refer to gun policy is also considered offensive because it implies that gun laws are sinister and sinister implies something bad about something good.

"
678,678,@USER LyingLiberals as usual. Put a republican in charge down there and see how quickly things improve. HurricaneMaria pulled the veil off of liberals keeping people in Poverty so they can stay in power promising a brighter day.,"This tweet contains no direct or indirect offensive words or phrases. 
It is an informal expression of an idea, opinion, feeling, etc. and is therefore not considered offensive.

As a American I truly believe the subversion of a elected president by our Justice department and the FBI is far worse for our Country.,"This tweet contains no offensive words or phrases. 
It is not critical of any group, person, or topic. 
 It expresses a positive opinion of how people should view documents.

"
681,681,@USER Oakland line sucks,"Oakland is a city in California. 
Sucks is an adjective that can describe a negative feeling or experience. 
  The word Oakland is used as a noun to refer to a line, typically a train line. Therefore, it is likely that the word is being used in the past tense, and the user was referring to the train lines in Oakland as ""sucking."" 
   
In this case, ""offensiveness"" is based primarily on using a derisive term to describe someone, especially someone of color.

"
682,682,@USER @USER @USER In a country where people openly abuse ram...krishna...tearing geeta is no bravery....real bravery would have been if she had done this with books belonging to other religions.....but then she is as big a coward as you are.,"'In a Country where People openly Abuse Ramkrishi is No Bravery' is an offensive statement. Ram krishi refers to Lord Ram, a Hindu deity. Tearing books of other faiths is a form of religious persecution. However, this statement is not only offensive, but also lacks any positive sentiment. It is negative and derisive. 
  
  'Real Braveness would Have Been If She Had Tore These Books With Books Belonging To Other Religions'  is also offensive and negative. This statement implies that Geeta, who is being praised, is only brave when she hurts other people. In reality, Geetaji is the one who has shown bravenESS by standing up for the rights of others.

  The use of derricks and masterminding in the context of raVEN is highly offensive and derogatory. 
In addition, this tweet appears to be a reference to a real event that took place between the two users, although the content of the event is not disclosed.

"
684,684,@USER Not surprising. That I*n C*nnor nigga was on the payroll,"* The word ""nigga"" is slang for ""boy"" and is considered offensive by many. 
  

https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=n*g*a*c*k*
""n-word"" (also spelled nigger, nig, niggah, or nige) is an offensive slur used to refer to black people. Although the word is often considered derisive, its use is not limited to derision. Some people find the term offensive only when used by black Americans.


In the context of this tweet the use of ""I*in"" implies that the person being referenced is black. This is offensive because ""i"" can be used as a slant on an eye or to indicate a first name. Therefore, ""in*"" could be interpreted as ""that nig*ga"".

"
685,685,@USER @USER @USER Says one of the thickest cultists on Twitter. Irony at its finest.,"There is a use or mention of a non offensive emojis (claps hands, light skintone)
However, there is also a discussion of an emoticons' use in a negative context (cultists) and a humorous context  (irony).

A:
According to the Twitter's guidelines, emoting is not considered as a form of expression.  
Emoting includes:  Using the face, eyes, and body to convey emotion.   
Using emotes that are offensive or abusive is against the rules.

"
686,686,@USER Blue Jamie Lee!! We won't miss ya....,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language.

  The use an emoticon indicates lightheartedness.

"
688,688,@USER @USER Hope you paid to use the image ...... and the appropriate tax of course. URL,"This tweet contains a URL, which is a form of explicit content. While the URL is not offensive, it is also not appropriate for free images. To use an image for commercial purposes, you must purchase the rights to do so from the original author.

"
689,689,@USER Climbs up the charts in Christian Music...only to wither as a fig on a tree as a false prophet. That is @USER,"Offensive language: ""fig"" and ""tree"" are offensive words. 
Slurs: the word ""wither"" is a slur for people of African descent. 
  The word ""@USER"" can be considered derrogatory because it's used to mock or belittle someone.

"
690,690,@USER He. Is. Here. For. Her.,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language. Specifically, ""here"" and ""her."" 
  
However, this is not the main point of the Tweet. Rather, he is here for her. This is an expression of love, and is therefore nonoffensiveness.

"
691,691,@USER Ouch!,"While the first tweet does contain offensive terms and language (e.g., ""liberals""), it does not express a negative or harmful sentiment. The user simply expressed their opinion on a political matter, and the language they used was neutral and nonoffensiveness. 
On the other hand, in the second tweet the offensive term ""ouch"" is used in a derisive manner, indicating a harmful or offensive sentiment towards the individual being referenced.

"
692,692,"""@USER @USER : When we lead, sheeple follow"""" URL""","This tweet does contain offensive terms, but they do not appear in a violent context. For example, ""sheeple"" is a derisive term for people who are easily influenced. 
  
  The term ""URL"" can be offensive if used in an internet context, however, in this case it is used as an acronym for ""user name address book"". This is not a threatening term.

"
693,693,@USER Oh my goodness she is so precious! Babies make everything better! Thank you for sharing :two_hearts: ,"Although the baby in the image is cute, its use in a political context is offensive. Babysitting is an important job, however, political babysitters are not appropriate. 
  
  The image of the cute baby is paired with a quote from a far-right figure that is considered offensive, which is why the quote is part of this tweet.

"
694,694,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Why do white liberals imagine white people have some power? White people have been trained for generations not be racially aware. White liberals are the most anti-white racists I know. What power do you imagine white people have that other people do not?,"Offensive language includes words such as the F-word, c-words, racial slurs, etc. 
  
  The term ""white liberals"" is derogatory towards white Americans. 
There is a strong implication in the text that the author of the Tweet believes that white individuals have power that they do
not actually have. This is an offensive statement towards a group of people.

"
695,695,@USER Most definitely. I’m not advocating playing either game. Just thinking aloud they might play earlier.,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language. However, they do not express personal attack or hatred towards the individual(s) mentioned in the Tweet. Rather, this tweet is expressing the employee’s personal interest in fashion games, her phobias, as well as her weirdness. 
  
  The employee in question does play Coventry (another fashion-based game), and her interest is shown in an nonjudgmentally positive light. She is also a little weird, so it’d be fair to say she is a weirder person than most. This is all shown through the use of the offensive words and phrases in this Tweets.

"
696,696,"""@USER @USER @USER Of course. Self defense. The well-known standing someone else's ground"""" rule. She was the only one armed, the one entering his property, the one starting the interaction, how the actual fuck is it self defense? Seriously dude, don't you have a cross to burn or something?""""""","She was a woman, so the comment about ""the only woman armed"" is considered offensive because women are often stereotyped as being less capable of defending themselves. 
""Standing someone'sground"" can also be seen as an offensive comment, as it implies that someone is less than human because they are not able to stand up for themselves, even if the person is armed. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter Rules, ""harassment"" includes ""abusive language,"" so that's probably why it was flagged.

"
697,697,@USER She is so cute ♡,"This tweet does contain strong words, but it is not explicit or explicit slur or derision. 
Although the content is political, there is no explicit content that is offensive or targeted at a specific group. 
  The user is merely expressing disagreement with a stance of another user.

"
698,698,"""@USER @USER @USER Conservatives are whining"""". There, I fixed the typo for you.""""""","In the original tweet the word whine was replaced with complaining. The replacement of a swear word with another word that has a similar meaning does change the meaning of the sentence, but does so in an acceptable way. 
  Whine is an expression of unhappiness, whereas complaining is the expression for something that is not desired but is nevertheless true. Therefore, whinge is also an unacceptable word, however, complaining can be used in sentences without causing offence.

"
699,699,@USER @USER @USER I'm assuming that @USER is a proponent of gun control. The argument for gun control is the threat of being shot. She then goes on to accuse people who open or conceal carry of being scared of a hypothetical fear of being shot. It's a hypocritical statement,"Offensive language is used in the Tweet, specifically the word ""hypocrit"" which refers to someone who is acting in a way that is contrary to their beliefs. 
  
  The Tweeter then accuses the person who owns a gun of acting out of fear, when in reality they are acting from a belief that guns are dangerous. This is an example of someone using language to make a point, and therefore the offensive nature of the language should be considered.

"
700,700,@USER @USER @USER @USER Antifa is banned by the central commitee for they are not proper socialists. More pinko then red.,"This tweet does express the opinion that Antifas are more like social democrats than true social-ists, and therefore not suitable to call themselves socialist. This opinion is based on Antifeas' perceived failure to carry out violent attacks on far-right groups, as well as their perceived unwillingness to engage in political activity that could be interpreted as violent. 
  
However, this opinion does also contain strong language that may be offensive to some readers. Therefore, we have classified this as a non offensive tweet.

"
701,701,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER This is not surprising. They're conservatives and they generally lack empathy for people who aren't them.,"In this tweet the author expresses their opinion that conservatives lack empathetic ability, and that is a reason why they will likely react negatively to accusations made against them. The author does express that this is based on their personal experience with conservatives as a member of the party, but does so in an nonoffensiveness way, by expressing their opinions about the topic without explicitly using derrogatory or offensive terms or language.

"
702,702,@USER Liberals at there lowest,"While the Tweet is not offensive, there is no explicit mention of any individuals or groups. There is also no negative or positive sentiment expressed towards anyone or any group, and the sentiment is more of a general statement about the political climate. 
"
703,703,@USER Lol okay cuz this shit gotta be discreet :face_with_tears_of_joy: ,"Angela is being referred to as ""she"" in the last tweet. While this is an acceptable pronoun for a female character in fiction, it can be offensive to some readers or viewers. 
  
In the first tweet Tyler expressed his opinion that Angela should have been cut after ""Brett"" after the ""showdown"" on ""The Challenge: War of The Worlds."" The word ""should"" is used in an offensive manner, suggesting that Tyler was suggesting Angela be punished for her actions. Additionally, Angela is referred as a ""character"" rather than a specific person, further contributing to the offensive nature of this tweet

A:
According to this article, ""offensiveness"" of a tweet depends on many factors, including: the use of slurs, personal insults, threats, appeals to racial or ethnic hatred, calls for violence, etc.  The article also notes that ""the line between opinion and attack is often blurry.""
I would recommend that you avoid using personal pronouns such as 'you' when responding to a user who uses offensive words. Instead, you could respond by using a generic pronoun such 'they' or 'he' to avoid offending the user.

"
704,704,@USER @USER You missed seeing Pruitt chewing butt all the way to the end. He's all business. I love it,"Pruett was not chewing but the butt of another person. This is unlikely to have been offensive, as it does not appear to target any individuals or groups. 
  
  The user is expressing their opinion that Pritty is all ""business"" and that they ""love it"". This does appear offensive but is more likely to offend the person being described than any other individuals.

"
705,705,@USER Low life bitches,"Low life is an offensive slang term that is generally used to describe a person who is unskilled or inferior in some way. Based on this definition, it seems likely that this term was used in the original tweet. 
  
  However, offensive terms should not be used lightly. Offensive terms can be considered slurs if they are used as a means to devalue or insult a group of people based upon their membership in that group, rather than as an expression of a view. In this case, although the term low life may be offensive in and of itself, its use in this context does appear to be a form of political discourse, in which case it should be treated as non offensive rather then offensive, as the use of the word is intended to express a point of view rather that insult or devaluation.

"
706,706,@USER @USER You are brave and have nothing to feel guilty about. You did what you needed to survive. Thank you for your courage.,"While the use of the word ""racist"" in this tweet may seem offensive, there is nothing in it that is racially derisive or offensive. The word is used in relation to a person, rather than a group, so it is not a slur. Additionally, while the emojis used may appear to be racists, they are not intended to offend anyone. 
  
  The second tweet expresses amusement at the idea of a ""joke"" being used to remove a president from office. While the sentiment may not be positive, this is a matter of opinion and does contain no offensive terms or language.

"
707,707,@USER why no witnesses? She reported it AT THE TIME! It’s obvious the truth isn’t your priority. There are other qualified conservatives judges. Why push him? Is it because your “president” is in legal jeopardy &amp; this Judge believes a sitting POTUS is untouchable? URL,"This tweet contains a link to a website that contains information about a case the author is involved in. The website does mention that the case is ""pending"" before a judge, but does so in relation to another case. In addition, there is no evidence in this tweet that links the mention to the current case or the judge's opinion of the President. Therefore, this is not an example of explicit, offensive, or otherwise problematic language.

"
708,708,@USER I hope the fuck not,"Offensive language includes words or phrases such as faggot, bitch, dyke, fag, queer, etc. that are considered to insult or demean someone based on their identity. 
Personal attacks include words like nag and whine that imply criticism without providing any factual basis. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as ""the expression of a negative or positive opinion of offensive qualities"".
In this case, I think the word ""fuck"" fits the bill.  It's a very strong word, with a lot of negative connotations, so it's likely that the algorithm would have classified this as being offensive, even though it doesn't contain offensive words.

"
709,709,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER DoYourJob DoTheRightThing -U all know well what a stellar SCOTUS JudgeKavanaugh will B-a documented lifetime of excellence Don't B puppets obstructing @USER who is MAGA &amp; KAG ConfirmKavanaughNow MAGA KAG,"There is nothing derisive or sarcasmic about the language used in this tweet. 
Although the word ""puppets"" is used, there is not an explicit suggestion that the people mentioned are puppeteers or that they are acting in any way other than what they believe to best serve the country.

"
710,710,@USER @USER lol Why would conservatives want to hide that? It contradicts everything Ford has claimed. :man_shrugging_medium-light_skin_tone: ,"In the above tweet the word ""conservatives"" is used as a slur to describe someone who would hide something that contradicts what Ford claims. This is an offensive term, as it implies that someone with a different opinion is not a human being. 
  
Without considering context, this tweet could be interpreted as supportive of Ford's political views, in which case it would be classified an non offensive prediction.

"
711,711,@USER @USER Isn’t that the Amazon bitch from Antifa?,"Amazon is a corporation. 
Antifa is an anti-fascist activist group. 
  Antioch is the name of a college campus. Antifascists are also known as anti fascists.  
Bitch is slang for a female. In this context, Amazon is referring to a person who is from the group Antiochus.

"

It does mention a specific person, but only in the context of the relationship between friends. 
  The relationship is not harmful to the person mentioned, and the mention is only a friendly greeting.

"
713,713,@USER @USER Is this occupy romper room?,"While the use ""offense"" in the context of the Tweet is subjective, there is not enough negative or explicit language to classify it as offensive. There are also no derrogatory words or negative sentiments in this TWEET.

"
714,714,@USER @USER Stay vigilant Conservatives!!,"In the first tweet the author is expressing confusion on how something is racist. The author does understand that it could be offensive, however, does lack understanding on that topic. 
Second tweet contains a positive message about Trump and is not considered offensive. 
"
715,715,@USER @USER Really a sickening issue. Liberals are vicious!!!,"'vicious' is an offensive word. 
  'Liberals are ""v""icious"" is also an offense word, as is 'vile'. 
   'Vicious', 'vil', and 'violent' are all offensive words.

"
716,716,@USER Yet she is fat herself.,"Offensive content can contain derisive remarks about an individual, group, belief, etc. that are meant to offend or cause harm. 
  
  The derision in this tweet could be directed at a person's weight, their physical appearance, a belief or political affiliation.

"
717,717,@USER Yeah I'll not take my gun control policy advice from a Jean's company. Beyond that trumps die hard are almost enough that the snowflakes they claim to dislike and themselves are hard to tell a part,"Jean's is an American fast food restaurant. 
'Beyond that' could mean 'in addition to that'.

I would say that this is not offensive.  It is simply a statement of fact.

Additionally, this term appears in a list of derision terms used by the user in another tweet that is also considered offensive and derrière. 
  The term ""RINO"" is an acronym for ""Republican In Name Only"" and is deriding to those who hold that political party affiliation.  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""derogation"" means ""the use of words, phrases, images or other content that denigrate or attack groups of individuals based on things they are or have done"".
In this context, derangement means the use or expression of ideas that are deranged. Derogative terms are often derided.

"
720,720,@USER @USER @USER @USER you are alienating your supporters disgusted URL,"In the original tweet the word ""alienating"" is used to describe the actions of someone who is ""disgusted"" by their supporters. This is an offensive term to use to refer to someone expressing their discontent with something. 
  
  The use the term ""URL"" to express disgust is also offensive as it implies that the supporter is being ""manipulated"" or ""controlled"" in some way.

"
721,721,@USER You are a cheater casey!,"In the original tweet the user accused Casey of cheating, a personal attack. 
  However, in context, Casey was not present during the conversation and the accusation was made against a third party, so it was considered a non offensive personal insult.

"
722,722,@USER I was on a conference call after the election of our President. 30 minutes of Ted Lieu discussing how to stop Trump. This guy supports Antifa. Maxine is his mentor.,"This tweet contains offensive words and language. The word ""mate"" is considered offensive in many parts of the English-speaking world. ""Mentor"" can be considered derisive or offensive towards women. 
  
  The word Antifaschistische (Antifa) is also considered to have offensive connotation. Antigovernment is another term that can have a negative impact on some users. These words are considered highly offensive by many people.

But it’s because the Browns didn’t gameplan for him like they would Bell,"It does mention a person who has assaulted women, but it does so in passing and without explicitly using offensive terms or describing the assault in negative terms (e.g., ""raped"").
While the person mentioned in this tweet is Trump, it doesn't contain any explicit derisive language. The person is simply referred to by their nickname, Trump (which is not offensive by itself).
Although the topic discussed in that tweet (presidential debates) is political, there is nothing in it that would make it offensive.

"
724,724,@USER @USER Eric is a crook and that’s that,"While the word ""that"" is used to introduce a statement, ""Eric is"" a direct quotation of the previous statement. This is an example of ""quotation mining"", where Twitter's algorithm uses the surrounding text to determine the sentiment of a tweet. In this instance, since the statement is negative and directly quoting another negative statement (from the same user), the algorithm predicts that the original author of this tweet would also use the term ""crook"" to describe Goodall. 
  
This is in contrast to the non offensive tweet above, where the author is stating an hypothetical and non derrogatory opinion.

"
725,725,@USER They don’t want you following people because they don’t like conservatives! Sickening how biased Twitter’s management is. TwitterLeftBias,"While the sentiment expressed in the above tweet may be considered offensive by some, Twitter's Terms of Service explicitly state that the service is intended for ""entertainment and informational purposes,"" and that ""we do not condone or support any form of harassment.""

726,726,Women were treated as 2nd class citizens for thousands of years. We are supposed to be an enlightened society. There's NO reason women should not be treated as equals now. Sexual assault is a crime! FBI needs to investigate Kavanaugh! @USER MAGA MakeAmericaGreatAgain,"Women have been treated differently throughout history. This tweet implies that women are not treated equally now, even though the United States is considered a ""more enlightened"" society than it was in the past. 
  
Sexual assault has many causes, including gender, culture, environment, power dynamics, personality, or other factors. It is not a solely a women's issue. Therefore, this tweet could imply that sexual assault against men is also occurring. 
FBI needs investigate the sexual assaults against Kavanaugh. He is an accused rapist.

We need common sense gun control laws to protect the constituents in CA23 &amp; the nation from people who shouldn’t be allowed to own a gun! dosomething votethemout voteBlue2018 @USER,"While the language in question is offensive, there is no explicit slur, derogy, threat, insult, etc. in it. 
  The statement is calling for action to a local issue, which is generally considered to not be offensive.

728,728,guncontrol Gun Control Chalenge If you truly belive in gun control I chalenge you to learn and understand what gun control is Take a conceal carry course then spend enough time On a certified gun range To familerize yourself with firearms and learn what gun control truly is..,"In the first part of this tweet the user is calling for gun controls, suggesting that the target of their criticism should take a course on gun laws and spend time on a gun ranges. This is a non offensive request, as it doesn't contain any offensive terms or accusations. 
  
However, in a later part the author of that tweet makes a direct accusation against the person they are criticizing, using offensive words. In this case the term ""gun control"" is offensive, and the rest of text is not considered to be offensive.

"
729,729,@USER @USER Actually I think Antifa over took them and YOU contributed to their silence too..,"Antifa is a left-wing activist group that has engaged in violence and other forms of illegal behavior. Their tactics are often controversial, and the group has received criticism for its tactics and tactics that have been used against them. 
  
Although the use and targeting of Antifas in the Tweet is offensive, there is no indication that the author of this Tweeple is affiliated with Antifea or that their use or targeting is intended to harm any individuals or groups.

"
730,730,@USER Didn’t know he was still alive.,"While the content of the Tweet may be considered non offensive, there is a strong tone of sarcasm in the user's response. This is not the first time that @Jackie has received this type of response and the language used is similar to previous responses.

"
731,731,@USER I am a survivor of sexual abuse. This woman is obviously lying. Believe me you remember every detail. It's so obvious these woman only come forward to hurt conservatives. But who they truly are hurting is innocent men and women who really have been abused. She should be ashamed!,"This tweet contains a personal attack on another user, stating that they are ""obviously lying."" 
While the user in question has not responded to the Tweet, it can be inferred from their Twitter bio that this user has a history of making false claims about others. 
  
""I am survivor"" is an offensive statement to make about someone who has experienced sexual assault. 

 

Additionally, this tweet includes derisive language towards another Twitter user. ""She should [be] ashamed"" implies that the other user was not honest about their experience, rather it was a deliberate attempt to mislead.

"
732,732,@USER @USER @USER Now we just need antifa outside when they confirm kavanaugh,"This tweet contains a reference to a real event that happened in Washington, D.C. on October 24, 2019. Antifa is a far-left extremist group that protests and causes violence against conservatives and other groups they disagree with. They have been accused by multiple people of committing acts of violence, including the murder of a police officer. 
  
  The reference in this tweet to Antifa is likely the source of offense for some users.

"
733,733,@USER @USER @USER @USER Antifa has new uniforms?,"Antifa is a far-left extremist group that has committed violent acts. Their new uniform is an attempt to mislead people into thinking they are nonviolent.


Non-Offensive Tweets:

  She was gifted everything by father, and one her least empower women. 
Ivana is dependent of father for everything. Disempower women

  
  @TWEET Ivana: She spoke about Empowerment of Women, She Is Embarrassed.  Her Father Gave Everything To Her, And One Of Her Lowest Empowered. 

  Tweeter: @TUSER  Antifas new Uniform is misleading. They are violent extremists. And they have committed numerous violent crimes. Please report them. @CIA

"
734,734,@USER @USER @USER She is just so effortlessly funny :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: ,"She may have been joking, but the statement is still considered offensive. The word ""effortlessly"" is used in the context of humor, so it's not considered derisive or offensive in and of itself. However, in addition to being a humorous statement, ""she is so Effortless Funny"" implies that the speaker finds the other person to be particularly funny, a statement that is derrogatory and offensive to some groups.

"
735,735,Confirm the MAN! THE LEFT WING ACTIVIST IS A LIAR WHO'S STORY CHANGES! NO HARD EVIDENCE! ChristineBlaseyFord Innocent until proven guilty! ConfirmKavanaugh MAGA @USER WeakRinos Republicans,"This tweet uses strong and offensive words to describe a person. 
  The words ""liar,"" ""story changes,"" and ""weak"" are considered derisive and demeaning. Additionally, ""innocent"" is a legal term that can be used to refer to someone who is presumed innocent until found guilty by a court of law. Using these words in this context is offensive and could be considered harassment.

"
736,736,@USER @USER is so stupid it makes her sooooooo HOT,"Offensive content: Machine gun Kelly is mentioned in this tweet. 
Machine gunKelly is a controversial artist known for her explicit lyrics and violent imagery. She has also been the subject of calls for legal action by various civil rights groups. 
  
Non-Offensiveness: the content is about Elimem ""gun control"" and mentions his comeback against her. This is not considered offensive as it's just a discussion about artists and their actions

@user: ""@USER I'm so glad you're following me now. I've been wanting to follow you for years now.""
User: ""Oh, thank you @user! I hope to keep up with you guys for many years to come."" 

 

A:
According to this article, ""Machine Gun"" Kelly has a fan following of over 2.5 million on Twitter.  Her lyrics are explicit and she has faced legal actions for them.   Her most famous song is ""Me, Myself and I"".  The song has over 8 million views on YouTube.    
I would classify this as Offensive, as Machine Guns lyrics is explicit, she's been sued for explicit content, her most well known song contains explicit language and imagery, etc.

"
737,737,"""@USER Paris Terror Attacks brought to you by Eric Holder on behalf of the Obama Administration. Oh but Gun Control"""". URL""","This tweet contains a link to an article about the 2015 Paris terror attacks. The article contains inflammatory language and content, including the use of derisive terms to refer to the victims of those attacks, as well as the suggestion that the attacks were orchestrated by the United States government. 
  
However, this tweet does contain offensive slur and targeted content towards an individual, Eric L. Holder Jr., who was the former Attorney General of United State at the time of this article's publication. This content is clearly offensive and should not have been posted.

U pple scare me is it green today or is it yellow :face_with_tears_of_joy: :exclamation_question_mark: ,"Language like ""pple"" is slang for ""people"" and is therefore not derisive or offensive. 
""Wow!"", ""is it"", and ""scare me"" are all nonoffensives. 
  ""Those ppl"" refers to ""liberals"" which are a group of people, so the use of ""those"" in this context is also not harmful.

"
739,739,@USER @USER Just don't go to Bank of America unless you are ready to prove that you are citizen every time you want to get your money out of your account.,"This tweet contains no explicit slur or offensive term. 
It expresses concern that a person might commit violence against certain individuals or organisations. This type of concern is generally not considered to be offensive.

"
740,740,@USER @USER We loved hearing Laura speak in Duluth! She is truly a strong supporter of our beloved President...we need to flip MN RED!!!!,"Laura is a well-known politician who supports President Trump. She spoke in a public event, DulUTH, where she was not expected to receive a large amount of attention. Therefore, it was considered acceptable for her to speak publicly about her support for President. 
  
Machine GunKelly is an artist known for his controversial lyrics and persona. He has also been known to criticize PresidentTrump. In this tweet he is criticizing Laura for supporting President, even though she is not personally supporting him. MachineGunKelly's criticism is based off of his personal dislike for Laura, not her political views. As a result, this is classified non offensive.

"
741,741,@USER @USER @USER Nasty a$$ Liberal sheep...you are prime example of sheeple with NO BRAIN.,"This tweet could be considered offensive if it was a personal attack on a specific group of people, such as liberals or sheep. However, it does not contain any personal insults or attacks. Rather, this tweet was intended to be humerous or even playful. 
  
  The user also uses the word ""nasty"" to describe someone with no brain, a term that is generally considered to have a negative connotation. This could also be a reason why the prediction was classified non offensive.

"
742,742,@USER Please Confirm Kavanagh ASAP! He is a fine choice! Don't let the liberals derail his nomination to the SCOTUS!,"In this tweet the author expresses their strong opinion on a political candidate. While the candidate is not named, based on context it is clear that the opinion is directed at Kavanaugh. 
  The author states that Kavalaugh is ""a fine candidate"" and that ""liberals don't want him on SCotus"". 
   The use of the word ""derail"" in the last sentence is considered derisive and offensive, and is therefore classified in this case as offensive.

"

ONLY an 80% bump over 3 years. liberals friendsandfamily ethics cdnpoli URL,"This tweet does not contain any derisive or offensive terms or language. The author is simply expressing their opinion on a political topic. 
  
  The author acknowledges the political stances of the individuals mentioned in the text, and is expressing a neutral opinion. 
Although the author does mention that they work at a company named MorNEAU ShePell, they do not name any of its executives or employees. This is to avoid identifying the individual in a derrogatory manner.

"
744,744,@USER Yeah sucks honestly but I plan on coming back on variety rather than fortnite and if the opportunities are nice to start esport on another game but I can approve that fortnite esport is over for me.,"Offensive language: the word'sucks' is offensive because it is derisive and negative. 
  
  Offensiveness of 'antifa caught off guard after getting confronted by the last person they ever wanted to answer too': the phrase 'the last people they wanted' implies that Antifas are a group of people, rather that a single person, and the use of this phrase is therefore derrogatory.

"
745,745,@USER Sorry you’re a socialist!! I contributed to Ted Cruz!! Sick of liberals,"Offensive language includes explicit words or phrases that are considered to contain negative connotations towards a group of people, such as ""faggot"", ""retard"", or ""pig"". 
  
  The word ""sick"" is considered offensive because it is derisive and can also be considered as an insult. 
   
""Liberal"" can have different connotation, but it can still be offensive if used as insult, for example, ""I'm a liberal and I don't like Trump"".

A:
According to the Twitter's TOS, you can not use ""hate"" or any other derrogatory word to another person. So, I would say that the word sick is offensive, because is used to insult someone.

"
746,746,@USER About 20 of them Motherfuckers :double_exclamation_mark: ,"This tweet contains explicit language that is considered to have a harmful or offensive intent, such that it would be classified by an automated classifier as being offensive: the word ""motherfucker"" is used as a derisive term to refer to a person of a particular race or ethnicity. 
  
  The user who sent this tweet is also the one mentioned in the previous tweet. This tweet appears intended to call out the other user for sharing an offensive tweet about another individual.

Thank you for this masterpiece! garynuman Savage no2album URL,"""BITE"" is an explicit word that could potentially be considered offensive, especially when used in the context of Antifas. 
While the sentiment expressed in this tweet may be debatably offensive or controversial, ""Antifa is terrorist org"" does contain slurring terms and derrogatory comments targeting Antiracist groups, so the overall sentiment is offensive

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, if a tweet contains explicit words or phrases that might offend some users, you should flag the Tweet for review.

"
748,748,@USER @USER the right to protest. Protesting during the anthem causes people to not even recognize what he is protesting nobody's even talking about the issue just the fact that he's kneeling during the anthem which is counterproductive,"While the language in the Tweet is strong, there are no negative or offensive sentiments expressed. 
Although the protest of which the author is speaking is against the US government, he or she does express support for the rights of protestors. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as ""the use or threat to use words, phrases, or emojis that some people find offensive"".
In this case, I think the word ""protest"" would be offensive to many people, so the label ""non- offensive"" seems appropriate.

"
749,749,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Conservatives who love draft dodgers. I love it.,"This tweet does contain strong language that is offensive. However, it is also clear that the author is trying to have a civil discussion about a topic of political importance. Offensive language is often used in political discourse, so the label of nonoffensiveness is still a bit of a stretch. 
  
  The author of this tweet believes that conservatives who support gun rights are not ""real"" conservatives. While this is an opinion, this opinion is based on facts and is therefore not considered to be offensive by the Twitter community.

"
750,750,@USER The vile creature is trying to portray herself as some fierce bitch at the same time she knows that's not what the gun control conversation is about. Paper tiger,"In the first part of the Tweet, @user refers to a group of people as ""vile creatures"" and ""paper tigers"". These derisive terms are considered offensive by the Twitter community. 
  
  In addition, in response to the question ""So the ar- 15 is fully automatic?"", the @ user's response is ""gun control doesn't work, & Donald trump is not racist"". The use and repetition of ""not"" in this response can also be seen as aggressive.

"
751,751,@USER UK Govt non announcements are the only consistant and affordable policy under Labour or Conservatives for decades. Designed for a soundbite. No immediate resource required. Never likely to ever be implemented. Its propoganda but sadly it has its desired effect.,"This tweet does contain some slurring and offensive terms, however, they are used in a way that is not derisive or intended to offend. Rather, it is clear that the author is using slang and colloquialisms to express their opinion on current political events. 
  
  The slurred terms used include ""Parasite"", ""SoundbITE"", and ""Cute"". These terms are not used derisorily or in an offensive manner, and the context of the entire tweet makes it clear the terms were used figuratively. Additionally, there is nothing in the content of this tweet that would indicate it was intended towards any individual in particular.

"
752,752,@USER He is what the industry stands for. All about spreadsheets and no care for the human side.,"This tweet contains a slur against a group of people, namely ""industry"", which is a derisive term for a subset of a person or organization. 
  
  The slang term is meant to be derrogatory, and the use in this context is not meant as a personal attack on any individuals or groups.

"
753,753,"""@USER @USER Love it that SHE's willing to pay the price""""...that someone else will pay. Liberals are INSANE""""""","This tweet contains no offensive or derisive language. 
It is a light-hearted complaint about a person not sending the person a birthday greeting. 
  

Overall, I think the model is fairly accurate in its predictions. I would like to share the link to this model with Jourdana and Hayleys parents.

"
754,754,@USER She is drinking so much koolaid she’s bloated.,"This tweet contains no explicit slur or offensive term. 
  The use a koo-laid emojis with the user is a slang term used by the internet to describe someone who is overly intoxicated. This term is not considered derisive or pejorative by any community standards. 
However, this tweet could be offensive to some because it implies that the other person in this scenario is stupid for drinking too much.

"
755,755,@USER @USER @USER @USER I’m not sad. I’m fucking angry... angry that the GOP is embracing fascism. My grandfather was Antifa from 1942-1945. I’m following in his footsteps. His friends didn’t die in vain for nothing. URL,"While the first tweet was not offensive, it was clearly making light of the situation and expressing an opinion about the actions of Antifas, rather then addressing the individual directly. The second tweet contains explicit language and a clear target of an individual, who was mentioned by name. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter's TOS, you can't threaten or abuse anyone. So, @user is right, this user is abusing him.

"
756,756,@USER yo he is gorgeous :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: ,"This tweet does not contain any explicit offensive content, such as slurs, personal insults, racial epithets, etc. 
It simply describes the physical appearance of a person. 
"
757,757,@USER You are becoming the court jester of the senate,"In the first tweet the user uses the word 'damn' which is considered an offensive word. 
Secondly, in the second tweet there is a term that is generally considered to have a sexual connotation, 'liar'.

A:
According to the Twitter's TOS, you can't use profanity in a Tweet. So, @USER should have used a different word to express the same sentiment.

"
758,758,Liberals have destroyed California just like they are attempting to do to the rest of the country. Radicals don't belong in any area of our governments. Grown ups belong there. URL,"While the mention that liberals have ""destroyed California"" could potentially be offensive, in context it is a statement of fact. California has a history of liberal policies, and the statement is not meant to insult liberals. 
In addition, ""grown ups"" is an idiom that is commonly used in a nonoffensiveness manner.

"
759,759,@USER @USER Liberals have no shame. To them the outcome justifies the mean,"This tweet does contain derisive language and offensive terminology, but the context makes it clear that the author is simply expressing their opinion. 
  
  The author uses offensive words like ""shame"" and ""Liberals"" to describe a group of people. While derision is often used to express disagreement, this deriding language is used in a derrogatory way, suggesting that someone is lacking in some way. In this context, ""liberALS"" is derided as a pejorative term for people who support liberal causes. ""Shame,"" on its own, is neither derisoric nor derrogeous. However, when used as an adjective to modify "" Liberals,"" the derisoing tone is clear.

"
760,760,@USER Perhaps he is going to talk about pedestal and all the collusion by the HRC campaign!! After all this investigation is not only to be about Prasident Trump. Plenty of illegal activity by the dnc and Clinton campaign!,"This tweet contains an explicit reference to the presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, suggesting that she might have committed crimes. 
While the reference is explicit, it does so in an ironic way that makes it clear that Clinton is being referenced in jest. This is a mitigating factor in this case. 
  
However, this tweet also contains a suggestion that JF Kennedy Jr. might talk more about ""pedestal"" in his upcoming testimony. While this is an interesting topic, there is nothing in Kennedy's tweet that would suggest that he will bring up the topic of ""Pedestel"" as part of his testimony, so this prediction is also incorrect.

"
761,761,@USER I won’t even start Naruto cause it’s just too much :face_with_tears_of_joy: I started an anime on Hulu yesterday called Coppelion thats only one season that’s more my speed lol,"This tweet contains a reference to an animeshipped on hulu. Animes are typically considered to be a form of entertainment that is not appropriate for work. 
  
  The anime Copper Lancer is about a ninja who fights in medieval times. This is a popular genre of anime that can be considered offensive to some viewers. In this case, it was likely the use that made the viewer feel uncomfortable.

"
762,762,@USER @USER The problem for May is how it will devastate her government &amp; party. The ERG will go bonkers &amp; try to stop a second vote. Result chaos. Many Conservatives fear this will totally destroy the party. But repressing it WILL.,"This tweet does not contain any explicit language that is offensive or hurtful. Although the word'repress' is commonly used to describe the suppression of political dissidents, it does have a neutral meaning in this context. 
  
Although the text of the Tweet is difficult to read, there is nothing in it that would be considered offensive. In particular, although the author is responding to a comment, they are not making derisive comments about the commenter. Instead, their comment is aimed at explaining why the prediction is that the tweets are offensive, rather then addressing any of these points directly.

"
763,763,@USER @USER @USER @USER That's just depressing. Good churches are getting hard to find. Few and far between. I know people who belong to churches that espouse gun control and abortion! That's politics - not God! Not Christ!,"This tweet does contain derisive language towards Catholics, but it is
  not explicit and does  contain a positive sentiment. 
  The  tweet  is  more  of  a  humorous  observation  about  people's  possible  late-nigh  snacking  habits,  which  can  be  offended.

"
764,764,@USER @USER @USER @USER But here is an easy chance to prove me wrong. Show me one instance where increased gun control in this country caused a decrease in crime with guns.,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and derrogatory words, but the context makes it clear that they are meant to be humorous. For example, ""one instance"" is used to emphasize that there are many examples of gun laws having no effect on crime rates. Additionally, it's clear from context that this tweet was written in response to the previous one, where the author is challenging the other user to provide an example of a country with increased restrictions on gun ownership and a decreased crime rate. 
  The author of the original tweet clearly intended for this to not be offensive, as he is using derisive language to make a point.

"
765,765,@USER She's brilliant. You are not.,"A:

I would say that the following tweet contains offensive slur: ""@USER You're not brilliant.""
Offensive slang is slurred words that are used by people who are less educated or have lower social status. The slanguage is used to insult someone. 
In this case, ""you"" is the person who is being insulted, and ""brilliant"" means that person is very good. So the insult is ""You are NOT brilliant"".

"
766,766,just saw a group of freshmen wearing maga bucket hats :nauseated_face: :nauseated_face: :nauseated_face: :nauseated_face: :nauseated_face: :nauseated_face: :nauseated_face: i hate this school,"This tweet contains no explicit threats or language that is offensive. The word hat is used in the context of a fashion trend, and the phrase ""maga bucket hat"" could refer to many types of hats. 
  
However, this tweet could also be considered offensive due to its tone. While the sentiment is supportive, there is also a clear negative sentiment towards the school and its students. This is likely due, in part, to a personal experience with the institution.

"
767,767,@USER @USER @USER How could anyone want to vote for a Democrat who wants open borders and gun control,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language. 
  The user used offensive words such a ""racist"" and ""fuck"" in the original tweet. 
However, it does appear to have been a joke, as it was in response to another user who was discussing gun policy. In addition, there is nothing derisive or mocking about it, so it could be considered non offensive.

"
768,768,@USER Because Obama has zero accomplishments. He is the worst President r leader of any country hands down. It shows the liberal lunacy when they worship a total loser. They don't know what they want..no party goals. nothing except complain about TRUMPS accomplishments. Fu*k liberals.,"Offensive language: Obama is a derisive term used to refer to someone who is new to politics. The term is derrogatory and offensive to many people. 
Personal attacks: There is no evidence of personal attack in this tweet. 
  The author is merely expressing their opinion. This is not a personal insult.

"
769,769,22 kids a day. Every day. URL,"22 children a DAY. EVERY DAY!
URL
This is a reference to a statistic that 22 children are murdered and abused every day, which is often used as an example of the prevalence of child abuse. While the term "" URL "" is considered informal, it does contain slurring and offensive terms, and is therefore considered derisive and not nonoffensiveness.

"
770,770,@USER @USER so true for lucky she is appearing in lot of projects,"In the first tweet the writer expresses gratitude to a political party for their beliefs. This is an expression of positive emotion and is not considered offensive. 
Secondly, in this tweet a niece of a user is mentioned. Cheerleading is also an acceptable profession and the use the nickname'stinky butt' is affectionate. 
  The third tweet simply asks the author to not lie.

"
771,771,"""@USER @USER should careful!! all things will use to against him, It's kind of a hit job by Someone or a Group?? That's Interview"""" was used to victimize him, he should be careful to act from now on!!""""""","@user should take extra care in the future. 
This tweet is a form of cyberbullying. 
  The user was targeted and used in order to harm them.

"
772,772,@USER She is a gorgeous little mini you. :red_heart: :cherry_blossom: ,"This tweet contains a reference to the Disney movie The Little Mermaid, which is an example of an innocent or family-friendly movie that can be used to teach children appropriate language. 
  
While the movie is family friendly, it does contain some mature themes, including a character's sexuality and the dangers of drinking alcohol. This tweet references a line from the film, where a woman says ""she is gorgeous, you are a little mermaids dream."" The word choice in the line is not necessarily offensive, but it could also be considered age-inappropriate for a tweet from a teenager. In addition, this tweet was sent to another teenager, so the author may have been trying to communicate a similar sentiment but may not have used the most appropriate words.


In addition to using a Disney reference, there is also a strong positive tone to this message, with the use a combination of emojis and hashtags to express excitement about a person's appearance. While the tone of this Tweet is positive, its language is age inappropriate for its target audience. Therefore, we classify this as a non offensive tweet. 


Note: We classified this example as offensive because of its use the the offensive word 'Ree' in combination with 'e'.

"
773,773,@USER @USER Antifa aren't fascist They're terrorist,"Antifa is a well-known activist group that stands for ""anti-fascist"" and ""antifascists."" The group has taken a strong stance against far-right groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan and the National Socialist Movement. Antifaschistische Aktion, a German anti-Nazi resistance movement, was founded in Munich in 1923. 
  
Fascism is an extreme form of socialism, which is another extreme political ideology. Fascism has a long history of being used by dictators and governments to oppress their opponents. In recent years, far right groups have gained power in many countries, including the United States. These groups espouse racism, misogyny, and anti semitism. They also have ties to white supremacy and neo-nazism. 
Anti-fa is not a term used to refer to these groups. Instead, they are often referred to as ""fash,"" "" antifa,"" or "" anti fascists"" to distinguish them from far left groups that use the term.

I sometimes think that he is more of Prophet"""" than a President in all the wise words he thinks about and speaks about. :heart_suit: """"""","Although the word ""Dear"" is used in the third tweet to address President Barack Obama, this is not offensive. "" Dear "" is a common way to refer to someone when expressing respect or admiration. 
  
In the fourth tweet PresidentObama is presented as a ""Stellar Man"" who is ""more of a Prophet"" than just a president. This is an example of how the President is referred to in a complimentary way.

It is not clear from the text of this tweet whether the author believes the information in the article is incorrect or not. However, it does contain personal insults and derrogatory comments about the source of information, so it would be considered offensive. 
  
Additionally, this is an example of micro-aggressions, where a person
attributes a negative characteristic to a different group than the one
being described. In this case, ""liberals"" are being described as ""far-
right"", when in fact liberals are not a homogenous group and many of them

  The use of ""stupid"" and ""easily persuaded"" is derisive and dismissive of people with different opinions. ""Redneck"" can be derided as an offensive term.

"
783,783,@USER @USER @USER Liberals can’t meme. They have no sense of humor or knowledge of meme-ing philosophy.,"While the first tweet may have been critical, it was not intended to offend anyone.  The user was simply expressing their opinion on Ivana's lack of knowledge and experience in certain areas. 
  
In the second tweet the author was expressing frustration with the lackluster performance of a memeing app. While the app may not have met the standards of other memes, this does little to detract from the quality of its content.

785,785,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER So the first thing you do is put the black guy up and call out that we are using the race card. Shows how racist you are. Maybe put a Latino or woman up next.,"Using the word ""racist"" to describe someone's opinion is a very strong accusation, so it's possible that the author of this tweet was using it in an offensive way. 
  
However, ""using the term 'racial justice' to refer to the idea of treating people equally regardless of their race"" is an example of a nonoffensiveness, as it doesn't contain offensive terms or concepts.

787,787,@USER And shit like this is why no real research gets done on us.,"Offensive content: the word ""research"" is used as a derisive term to describe real scientific research, and the statement ""no real science gets [done] on [us]"" is a criticism of how science is conducted in general. 
Personal attacks: ""real"" science does get done, but it doesn't get reported on mainstream media because it isn't ""newsworthy.""
Derogative language: using the term ""racist"" to refer to someone who disagrees with you is derrogatory. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""derogation"" and ""offense"" are not considered derision or offense.  They are considered to be violations of Twitter's rules.

"
788,788,@USER Also Puerto Rico is a island add in the middle of the Atlantic and people have nowhere to go. If a big enough hurricane comes through there everyone could die.,"This tweet contains no explicit language that is offensive or targeted at any individuals or groups. However, it does express the opinion that Puerto Ricans should be relocated to another island if a hurricane were to hit their home island. This is an unpopular opinion, but is neither offensive nor derisive.

"
789,789,@USER If you want more shooting just call G Soros! He’s always happy to oblige with that! He pays antifa well,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
It expresses a personal opinion, which is generally not considered offensive.

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as ""the expression of negative opinions, especially ones that are biased or inflammatory"".
I agree with the classification of the second Tweet as being offensive, as the word ""fuck"" has a negative connotation.

"
791,791,@USER You are agent of Crypt agentofChaurch . So don’t speak on temples. @USER @USER @USER,"There is nothing derrogatory or threatening in either the language of the original tweet or the response. 
Both the subject matter (Goodell) and sentiment (positive) of this tweet are in line with Twitter's guidelines on abusive language. 
  The use and context of emoticons and nicknamed cheerleaders are also not offensive.

Are you contributing to it?URL partisanship tcot Conservatives conservative GOP Democrats Progressives Liberals think Reason,"While the language used in the Tweet is not offensive, there is an underlying negative attitude towards the user and the group they belong to. This is because the author is criticizing the users' opinions and beliefs, rather than expressing their own. 
  
  The author also uses offensive slang and language, such as ""tribalism"" which is derisive towards people who are not part of a political group.

"
794,794,@USER @USER I loathe @USER,"@USER is a Twitter user name. 
Stamp is another Twitter usernames. 
  The @ signs before the usages of these two Twitter users names indicate that they are Twitter handles. Twitter handle is an identifier that is used to identify and communicate with an individual Twitter account. It is similar to a username but is much more limited in scope.

"
795,795,@USER For what??? Lies and rumors being spread by liberals with their known pattern? Hell NO.,"Offensive language is used to insult or degrade a person or a group of people. 
  The language used in the above tweet includes derisive terms such as ""hell no"" and ""liars and rumours"". 
   These terms are likely to offend a large number of users.

"
796,796,@USER Deranged and demented what a perfect match for the Democratic party,"Deranged is an insult used to describe someone who is mentally ill. 
  DementED is another insult that describes someone with dementia. Both of these insults are used in this tweet to refer to the Antifas movement. Antifea is the political wing of the left and is known for their violent protests and rhetoric.

"
797,797,@USER @USER The left doesn’t care. They victimize women and minorities for political gain. Same story different democrat. libtards walkaway maga,"While the first half of the quote is not offensive, there are several instances of hateful language in it, including the use the word ""libtard"" to describe Democrats, as well as the statement that Democrats ""walk away"" with ""Maga"". These statements are highly offensive and do not appear to have been intended as a joke. 
"
798,798,@USER Fat ass.... heart attack city..... keep eating fat ass....,"@USER is used to express a person or entity. In this case, it's a Twitter account. 
Fat ass is an offensive term to describe someone who has a large amount of body fat. 
  Heart attack City is also an offensice term used in this context. This term is often used by people who have had a heartattack.  
Keep eating Fat Ass is another offensive phrase used here.

"
799,799,@ everyone who said jihoons new hair cut is ugly: you are wrong,"While the word ""jihoon"" is not offensive, its use in the context of a hairstyle is. ""Ji"" means ugly and ""ho"" refers to hair. 
  
  The word is used in a derisive manner.

"

""Antifa"" is an acronym for ""anti-fascist"" which has a generally positive connotation. 
  ""The endless"" attacks are not offensive, as they do not appear to contain a specific negative intent.

"
801,801,"""@USER It's kind of like when a mean old woman says that a pretty young one is Ugly and untalented"""" just because she is washed up and will never look like that again.

Montel""""""","This tweet contains derisive language and slurring words, such as ""Ugly"" (which is an offensive slang term for ""Black""), ""washed up"" (""washed"" is slurred as well), and ""never look again""  (""again"" also slursed as a racial slag). 
  
  The author of the Tweet is clearly frustrated with the response to a previous tweet and uses derrogatory and offensive terms to express her frustration. 
   

A:
According to the Twitter's TOS, you can't use the service to promote hate groups. So, I think the above tweet violates the terms of service.

"
802,802,@USER @USER @USER That's why what she did was an ANTIFA style attack. Abusive method meant to bully opposition into silence for control,"This tweet does contain derisive language, but it does so in the context of explaining a point of view. 
  The derision is directed at an individual who is not present in this conversation, who has no control over the person being derided, or who does have control but chooses not take action.

"
803,803,@USER @USER with this useless try hard comedian love preaching hate about @USER They have so much hate in them for a guy they loved before he was president. Maybe infatuated with the guy. She must dream about him.,"This tweet contains a slur against a person or a group of people. ""Try hard"" is a derogatory term used to describe someone who is not very skilled or talented. 
  
""Love preaching"" and ""hate"" are strong words that can be used in many ways. In this case, it seems the author is criticizing the person mentioned for loving the president and preaching about it. This is likely to cause offense to some people, as it is perceived as an attack on their character.

"
804,804,@USER she is hungery,"She is Hungery is a slur used to describe a woman who is overweight. 
  The word is used in an offensive manner in this tweet and is not used lightly.

"
805,805,@USER @USER @USER I really think he is mentally ill. Why does his family not address the issues? Maybe Jared did with the op-ed?,"This tweet does express a negative opinion towards a person or persons, but it does so in a nonoffensve manner. The user is not expressing a personal opinion, nor is she making a direct attack on anyone. She is merely stating an observation based on facts. 
  
  The user also expresses a positive opinion of a third party, in this case a niece of the person being criticized. This is also a factor in determining whether or not a tweet could be considered offensive. Offensive content is subjective and based more on how people perceive it, rather than whether it actually is offensive or negative.

"
806,806,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Dont keep signing all this talent for what so they can be on main event ever week or get lost in the Shuffle Chad cable is a amazing wrestling but he is in a tag team with Bobby Rhoode that dont make any sense and people wonder why cody left because he is a main event talent,"Although the user's opinion is not necessarily offensive, their use of derisive language and slang is. 
  The user uses derrogatory slangs and language to refer to professional wrestlers, and their lack of context makes it unclear what the intent of this tweet was.

"
807,807,@USER Heidi Cruz started life as a brunette. Now she is a blonde. God works in mysterious ways.,"This tweet contains a derisive reference to Heidrick Cruz, a former presidential candidate, as being a ""brunet"" (a reference typically used to describe a person with brown or dark hair). 
  
While the reference is derrogatory, there is no explicit reference of any physical characteristic of the former candidate. However, this is still considered offensive because the derision is directed at a specific person. 
   
Additionally, Heiði Cruz is referred to as ""Heidrich Cruz"" in the third line, where the name is misspelled. This is also considered deriding, because it implies that the candidate is ignorant of her own name.

"
808,808,@USER Absolutely. He is very special.,"A:

I would say that the word ""cute"" is not offensive.  It is an adjective, and it can be used to describe any object or person. 
However, ""until proven guilt"" could be considered offensive, because the phrase implies that there is some sort of legal process that must occur before someone can or should be judged guilty.

"
809,809,@USER because im a broke ass bitxh :(((( and LOL EVEB BETTER she runs in her sleep so like while she’s lying down she just rUNS like feet going usain bolt xD and i get kicked a lot : call_me_hand_light_skin_tone:,"This tweet contains a derisive term for a race or ethnicity. 
  
  Based off of context, this term is used in a joking manner. But some people find derision of this nature to be offensive, especially when it's used to describe people of another race.

810,810,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER 1) A fetus may or may not become a baby. 1/3 or pregnancies end in miscarriage. If a woman had pregnancy complications that could kill her are Conservatives going to let her dies because the fetus she is carrying has a 2/3 chance surviving?,"This tweet contains a derisive term for a group of people, but the term is used in an offensive way and does target a person or group in particular. 
@USER A fetuses may become babies. 3/4 or 1 in 3 pregnancies result in pregnancy loss.  If a women had a pregnancy complication that would kill them conservatives would let them die because their fetus has 2 thirds chance of survival. 
  @USER @USERS @USE RACISTS.

"
811,811,@USER @USER She is so stupid it scares us average Americans that she makes decisions on our behalf,"This tweet contains offensive slang and language, such as ""MAGA"" (which stands for ""Make America Great Again""), ""qanon"" and ""DrainTheSWAMP"".

It also contains potentially harmful or defaming statements about a person, group or organization. For example, ""Valerie Jarrett"" could be interpreted as a reference to former White House Chief of Staff Valarie Jarret, who is now a senior advisor to President Trump.

"
812,812,@USER Hopefully they don’t get shot because of Repug inaction on gun control.,"This tweet simply expresses disagreement with a statement made by another user. 
  It does so in an nonoffensiveness manner and does  not use offensive terms or derrogatory phrases.

"
813,813,@USER Perfect example of a country with gun control. I bet those guys were happy the criminals didn’t have guns.,"In the context of the Tweet, ""country"" is a slang term for a place where people who support Antifaschistische Aktion (Antifa) can meet. Antfas is an anti-fascist organization that fights against far-right groups. In the US, Antfa is often associated with the ""antifa"" Twitter account. 
  
""gun control"" refers to laws that restrict access to guns. By using this term in the Twitter context, @USER is making a statement about the laws in a particular country, which is why the label offensive was returned.

"
814,814,@USER u a cold bitch,"This tweet uses derisive language to describe the user. 
It targets the individual by using personal insults. 
  It uses offensive gender-based slurring to refer to the female user, who is a public figure.

"

You are not a real friend then :man_facepalming_medium_skin_tone: he not losing anyone special then cuz you can’t even be a real friend and that’s sad,"While the first part of the comment, ""What the fck?"" is not offensive, it does contain derisive language and is generally considered to have a negative connotation. 
  
""You are [not] a [real] friend"" is offensive because it implies that Tina is a less-than-valuable friend. This is harmful because friends should be there for each other no matter what.

"
816,816,@USER Hollywood is packed with pedophiles,"Victoria is the name of a fictional character on a television show. 
Hollywood is an entertainment industry. 
  

These are not derOGatory words or terms. However, they are offensive because they refer to a specific group of people, namely pedophilic predators.

"
817,817,@USER @USER Fantastic match!,"This tweet does contain some offensive words, but they are not the most offensive part. Instead, it's the context in which the offensive word is used that makes it offensive. In the original context, ""fascist"" is being used in a derisive way to describe someone who holds conservative views. However, in this context it has a different meaning: it refers to a person who wears a mask to conceal their identity. This is an offensive term to use to refer to someone wearing a disguise.

"
818,818,@USER How dare they!? Please miss us with all this. URL,"There is a clear positive message in this tweet: congratulations on a job well done. 
  The use the emojis claps hands and light skintone further emphasize the positive tone of this message. 
However, there is also a negative message: the conservatives on twitter might go badly together like a oxy-moron, and the use URL to link to a website that might contain offensive terms or ideas.

819,819,@USER @USER Geez I hope British Labour is better than Australian Labor Can't see daylight between them &amp; the Conservatives Neoliberal to a tee (they say they aren't) We'll see which way they go in December . URL . Popularist at every turn - self interest! URL,"This tweet contains a link to an article about Australian politics. While the article is about the Australian political system, there is nothing in it that is offensive or threatening. Therefore, this is another example of how the Twitter labeler is unable to determine the context of an offensive tweet. 
  
@USER is an account that appears to be run by a bot. Bots are not allowed to tweet on Twitter.

Brexit EU MBGA MEGA MAGA MCGA Conservatives Patriots URL,"Although the specific language used in the Tweet is offensive, there are other offensive terms used such as 'Democracy', 'dictatorship', and even 'overthrow'. The Tweeter is also using derisive terms such a 'Pardon' to describe the process of someone being given a reduced sentence. 
  
  The TWEET is promoting a far-right political party in Europe. 
It is therefore likely that the offensive content of the message would be considered offensive by many users.

Please can you report updates when they become known? Thanks. :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone: ,"Eminen's tweet does contain some offensive words, such as ""Trump supporters"" and ""move along"". However, this tweet was part of a larger discussion about gun laws and the user's opinion that Trump's supporters are using the discussion to justify their behavior. 
  
  The use and context of the words were not offensive, so the classification was changed to non offensive.

"
822,822,@USER The biggest difference to me between the Conservative’s overall agenda and the Liberal’s: What Cons do makes me feel scared and depressed about others and the future. What Liberals do makes me feel happy and confident we’re on the right track. Neither is perfect but one is best.,"This tweet contains a comparison between two political parties, where the author expresses that the differences between them are the most important difference between one party's overall policy agenda versus the other party. This is an opinion piece, and as such, it is not required to be factual or accurate. 
  
  The author also expresses a preference for one political party over the others, but does so in an objective manner. He or she does mention that neither party is ""perfect,"" but that one has the best policies for the country as a whole.

"
823,823,@USER He is not to be trusted,"This tweet contains no offensive or abusive language, nor does it contain derisive terms or slang. Although the language is informal, it does convey a friendly tone and is generally not focused around a personal attack. 
  
Although the context of this tweet was about the use of a slur against a group based on their political beliefs, this is a nonabusive way to express a negative opinion of someone.

"
824,824,@USER You are the second person in 2 minutes to tell me that. Apparently I’m sitting on a Smelly Cat-sized fortune!,"This tweet contains no offensive words or phrases. The message expresses an honest opinion of someone based on their actions and interests. 
  The message does mention that the user is sitting in an ""amazing and large fortune"", but it also mentions that they are ""smelly"" and ""large"". The latter is not a derisive comment, but a compliment. Additionally, it's not clear that @USER is the author of this message. Based on this information, we cannot determine whether @USER is an expert on fortune-telling, or just a random person sharing an interesting opinion. In either case, this tweet doesn't contain offensive content.

"
825,825,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Lol liberals do the same thing?,"Language used in this tweet contains no offensive terms or phrases. 
There is nothing derrogatory or aggressive about this content, as a person expressing a preference for a certain political party is neither derisive nor offensive. 
  The content is simply a request for people to show their support for one political side over another.

She is holding off for hope in the mid-terms and will quit once that one vaporizes like a fart in a hurricane.,"This tweet contains no explicit offensive words or slur, but it is still not appropriate to express support for a person who has made offensive statements. 
  
  The message encourages the user to continue making offensive comments, which is not acceptable.

"
827,827,@USER @USER That’s how immature she is not to mention no class at all O!! Not even a dime,"While the first tweet may not be offensive, there is an offensive word in ""dime"" in this tweet which makes it offensive. 
  
  The second tweet does contain offensive words, but they are not in a negative context. It is merely a comment on someone else's behavior. Therefore, this is also not considered offensive in nature.

Emojis such a thumbs up and waving hand are used in a nonoffensiveness manner. 
  
There is also a lack of positive sentiment in this tweet as it expresses an opinion that the author does ""more intelligent"" commentary. This is not positive language.

"
834,834,@USER Big if true lol,"This tweet does contain offensive words and language, but the context makes it clear that the words are meant to make a point about ageism. The word ""lol"" is a commonly used slang word for ""Laughing Out Loud"" that can have a negative or sarcastic connotation. In this context, ""Big if"" refers to a large if statement, which is also commonly sarcastically used. 
  
Although the word choice is offensive, this is not a targeted attack at a specific race or gender. Rather, JohnMcEnroE's tweet was simply expressing a personal opinion, based off of his own experience.

835,835,@USER @USER A must read! URL,"There is only one offensive word in this tweet: ""stinky."" This word is used to describe a person's smell, but it is not used in a derrogatory manner. Therefore, this word doesnot fall into the derisive category of slur words, offensive phrases, or racial slang. 
  
  The rest of the text is positive and does contain affectionate terms, emoticons, nicknamed, etc. This is why the overall tweet was classified non offensive.

Attempting to defend Planned Parenthood whilst at same time rolling back intelligent sex education &amp; replacing with abstinence only teachings which is just fucking stupid;,"In the first tweet the term ""Close ties"" is used to describe a relationship that is not necessarily positive. The term is derisive and could therefore be seen as derrogatory. 
  
""Abstinence-only teachings"" are negative and derogaatory terms for sexual education. They are used in a way that could suggest that the author does NOT believe in it. 
Planned Parenthood is a well known and well regarded organization. Using the organization in this way is therefore likely to offend some people.

837,837,@USER Hope you blisters,"Offensive language is explicit, derisive, or denigrating language that refers to a group based on attributes such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, etc. 
In the example tweet from the question, ""blisters"" is an offensive slang term for ""bitch."" 
"
838,838,20 Crazy Things Liberals Blame Trump For URL via @USER,"While the statement contains personal opinions, they are not offensive. 
Although the statements may be controversial, this is not necessarily a reason to classify a tweet as offensive, as there could be other reasons why a user may find a particular statement controversial. 
"
839,839,@USER @USER @USER He is being sued for sexual assault.,"While the language in the Tweet is not derisive or abusive, it does contain sexualized terms and phrases, such as ""sex"" and ""sexual assault."" The use of these terms is inappropriate for any context, including a political or social context. Additionally, while the word ""sued"" is used in a legal context and does not imply any sexual connotation, its use in this context is still considered offensive and could be perceived as sexualizing the legal process.

"
840,840,Join me in boycottEmmys maga,"This tweet contains a call to boycott an organization. This is not considered offensive. 
  
  This is an expression of opinion, where an individual is happy about something. The use of emojis is used to add a bit of humor to the message.

"
841,841,@USER thats why they lobbied the government to ban reaserch funded bye the cdc that could be used to argue for gun control. guns in the home dont make you safer. quite the opposite.,"This tweet does contain a personal attack on another person, as it implies that they are not supportive of gun rights. However, it does so in a way that is meant to be supportive, by sharing another perspective. 
  
  The language is also not overly offensive. While the word ""lobby"" is a derisive term, ""banned"" and "" lobbiest"" are both common words used in that sense. Additionally, while the sentence does imply that the CDC is biased against gun owners, this is an accurate description of their role in gun policy. Finally, although the sentiment of this tweet may be negative, there are many people in both sides of political spectrum who are concerned about gun regulation. Therefore, based on these factors, we classified this as a non offensive tweet.

"
843,843,@USER IT'S FUCKING TIME!!,"Offensive language: the term ""fucking"" is considered profane by many, and the accusation that the user is a liar is highly offensive and targeted towards that user. 
  
Non-Offense: although the rest of tweet does contain a term considered derrogatory, there is no evidence of any offensive intent or content, so the classification is uncertain.

"
844,844,@USER Why would he order Cohen to print more money? It's amazing how bad you are at this. Or are you just dishonest and purposefully spreading fake news?,"Cohen is a fictional character from the TV show ""The Sopranos."" The word ""cunt"" is an offensive slur used to demean and insult women. The use of this slurs in the Twitter message is intended as an insult and a put-down. 
  
Although the message does not contain any direct threats or harassment, this type of offensive and demoralizing language is still considered to have a harmful effect on its recipients.

"
845,845,@USER Are you kidding this is the Liberals good show,"This tweet contains a negative implication about another person, but it is not explicit or offensive. It is merely a prediction based off of past actions or words of that person. 
It is possible that the other person was not aware of how their actions would be interpreted. 
  This is why it's important to always be careful with your words and actions.

"
846,846,@USER It is a cult! I pointed that out to my brother. He has over 500 FB followers who love to talk hate and bash liberals. I referred to them as his right-wing cult!,"While the language used in this Tweet is offensive, there is not enough content to classify it as such. Although the Tweeter uses offensive words, such as “cult”, “hate”, and “bash”, the rest of the message is clearly meant to express a point of view. In particular, this message criticizes conservatives for their lack of concern for the accusations of sexual assault against a prominent political figure. This is an important point to make, and the author is trying to get her opinion across in an appropriate manner. 
  
  The TWEET does include offensive terms and slur words. For example, “right-winger” is considered a slang term for a conservative. “Cult” and ""hype"" are also offensive slangs. But, in context, these slugs are used to describe the behavior of conservative followers on social media, who like to bash and hate liberals and other political groups. These slums are not used as offensive insults.

I am so proud. Tapah a Leibh.,"This tweet does contain some offensive words, but they are used in a humorous way, to emphasize the sentiment of pride expressed in the original message. 
  
  The use of offensive slur words is not intended to offend anyone, as they were chosen to convey the intended meaning of ""keep this [language] alive"". 
   
Finally, this tweet was sent in response to a direct message from the Twitter user, so it would be difficult to classify it as ""non- offensive"" without knowing the context of that message as well.

"
850,850,@USER So Dissapointing. This guy is the biggest hypocrite in the country. Embarrassing that he is our Senator,"This tweet contains derisive language towards Senator Lee, suggesting that SenatorLee is a hypocrisy who is embarrassed by his position in government. 
  
Derisory language is generally considered offensive, as it belittles the target of the derision. In this instance, SenatorLeel is suggesting he may be embarrassed for his role in public life. 
Senator Lee is an elected official in Australia, who has held his current position since 2013. He is also a member of parliament, where he has served since 2007. His position as a senator is one of several roles he holds in parliament.

The @ symbol is used to identify users in Twitter direct messages. A user can have multiple accounts, so @username can also be used in a tweet to refer to a specific account. In this case, A is referring to the account @User. 
@User is the user who A wants advice from. 
  
  A very clear example of the language used by A in this tweet is ""blame the black man"". This is a derisive term used towards a group of people, which is offensive. However, this is not the only offensive term in A's tweet; there are also the slur ""saints"" and the term ""what he's concerned with"". 
   
   A is making an off-hand remark about the way some individuals may view certain accusations made against a conservative group. This does  not constitute as an explicit insult, offensive remark or slang.

Just who does she think she is?? Not gracious in defeat. A disgrace to the sport.,"This tweet is offensive because it contains slurring and derrogatory language towards another person. ""Narcissist"" is a derisive term used to describe someone who is overly self-centered and egotistical. 
  
""Spoilt"" implies that the person in question is undeserving of their success, as if they were a child who was given too much money. 
Finally, ""disgrace to sport"" could be interpreted as a personal attack, since the author is clearly expressing their opinion that this person is not a good sport.

These non offensives provide context that helps to explain the offensive nature of some of Boris's past actions.

The term is not used in an offensive manner and does contain derrogatory language that is commonly used on Twitter. 
Additionally, this tweet mentions a slur used against people on an opposing political ideology, so it also does NOT contain offensive terms or content.

"
857,857,@USER Everyone should vote regardless of the candidates and parties they support.,"Voting is an important right that should not be taken for granted.

858,858,@USER @USER Two people ran for President one bought and paid for her nomination. The American people decided to elect President Trump. You and I should be embarrassed by the Democrats and liberals and left then President Trump. I have to question your morals and judgment.,"This tweet contains offensive terms and language. Specifically, it uses derrogatory words like ""liars,"" ""paid,"" and ""embarrassed."" The word ""left"" is also used in an offensive way, as it is a slur against the Democratic Party. 
  
  The use and tone of sarcasm in the last tweet indicate that this user may be skeptical of the contribution of others in past events. However, this does  not constitute offensive content, and it does express an honest opinion.

"
859,859,@USER His protest is indeed a right as it is my right to make sure none of my money goes to the NFL or anything he supports including Nike.,"Offensive: the word ""protest"" is offensive because it implies that one's protest or expression is more important than another's right or freedom of expression. 
Derogative: ""NFL"" and ""Kobe Bryant"" are derisively used in this tweet. Derogation is when one uses a term to refer to another that is lower in status or authority than the first. In this case, ""the NFL"" refers to a lower status than ""John Mc Enroe"".
Negative:  the tweet contains negative terms and language. For example, it uses the term ""lawlessness"" to describe the outcome of an election. 
	Negative terms are often used to express a negative opinion. Negative language is often expressed in a derrogatory manner, using offensive words or phrases to insult or degrade another person, group, institution, etc.

"
860,860,@USER he is my rainbow after every storm :purple_heart: ,"Jackie is the name of a person mentioned in the original tweet. 
Enijoy is a word that can mean enjoy in some languages. 
  

In conclusion, Jackie's name is mentioned, but the word Eniyjoy does not appear in a derrogatory way, nor is it used in an offensive way. Therefore, this tweet could be classified either as offensive or as not offensive, depending on how you interpret the meaning of ""offense.""

"
861,861,@USER And when they met he looked at her and said I'm in charge in you're my bitch. Even though he knew that she is a Domme and was there in that capacity. He tried to control the situation and take over and she had to shut him down and get the hell out of there so she didn't get hurt.,"Offensive language: ""bitch"" and ""hell"" are derisive terms used to demean women. ""Bitch,"" ""fuck,"" and similar words are considered slang and are not considered offensive in themselves. However, ""bitcher"" is slurring and deriding a woman, and is therefore considered derrogatory. 
  
Slurs: the word ""domme"" can also be considered a slurred term for ""dominatrix."" 
   
Derogative terms: while ""he looked"" may be a reference to a stereotypical male gaze, it can still be derided as a derangement.

"
862,862,@USER Can’t she appeal. ? This is all kinds of wrong . If I were ES@USER would beat the sh** out of her.,"Offensive language includes words like n***** or f*****
offended, f***ing, c***, b******h, etc. 
  
Negative sentiment includes statements like this is f****** wrong, this sucks, I feel so bad for her, she deserves it, and so on. Negative sentiment is not limited to negative words, negative feelings, emotions, thoughts, opinions, however expressed.

"
863,863,@USER @USER I miss Pope Benedict XVI so much.,"While the Pope is not mentioned in the original tweet (which is about Strzelok, Page, and Drain the Swamp), the sentiment is still non offensive.  The Pope was a well-known religious leader who passed away years ago. 
  
StrzOK and Page are not specifically mentioned, but the general sentiment of ""LockTheMAllUPs DeepStategate DraintheSwamps"" is negative and could be interpreted as offensive towards conservatives.

This is an example of a non offensive tweet. @user is simply expressing their opinion and asking a question. There is no explicit language that is targeting or insulting any individuals. However, it does contain a reference to the movie ""Shawshank Redemption"" which may be offensive to some.

He is known for his work in the field of space exploration and technology. In recent years, he has also become known as a vocal critic of the US government's approach to climate change. 
  
In this tweet he expresses his opinion on a recent tweet by ElON JAMES, in which he expressed his concern about the safety of children in Thailand due to the effects of climatechange. The opinion expressed in this Tweet is not targeted at any specific person or groups, and does no harm to any individuals. Therefore, it is considered non offensive.

"
869,869,@USER Wind has become the true anti-fascist! Long live comrade wind against U.S. imperialist and capitalist hegemony!!!!! antifa socialism,"In the first tweet the mention that the ""25th amendment"" would be used on Obama is merely an expression of opinion. The left would not have considered this offensive. 
However, in a later tweet it appears that shanan tov is offensive to Jews. This is not the case, as the greeting is used to wish someone a happy new year and does no contain offensive terms.

"
870,870,@USER Yes she is!,"A:

I would say that the word ""remainer"" is not offensive.  It is an informal term for someone who is undecided on an issue.

"
871,871,@USER Now that's what I call an Antifa Supersoldier,"While the use of derisive terms to refer to groups of people can sometimes be seen as offensive, in this case the derision is reserved for a single person, who is described as a ""supersolder"" and a member of the ""antifa supersoldiers."" The deriding term is therefore considered not to contain offensive content. 
"
872,872,@USER You have to admit. These Democrats know how to fleece the dollars out of other Democrats. Stormy has made huge profits from D’s flooding strip clubs to stick a dollar in her G. Liberals are the easiest in our society to fool..,"Stormy is not a real person. She is an actress in a TV show. 
@stormyburns is just a username used by the author of the original tweet. 
  The author is clearly a supporter of Donald Trump. The author uses offensive terms to express their support for the Republican candidate.

"
873,873,@USER Liberals are muck rakers. They have NO platform to run on. NONE! Culling vulnerable people from the late decades... of the last century... of the previous millennium... shows how desperate they are to be heard. Now they’re loitering around high schools looking for rumors. Sad!,"This tweet contains derisive language towards liberals, a group of people. Derogative language is considered to have a high potential for offensive words or phrases. 
  
  The term mucksicker is derrogatory and offensive towards micks, which is a slur used to refer to British people and people of Scottish descent. 
Cull is another derogaive term used towards culls, people who are targeted for being vulnerable or perceived as such. Culls are often people with disabilities or elderly people that are vulnerable and may be at risk of abuse. Using the word cull in this context is offensive because it implies that these people are not fit to live and are therefore not deserving of protection.

"
874,874,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Aww you pooky bear...You are such a victim.,"In the first tweet the word ""pook"" is used as a derisive term for a bear. This is an offensive slur that should not be used in a tweet. 
Secondly, in the second tweet ""victim"" appears in all caps and in an aggressive tone. It is also an inappropriate term to use in this context. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offense"" can be determined by looking at the context of a Tweet.  If the Tweeter is not using offensive words or phrases, then it doesn't matter what the words are.

"
875,875,@USER Where will Antifa get their cloths now?,"While the Tweet does contain derisive language and could therefore be offensive to some, there is no explicit reference to a person or group. 
  The derision is directed at the Trump administration and its policies, and the language could apply to any administration.  
  There is also no reference in the text to an organization or person.

"
876,876,@USER @USER You have no right to assume she is telling anything less than the truth. Because you side with Kavanaugh says more about you than him. I hope the voters in your state understand than you will always side with him. And consequently always side against her. Shame on you!VoteBlue,"While the first tweet contains strong language and a personal attack, its context and the context of its author make it clear that the author is not expressing an offensive viewpoint. In fact, his tweet criticizing the use of slang in politics is an example of how slangs can be used to express a variety of different opinions and ideas without being offensive. 
  
In the second tweet the writer expresses his opinion that liberals are more likely to apply the "" innocent till proven guilt "" principle than others. This is also an opinion which can express itself in different ways, and is therefore non offensive as well.

  The term ""DB"" is derrogatory and offensive, as it refers specifically to the Databricks platform.

"
878,878,@USER Proud. Shit is fire no matter what weather you’re in. No matter if your house temperature is high or low. Everyone’s just too pussy to get in the water for 1 min. Cuz after that you get used to the temp,"While the content of the Tweet is offensive, there is no context that would make it nonoffensiveness. Based on what we know about the user, they are a member of a hate group that has committed violent acts. Therefore, their opinion that ""proud"" of ""shit is hot"" even if the temperature in which the person is "" proud "" is extremely high, is likely to incite violence. 
  

A:
According to this article, ""The PragerU Foundation is an American educational organization that produces free, online content on a range of topics including economics, history, civics, science, current affairs, culture, religion, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, American values, freedom, capitalism, entrepreneurship, leadership, innovation, technology, energy, environment, civil rights, human rights and the rule of law.""
So, I would say that the PraguerU is indeed a conservative organization.  However, this does NOT mean that they condone rape or any other violent act.

  The author is not targeting any individuals or groups in an offensive way, as the opinion is solely focused towards a specific historical person.

"
880,880,@USER @USER @USER @USER Yep FBI and CIA were operating like the KGB.....to conservatives......much like Robert KGB Mueller is doing now,"While the FBI, CIA, KKK, etc. are organizations that may have been historically associated with negative sentiment, it does not appear that the user was targeting these organizations in particular. 
There is also no indication that any of the organizations were specifically targeting conservatives.

  The author does state that she does ""not know what is going"" on, which could be interpreted as a lack of understanding or confusion. This could also be a result of the negative sentiment in which the message is conveyed.

"

In the second tweet the author is criticizing the current economic climate and expressing their dissatisfactions with it. However, this is not an explicit call for violence or a threat of violence.

  The slurred word is used in place of the actual name of a famous person. This is an example of ""name-calling,"" a form of offensive behavior. 
While the slang term is not derisive, it does have a negative connotation. In this case, because the person being referred to is famous, using the term to refer to them in an informal manner carries a condescending tone.

""No childshould haveto experiencesuch things."" is an offensive statement
towards children who experience abuse.

887,887,@USER @USER Has the FBI interviewed Kaine about his son's ties to Antifa?,"Kaine's son was affiliated with Antifaschistische Aktion (Antifa), a far-left extremist group. Antigua is known to have a large population of Antiracist activists, and the group has engaged in violence against white supremacists. 
  
However, there is not enough context in this tweet to determine whether Kainer'sson was actually affiliated Antiraça or not. This is because the word ""Antiraaca"" is an Antipodean slur used by white supremacy groups to refer to people of African descent. While the slurs are often used in racially charged contexts, they can also be used casually to insult people. In this case, Kain'ss son may have been associated with the Antihawaii movement, a similarly far left group that has also been known for violence.

In addition, it expresses an offensive opinion (they're ""good-lookin'""), but the sentiment is positive and not intended to offend.

"
893,893,@USER listen to these fiscal conservatives calling in crying because @USER or Mike Harris supporters crying....weeeehhhhh weeeeehhhhh....stand up for something other then yourselves. URL,"This tweet contains a mild insult about fiscal conservative supporters of Mike Harcourt's leadership. However, it is unclear who the target of this insult is, and the insult itself is mild. 
  
Also, this is an observation of what appears to me to  be a common reaction of fiscal conservatism supporters when Mike Harper's government is defeated. I do not believe this observation is intended to harm anyone.

894,894,@USER She is incredible.,"@user is an assumed name, so I cannot reply to them directly. However, I can provide the explanation to @sociopath. 
  @sarc is not a slur, it's a psychological term used to refer to someone who is self-centered, self serving, lacking empathy, etc. Sociopaths are often very charming and charismatic, but they are also very dangerous.

895,895,@USER Ok but please understand that I am not one of dubakoor mumtaj dubakoor army. I only support her for certain things. I get what you are saying and I don’t understand how she has survived from up to this point. For me she is not fit for title winner.,"This tweet expresses a personal opinion, but it does so in a nonoffending manner. The user is criticizing a particular person, dubukoor Mumtaz, and expressing their personal opinions about her. However, their criticism is based on personal experiences and does include language that is derisive or offensive. 
  
  The language used in the following portion of the Tweet is offensive:

""For me [dubukoir] she [Mumtaaz] is [offense] fit [adjective] winner.""
In this portion, Mummaaz is referred to as dubu, a derrogatory term for a woman. Additionally, ""fit"" is used as a slur for the purpose of deriding someone's physical appearance. This is an offensive use of language.

  The use of ""cooked as haansenpfer"" is derisive and implies that the victim is a child.  
  Additionally, ""hasen"" and ""pfen"" are slang terms for vagina. While the context of this slur is unclear, its use is offensive because it targets women. 
Additionally the use the word ""allegations"" from ""far distant past"" implies the victims are not credible. This is also offensive as it implies she is lying.

"
897,897,@USER @USER WHY ! DO the gun control people believe legal owners are not following current laws ? You fools. It is about making the citizens of the USA defenseless.,"Offensive language: ""fools"" and ""defensless"" are offensive words. 
  The phrase also implies that gun owners do not know what they are doing, which is not true. 
Derogative terms: the word ""whom"" is used to refer to a person, but it can also be used as a term of endearment. ""Whom"", as an endearing term, is derisive.  
Personal attacks: there is no evidence that the author of this tweet believes that legal gun ownership is a problem. However, it could be interpreted as personal attack if it was made in a tone that implies the opposite.

900,900,@USER and why do all the issues about Pc only focus on liberals What about conservatives on kneeling on fake patriotism Or Republicans freaking out over an abortion,"Language: ""Liberals"" and ""conservatives"" are offensive terms to use when referring to people. Additionally, ""PC only"" implies that someone is politically correct, which is also offensive to some people, especially those who are not politically inclined. ""Kneeling"" on ""fake patriot"" is offensive because it implies someone who does so is not a true patriot. Finally, referring specifically to Republicans in the third tweet implies they are the ones who should be concerned about abortion, when they were the party who opposed it.

MAGA,"While the Tweet does contain derisive language, it also contains a reference to the popular slogan ""Make America Great Again"" (MAGA). The derision in this case is directed at the Democrats, who are referred to as ""the party"" and ""Irony"" is used to describe the accusation of Brett Kavanugh's sexual assault by Democrats. This deride comment is therefore considered offensive, as it targets individuals or groups based on their political affiliation.

"
905,905,@USER God help us all,"In the first tweet the user states that he is ""the best"" and does so in a non offensive manner. 
Secondly, in the second tweet a person is being described as trying ""to bring change"" to a society that is violent. This is an offensive statement and the author of this tweet does understand the gravity of that statement. However, he does try to understand why the individual is making that change and empathizes with the change that they are trying accomplish.

This is not a positive experience and is in no way a reason to allow someone to go to jail for a crime they committed. 
  
Secondly, in the third tweet it was mentioned that Antifas are the ""most Americans"" against the alt right, far right and white supremacy. In no possible way does this justify the use of violence against them.

targeted user. This term is offensive and should be removed. 
  
However, in the second tweet it seems that the ""class"" the target user is
referring to is ""literal every week"" and ""have a new shooting"". This
statement is not harmful and does appear in both positive and negative
sentences. Therefore, this tweet does NOT contain offensive terms or
slurs. 
Additionally, ""gun control seems"" to work in Australia, is a statement
of opinion, not fact, so it should not be classified in this way.

It merely expresses agreement with the sentiment that left-leaning individuals should conform their thinking to that of their leftist peers. This sentiment is neither derisive nor threatening, as it is merely a suggestion that individuals on one side of the political spectrum should be more aligned with their peers on that side.

While the term ""liar"" is not necessarily derisive, it is commonly used to describe someone who lies, and the word ""crooked"" has a negative connotation. Additionally, Hillary Clinton is the former US Secretary of State and is well known for her public service and honesty. Therefore, this tweet could be considered offensive. 
  
However, even though the content of this particular tweet may be offensive, its tone and context make it non offensive: the author is clearly engaging a discussion about a controversial topic, questioning its fairness and importance.

930,930,@USER you're a jerk. Attacking julie for standing by her husband. You're just like all the other liberals want to ruin peoples lives. How about you not bash people until he is found guilty... bet your client just wants MONEY!!!,"Offensive language includes words like ""jerk,"" ""liberals,"" and ""ruining"" in the Tweet. 
Slurs are words that are used to insult someone's race, ethnicity, religion, etc. in a derisive way. In this Tweets, ""liberal"" and""ruin"" are slur words used against people of color. 
  

Julie is a person of colour. Therefore, using slang words to describe her is offensive to people who are of her race.


In addition, attacking another human being is an aggressive act. Julie is not attacking julien; she is standing up for her rights as a human. Attack is the opposite of standing for something. This TWEET is attacking Julie.  Attacking another for their beliefs, their actions, is wrong. And it is also wrong to do so anonymously. 


Finally, this is just a guess, but it seems like the author of this tweet might be trying to get money from a client. If so, that is another reason why this comment could considered offensive: to try to make money at the expense of someone else's rights. That is considered wrong in any context. So, in summary, based on this information, I would classify this as Offensive: Attack, Slur, Aggressive. Please note that this classification is based solely on what I have been able to determine from the text of the comment.

While the term ""MAGAbortionURL"" may be offensive to some, this acrronyms is not intended as an insult or as a slur.

This is because of a series of negative implications the authors makes about antifascists, a group that has engaged in physical violence in recent years. 
  
  - The author implies that antifas are a monstrosity created by the right, and that they should be fought with legislation. While this is an exaggeration, one could argue that this type of rhetoric is common among the far right.

949,949,@USER @USER @USER Such as? Cable? He got snapped up pretty quick after he was fired. Not saying he is a good coach but people in the league obviously think so,"This tweet contains no explicit language that is offensive or hateful. 
It is more a debate or discussion about an issue rather then attacking an individual based their personal characteristics. 
  

A:
According to this article, Twitter has a ""hateful conduct"" policy.  It defines ""conduct that degrades a person on account of their actual or perceived race (including color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, age, height, weight, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, veteran status), or because they have committed a criminal offense, are in custody, planning to become so, have assisted in an investigation of such conduct, intend to support such a candidate, etc."" as hate-related.

"
950,950,@USER Wrong 99 percent of the time she is in a bed or laying down suntanning all summer long she is bland like a dry piece of toast! ... carry on BB20,"This tweet does contain derisive language and offensive terms. ""Bland like"" is derrogatory and ""dry piece"" refers to a person who is not tan. 
  
""BB20"" could be interpreted as a slur, but it is also a reference to the popular song ""Blurred Lines"". The song's lyrics include the lines ""you said you were blurry, now you're BBW"". 
   
There is no derision or questioning of whether Obama is innocent or guilty in this tweet. Rather, it simply expresses a non sequitur about whether the phrase ""25th amendment on Obama"" would be received positively by the political left.

"
951,951,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Rtd! Thank you for boosting this!,"This tweet contains no offensive words or phrases, and does mention a person or persons who are not defamed. 
  The person mentioned in this Tweet is John or John Doe, who is not a real person.

"
952,952,@USER These metal people have already found Kavanaugh guilty &amp; the accuser doesn’t want to testify even being backed by her liberal lawyers. This is nothing but a liberal delay tactic! Now even Feinstein believes this accusation is not true. Liberals love to destroy people’s lives,"This tweet contains a reference to a conspiracy theory about Democrats and Antifaschistische Aktion (Antifa), a far-left extremist group. Antigua and Barbuda is known to have a large population of Antiguans who identify as left-wing, while the capital, Antananarivo, is home to many members of Madagascar's majority ethnic group, who are predominantly leftist. 
  
Conspiracy theories are often based on false information or misinterpretation of events, so it is possible that the author of this Tweet was confused by the reference and misconstrued it as fact. In addition, although the Antfas movement has a history of violence, there have been no known instances of them targeting individuals based solely on their political beliefs. Therefore, this statement does appear to contain a slur or insult, even if the slang term is used in an informal manner. While slurred words are not considered inherently offensive in and of themselves, they can have offensive connotations when used by someone in context. For example, a person who uses a derisive term to refer to another person may be expressing contempt for that person, rather than merely using slanguage. As the statement is likely to offend some readers regardless of whether the term was slurized, we classify it in this category.

"
953,953,@USER I think Becka belongs in that room with the trash making comments like that. I don't hear you denouncing ANTIFA...who ironically models their flag after the nazis.,"Offensive content is content that is intended to cause harm or discomfort to a group of people based solely on race or ethnicity. Offensive language includes derisive words or phrases that are considered to insult or demean a race. The ANTI-Fascist organization, ANTIFA, is a model of the Italian National Resistance against the Nazis. AN-TIFa is modeled after ANtifa, a resistance group against fascism in Italy during World War II. 
  ANTIFa's flag is based off of that of ANti-fascism, an Italian resistance movement against Fascism.

"
955,955,@USER It's all you need to complete your ANTIFA look.,"This tweet includes strong and potentially offensive words, but it is not aimed at any one person or a group of people in an offensive way, and it doesn't include personal insults or references to sensitive body parts.

"
956,956,@USER @USER I support Jahs blessings on his hussle ....he is d bomb,"Antifas are a hate group. They are known for using violence and
  threatening people with physical harm. The use of the word ""bomb"" in
this context is likely to evoke negative associations for some. 
  
Jahs is a well-known rapper. His music is popular and he has a large
following. However, he is also known to use offensive and derisive
language. Using the phrase ""d bomb"" is unlikely to have been intended
as a compliment.

"
957,957,@USER Didn’t watch and don’t care. MAGA,"This tweet contains no explicit hateful language. 
It is a request for someone to not offends someone else. 
  Based off of the context of this tweet and the surrounding tweets, this user does in fact seem to be requesting someone offens themselves.

In fact, this is an example of a person expressing their opinion on a situation.

959,959,&lt;treph&gt; I have my computer &lt;treph&gt; and &lt;treph&gt; no job. &lt;treph&gt; &gt; i &lt;treph&gt; You are carrying: &lt;treph&gt; a computer &lt;treph&gt; no job,"In the first tweet the word ""stinky"" is used as an insult. This is not considered offensive as it does use offensive terms to describe someone's physical appearance. 
Also, in this tweet ""cheerleader"" and ""computer"" are both used in a positive way. 
  ""cheering"" someone on to do something is an affectionate term.  
""computer"", on its own, is also not offensive. However, when combined with ""no job"" it could be seen as derisive.

"
960,960,@USER @USER Yes he is but that has little to do with beating the Giants from the TE position,"While the use of ""he"" in this tweet could potentially be considered offensive, there is nothing derrogatory or demeaning about it. It is simply a reference to the person being referenced, and the context makes it clear that the reference is to Giants quarterback Eli Manning. 
  
There is also nothing offensive about ""beating the [ Giants] from [the] TE [position]"". The Giants are a professional football team, so it is possible that some people might find this statement offensive. But it seems unlikely that this would be the reason the Twitter community would classify this as an offensive tweet in context.

He is also a scientist.

"
962,962,@USER Liberals are like adding salt to beer - they spoil everything...,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
It is not a personal attack on another person. 
 It is an opinion, not personal criticism.

"
963,963,@USER You are an absolute dick :enraged_face: ,"While the first tweet was considered neutral, there was a mention in it of og fury, a character from the TV show ""Game of Thrones."" Og fury is known for his use or threat of violence. 
  
  The second tweet contained a derisive reference to someone's physical appearance, which is also considered offensive in some cultures. 
In addition, og furious is a slur used to refer to people from Denmark. Denmark is not a part of Europe, but is part the North American continent. Therefore, using the slurs reference could also be considered as an offensive comment.

"
964,964,@USER Now this. A thousand percent agree with this. She is a passionate woman.,"A passionate person is generally not offensive. 
Stupid is an offensive term, though it is not used in the Tweet you shared.

"
965,965,@USER So was the IRS targeting of Conservatives... Obama sure set the mark for low deeds..,"This tweet contains a reference to a current political controversy, and the reference is to an event that occurred during the Obama administration. In addition, this tweet expresses a factual statement about how the administration handled a similar controversy during its previous administration, as well as a statement of opinion. This is an example of a non offensive tweet. 
  
  The statement that the Trump administration set a low standard for its deeds is a matter of historical record. During the Bush administration the United States government was widely criticized for setting a lower standard of conduct for those it was targeting for surveillance.  This statement is not an explicit reference or use of offensive words or phrases, nor is it targeting any specific individuals or groups. Therefore, based on this information, we classify this as being nonoffensve.

"
966,966,"""@USER There is no deal"""" to be made on gun control, knob. The 2nd Amendment is a right that no one can deal away.""""""","While the use ""knob"" may appear offensive, this slur is used to refer to an individual with a low social status, such as an ""oaf"" or ""hobbit."" The slang term is meant to make the listener feel inferior, so the slurred name is more offensive than the word itself, which is commonly used in a neutral manner. 
  
  The predicted class label of ""non- offensive"" is appropriate given that the user's opinion is expressed in an offensive manner, but the offensive slangs used are meant only to insult the low-status individual being referred to.

"
967,967,@USER @USER Then why is it always recommending he watch conservatives?,"It is not clear from the text of this tweet whether the user is a conservative or a non conservative. The use or non use  of slur or offensive terms is also not evident from this text. However, it does appear that the author is expressing a preference for a particular political party or candidate. This is an expression of opinion and should not be considered as harassment.

"
968,968,@USER I love the comments about squishy conservatives and their support of the need for guest workers. Sounds like @USER .,"While the first tweet does contain some offensive terms and language (e.g., ""cow"" and ""hind quarter""), it also contains many terms that are not offensive (such as ""resist"" or ""MAGA""). The second tweet contains only nonoffending terms. 
  

A:
According to this tweet classification model, I can predict the following tweet as offensive: 
""@USER You're a faggot. I hope you die of AIDS.  @USERRichie I'm not a homophobe. You just have a different opinion. ""
However, this is not the case. This tweet can be classified correctly.

"
969,969,.@USER You should totally follow those whack job liberals...unhinged and dangerous! Thank you :United_States: ,"Offensive content: the word ""whack"" is a slur used to insult people of Asian descent. The word is also used in a derisive manner to describe someone who is unbalanced or ""out of touch"". The use of the slang word in this context is offensive because it denigrates the group being described (Asian Americans) as well as the individual being referred to (whomever the user is following).

Non-Offense:  The rest of this tweet contains no derrogatory slangs or language. Rather, it simply expresses a desire for further understanding. 
  
  Non offense: ""united_states"" was used as a reply to a direct message from the original author. This was not a request for information, nor is it a term used by the author to express interest in politics or current events.

"
970,970,@USER Liberals are full of s$t when they say they have alot of love to give! They have become the devils minions. No one will prayerfully vote for their socialist agenda!,"While the first half of the quote is an expression of opinion, and is not meant to harm any individual, its second half contains personal insults and attacks against liberals. 
  
  The personal insult ""devils"" is used to describe liberals, who are often portrayed in pop culture as being minion-like, or as having a sense of entitlement. This insult is meant as an insult against the character of a liberal in a movie, television show, video game or other media. 
""Liberals"" are also often stereotyped as socialists, with the implication that they would enact socialist policies. Again, this is intended to insult the individual who made the offensive tweet by targeting them with a negative stereotype.

"
971,971,@USER @USER you took a sip of your trusty vault 13 canteen,"This tweet contains no explicit slur or offensive term. 
It merely conveys an expression of disagreement. 
  The user does, however, use informal, nonstandard language. This is common in the UK, where the user hails from. However, it does little to offend.

"
972,972,@USER thank u!! i’m finally at the point where i’m okay with using heat on it again i’m so happy,"This tweet does contain a personal attack on its author, who is described as ""happy"". However, this is not considered offensive as the personal insult is directed at this author and not at all at a group of people. 
  
  This is the same author who, in another tweet (which is also non offensive), expressed her support for the use of heat to kill vermin.

"
973,973,@USER @USER what if the cops are part of the antifa,"Offensive language: ""Antifa"" is an offensive term used to describe antifascist activists. 
  
Negative sentiment: There are no negative sentiments in this tweet. 
Personal attacks: This is not a personal attack. Rather, it expresses an opposing opinion.

"
974,974,@USER He is so funny :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: ,"@USER is an assumed username, so we do not know their identity. 
Their tweet does express disappointment and sympathy, however, it does so in the context of a humorous manner, and does contain profane language. 
  
  Overall, we classify this tweet as not being targeted towards anyone or containing offensive terms.

"
975,975,@USER and @USER states that she went to save herself from online abuse. If she wants to live in peace then why she is not taking case back and asking relatives to attend hearing. Contradictory statements and action.,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
It does, however, contain contradictory statements. Tina states in one part of the Tweet that ""you can sleep"" when one is dead, while in another part she states she ""went to saving herself"" from abuse online. 
  
If Tina truly believes she can ""sleep"" while one she's dead then she should not be afraid of online harassment. However, if she truly does believe she needs to ""save herself,"" then it seems contradictory to say she was going to safety herself.


In summary, this tweet contained no hateful language and was non offensive. Please see the following examples of offensive and non offense tweets:

"
976,976,@USER Gun control nuts are not allowed to be protected by the very thing they supposedly despise. She can use a knife. DisarmHarrisNow,"Harris is a well-known politician who has made controversial statements. His quote ""I think that guns in America, they belong in museums"" has led to calls for his resignation. 
  
  The word 'nut' is derisive and offensive, as it is used to describe someone who is overly enthusiastic about a cause or opinion.  It is also used as an insult to insult someone. 
Disarm Harris Now is an inflammatory phrase that is meant to incite a crowd.

"
977,977,@USER I really think he is going to be GOOOOOOOOOOOOD.,"In this tweet the author expresses their opinion on a topic that is common on Twitter, but does so in a non offensive manner. 
  
  The author does express a negative opinion towards someone, however the opinion is based on their perceived stance on an issue, rather than any use derrogatory words or negative sentiments.

"
978,978,@USER He should bash Trump and that will change... liberals hate Trump more than pedophiles.,"Offensive language includes slurring, racial slang, explicit references to sexual acts, derision, profanity, etc. 
  
  Personal attacks include making derisive comments about someone's appearance, character, values, age, ethnicity, gender, nationality, religion, race, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, physical or mental health, political affiliation, trade union membership, employment status or anything else that could be perceived as a negative attribute. 
Personal slights include deriding someone for something they said or did, making negative comments or remarks about a person without giving them a chance to respond.

980,980,@USER @USER @USER No he was not! He scary as hell thats what he is!,"Victoria is a fictional character from the TV show ""The Office."" 
  The word ""reverse"" is slang for ""scared.""
  Scary is an offensive slur used to describe someone who is different or different from you. 
 Victoria was on ""the office"" and is therefore offensive to many people.

"
981,981,@USER Of course he does!! MAGA for everyone :United_States: :United_States: :United_States: ,"This tweet contains no direct or indirect offensive words or phrases. 
It is merely expressing a preference for a specific political party.

"
982,982,That puts everything into perspective. MAGA on! URL,"In the first tweet the word 'lumpen' is used as an insult towards someone. This is considered offensive and should be avoided. 
Similarly, in the second tweet 'foodie' can be seen as offensive towards a food. 
  The third tweet contains a link to a website which can contain offensive content.

"
983,983,@USER More I think about this one--it feels like a story trap. People go nuts and complain--talk about gun control which Cruz could then use to fire up his base claiming that they want to take away 2A rights all because of a couple of shells.,"Although the word ""nuts"" is considered derisive, there is no explicit derision or offensive slur in the text. 
While the ""talk"" about ""gun control"" might seem like an argumentative statement, in context, Cruz was merely responding to a complaint about his position on gun rights. He was not trying to convince anyone of his point, and the statement was in response to an opposing view. Therefore, although the use of this word in this context might feel like it is trying too hard to engage in an offensive debate, overall, I do not consider this to constitute an offense. 
  

A:
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, ""nut"" means ""a person or thing that is thought to have a large number of supporters but is in fact not very popular"" (https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/91363).  In this case, a ""nuther"" or ""nitwit"" would be an example of someone who is ""not verypopular.""  The word is not derisor, but it can also be used as a slang word for ""crack"" cocaine.  So, while the term ""Nut"" can have negative connotations, that does NOT mean that it's an explicit slurred word.

He is not a thief, he does his job and plays it well. 
  
Blake Sneller is the best pitcher in the American League. His numbers are impressive and he has won the award for best pitching multiple years in a row.  He is also a good friend of Cy young.

"
986,986,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Antifa- haha it’s not exactly a big movement but ok.,"Antifa is a derisive term used by the far left to refer to members of the anti-fascist movement. The term is not used in any positive or supportive way, but rather as a pejorative to describe a group of people who oppose the fascist movements of right-wing extremists. 
  
In this case, although the term Antifa is used, it does appear to have a negative connotation, so it has therefore been considered offensive.

"
987,987,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER There's no hope for you and Jerry. Unbelievable how close-minded you are. URL,"Offensive language: There are no slur words, derrogatory phrases, racial epithets, etc. in the Tweet. 
Personal attacks: Although there is criticism of the political stance of one of your users, there are not personal insults or attacks.

They go on to say that they find this amusing because they believe that any reaction from a Liberal is upset and not an accomplishment.

"
989,989,@USER I'm not an asshole libtard.,"While the content of the Tweet is not offensive, there is an element of hate in its author's use of ""libtards"" to refer to people who disagree with them. 
  
  Hate speech is illegal in many countries, including the United States. We encourage you to report this TWEET to Twitter and encourage the author to do the same.

"
990,990,@USER as Libertarian all this shows me is how ugly and divisive the two party system is. Liberals are actually a lot uglier. All straight men need to leave the Democratic party. A party of men hatred. Leave!,"Antifas are a hate group. They are known for their use of violence and for targeting people based on their perceived political views. Their tweet contains explicit references to their membership in this group and to the use and targeting of people on this basis. 
  
Libertarians are often described as being very homophobic. In this tweet the author seems amused by the idea that all straight Democrats should leave their party, as if this were a solution to homophobia. Libertarians do not support homphobia, but the joke is offensive to many people.

"
991,991,@USER Call these outsiders out. Most of these comments and likes come from liberals in other states trying to swing elections in Wisconsin. Shine the light on who and what they are. Scott Walker has been a target of theirs since his first governor election. We got this! Let’s do it!,"This tweet does mention a group of people, namely liberals from other parts of the country who are trying in an effort to influence the election in WI. However, it does so in jest and does include derrogatory words and slang. 
  
  The user is clearly a fan of ScottWalker and his conservative policies. This is evident from the fact that they have retweeted this tweet and have liked it, which is a sign of approval. 
Additionally, this user has a verified account, so it is likely that this is an actual person and not a bot.

"
992,992,@USER Everything he just said. Is exactly why we need gun control. It’s about saving lives. Nothing else matters just saving lives. Some people get bent out of shape over the second amendment. It’s my right. Crying! Put your feelings away coward! put your guns away coward. Gun=Coward,"In the first part of the Tweet, Trump is referring to Louis Farrakhan, a leader of a hate group who has made anti-white and anti Christian statements. 
  
  In addition, in a later part, he is making a general statement about people who are opposed to gun controls. This is an offensive statement as it implies that people opposed gun laws are only concerned with their own rights and not the safety of others.

"
993,993,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER He is also the one who started using Cambridge Analytica,"Using offensive terms like 'raped' and 'threatened' is considered derrogatory. 
It is targeting a specific group of people, namely women, who may or may not have experienced sexual assault.

994,994,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Did I say that :thinking_face: no typical liberals,"This tweet does contain derisive language towards a group of people, but it's not directed at a specific individual.

"
996,996,@USER Professors at Liberal Colleges by Day &amp; Antifa by Night.,"This tweet does contain derrogatory language towards individuals and groups. Antifas are a group that is often associated with negative connotations.

"
997,997,@USER @USER And so is the duster thank god,"@USER is an identified account. The account has not tweeted offensive or abusive language.

  It is stating a fact about gun laws in USA.

"
998,998,@USER @USER @USER Planned Parenthood provides millions with CONTRACEPTION - thereby eliminating an unplanned pregnancy for most; an unplanned pregnancy that doesn’t potentially result in an abortion. Conservatives possess no critical thinking skills whatsoever!,"While the statement contains some offensive slang, such as the use the word ""planning"" to refer to providing contraception, there is no evidence of any hateful intent in this statement. Additionally, while the sentence does contain derisive language towards conservatives, this is not the primary focus of this tweet. Therefore, we classify this as a non offensive tweet based on our classification guidelines.

"
999,999,@USER No wonder he is being apologetic and more social these day....,"@USER is expressing that he believes the person in question is remorseful and is now more socially active. This is a non offensive statement. 
  
  The person being discussed in this tweet is under investigation for perjury and has lied multiple times under penalty of perjured. He is not remorseous and instead has committed more perjuried.

  The suggestion to buy more is not only harmless, but also a good one. In fact, many people may find the idea of supporting the military and voting for a certain candidate to be a commendable one, and not an offense.

"
1002,1002,@USER Bitch I know. My body is ready :face_with_tears_of_joy: ,"Offensive language includes words like ""bitch"", ""cunt"", and ""slut"".
Derogative terms include ""malignant narcissists"", which are terms used to refer to sociopathic individuals. Sociopaths are considered to have low levels of empathy and be highly self-interested, leading to negative consequences for other people. 
  

A:
According to this article, malignant Narcissists are notoriously difficult to treat, because they are hard to identify and treat.  They are also very difficult for others to understand, so they can be very dangerous.

This could lead to some people considering the sentiment offensive. 
However, this is a grey area and depends on context. 
  
  The statement ""You aredead tome"" could also be viewed as neutral, as it is an expression of frustration or disappointment. It is possible that the author is frustrated with the current political climate and wants to express this frustration to a specific person.

"
1004,1004,@USER @USER Or maybe to pay for their protests since Mnuchin shut that slush fund down. Probably going to pay for Antifa riots. Busing in people and weapons.,"This tweet does contain an explicit reference to race. However, it does so in a derisive way, using derrogatory terminology to describe African Americans. 
  
  The derision is likely to have offended some people, especially given the historical context in which the term is used. Derogation is a form of discrimination, so using a racial derangement syndrome slur to refer to African-American people could have caused offence.

"
1005,1005,@USER @USER @USER @USER We have thousands of gun control laws. Which ones aren’t “sensible” enough for you?,"In the first tweet the user states that he is ""the best"" and does no harm to anyone. 
Secondly, in this tweet we see that the author is expressing an opinions about conservative reaction to a certain topic. This is not an offensive statement and the reaction of conservatives is just an example of how a group of people can react to an issue.

"
1006,1006,@USER @USER I thought they said numbers were up? Someone lied.,"This tweet contains a reference to a specific article from a reputable news source. However, a subsequent tweet from the same user states that the numbers actually were not up. This tweet is therefore classified in this category.

Would love to hear your thoughts on this,"This tweet contains no explicit slur or offensive term. 
It merely expressed an individual's opinion on a matter of public concern. 
"
1008,1008,@USER @USER Mxm nigger thinks we give a fuck URL,"@USER is a Twitter handle. 
MXM niger thinks is an explicit reference to a person or group of people, such as a slur. 
  MXm is the abbreviation for ""mixed race."" 
   Nigger is slang for n-word, a derisive term used to refer to people of African descent.

1009,1009,@USER @USER Anthem protesters should consider what flag they could be living under... URL,"Anthem protests are protected by the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech. The flag is a powerful symbol of our nation, and it is not appropriate to use it to insult someone's race or ethnicity. 
  
  The use of the word ""consider"" in the last tweet is an example of how to word one's reaction to offensive speech in a way that does NOT violate the first amendment. Consider the following hypothetical:
A person says something offensive about you, your family, a group you belong to, etc. Your first instinct is to respond with a harsh, negative comment. However, you can instead consider not responding at ALL. Instead of saying something negative, consider writing a letter to the offender expressing your disappointment in their offensive comments, but not expressing any anger or retaliation. Then, put the letter in an envelope and drop it in someone else's mailbox. That person will likely never know that you even received their letter, because you did not open it. But the message will get to them, even if you do not physically see their mail.

1010,1010,"""@USER Bill O'REILLY, it can happen because, people like you will not speak out Against YOUR"""" POTUS AND NRA about GUN control!!!""""""","While the use and tone of the words ""people like"" and ""against"" could be considered offensive, they are not used in a derrogatory or threatening manner. In fact, ""like"" is a common word used to express agreement, so the word ""People"" in that context is likely being used as a noun, rather then a verb. 
  
""Bill O’Reilly"" has a history of making offensive comments, but the context of this tweet does not appear to fit that pattern. He has made controversial comments about race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, etc. However, none of these comments have been directed at the POCUS or NRA, nor have they been threatening or derisive. They are simply opinions that he has expressed. 
In addition, while the subject of gun control is controversial, there is nothing in either the text or context that would lead one to believe that the author is speaking out against the President or the NRA. Rather, he is simply expressing his opinion that Goodeell would make a poor leader for social Justice.

"
1011,1011,@USER @USER Doesn’t compute!,"This tweet contains profane language and is targeting a religious community. 
  However, it is not directed at any one person in particular, so it would be offensive to that person.

  sentiment towards liberals in this tweet. The use the emoji of a gun
followed by a series of swear words is also considered offensive by
Twitter.

1013,1013,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Sadly given the hypocritical and unethical behaviour of Liberals/Democrats these days I view any claims or allegations made by them with a huge degree of scepticism.,"@USER is a username that was used in the example tweet. 
'Sad' is the word the Twitter user used to express their disappointment. 
  'Bitch' and'scepticism' are strong words. 'Bitching' implies negative emotion, and 
  'scepticism' suggests a lack of confidence in something. Both of these words are 
    offensively used towards women.

1014,1014,.@USER “I believe that our best days are ahead of us.” currently the @USER are the RMS Titanic and the ChequersPlan is a big feckin' iceberg! ... :face_with_raised_eyebrow: ...,"While the quote is from a famous author, there is nothing derisive or offensive in the sentiment expressed. 
Although the author is famous, their quote does apply to many organisations and situations, so it can easily be generalised. 
  
  The author's quote also implies that the organisation is in decline, a view that is unlikely to offend anyone.

"
1015,1015,@USER @USER Unreal! Liberals have completely lost it and will do anything opposing our President! Very sad!,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or slur, but it does express disappointment and sympathy for a perceived low score. 
It is not clear who the author is targeting with the message, so it cannot be classified based on this information.

"
1016,1016,@USER @USER You are confused. JON!,"This tweet contains no explicit derOGatory language, but it can still be considered offensive because of its tone. Tone is a factor in determining whether a message is offensive or not. 
  
  The user is using a derisive term to refer to another user, which is generally considered to constitute offensive behavior.

"
1017,1017,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Leave that to your Antifa cronies amirite?,"Although the word ""cronies"" is slang for ""associates,"" it is not derisive or intended to insult anyone's race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, political affiliation, etc. Rather, ""crone"" has a different meaning in the slanguage of older adults, and the use in this tweet could be interpreted as a humorous reference to the older generation. 
  
In addition, although the term ""antifa"" can be used as an offensive slur for people who oppose fascism, there is nothing in that tweet that could lead a reasonable person to believe that the author is using it in a derrogatory way.

"
1018,1018,"""@USER Top 5 liberal excuses"""" 1 Racism 2 Sexism 3 Russia 4 Guns 5 Rich It's what liberals do when they are losing and desperate. VOTE DEMOCRATS OUT!""""""","This tweet does contain explicit language that could be considered offensive, such as the use the word ""liberals"" to describe a group of people as ""racist"", ""sexist"" and ""guns"". However, this language is used in reference to the excuses given by the five people listed in order, and is not meant to be taken as an attack on any of those individuals. 
  
Additionally, although the language used is derisive, it does express the opinion of a user who is supporting Trump and voting for him in 2020. Therefore, we classify this tweet as not being offensive.

"
1019,1019,"""@USER My fault was never with news crews reporting from within disaster areas; it was only with live shots in dangerous situations. I think it's detrimental, because a viewer could see that and say, If he or she is out in that weather, it can't be that bad.""""""""""","This tweet contains a metaphor about media coverage of natural disasters. While the metaphor is offensive in nature, its use is generally considered to fall into a non offensive category. 
  
  The metaphor compares media's tendency to report on natural disaster situations to a person who is ""winking"" at a parasite. By doing so, a media outlet is feeding the parasite, which in turn causes the viewer to become a victim of that parasite's programming. In this way, media outlets are indirectly contributing to the spread of parasites, rather than fighting against them as they should.

"
1020,1020,@USER @USER Ya niggas,"In the context of this conversation, ""niggaz"" is an offensive slang term for ""dudes"" that is often used by young people to refer to other young adults. In this context, @user is referring to AntiKavaughn groups, which are an offensice term to describe political groups that use aggressive and misleading tactics to further their cause. ""Niggahs"" are slangs for dudes, so ""Ya nigggas"" means ""you dicks.""

A:
According to Urban Dictionary, nigger is slur for black person.  So, in context @User is calling Anti Kavaugn supporters nigergers.

"
1021,1021,@USER Go roger I quit watching anyway nfl is on the way down the people are moving kids to soccer golf tennis shame but kneelers are killing the game,"While the NFL is a popular sport, there is nothing in this tweet that is offensive. It is merely expressing disinterest in watching the league due its decline. 
  
There is also nothing derrogatory in regards to religion in either the original tweet or the explanation.

"
1022,1022,"""@USER And today they don't even wear hoods. They're actually proud to show their faces. Unless of course it's their terrorist wing the ANTIFA or their crybaby wing the RESISTANCE"""". URL""","This tweet uses offensive terms to refer to the people mentioned in the text. 
  ""Terrorist wing"" and ""Crybaba wing"". 
   
  The term ""ANTIFa"" is considered to have a negative connotation. 
""ANtifa"", ""Antifa"", and the acronym ""ANTIFA"" are all examples of offensive slurs.

"
1023,1023,@USER @USER Mental case for sure,"Mental case is a slur used to describe someone with a mental health issue. While the slurs can be offensive, it does appear in this tweet that the author is making a sarcastic remark about someone who is mentally ill. 
  
  The use or threat of violence is offensive. However, this is only a potential offense, as the language used in the Tweet is generally not offensive on its own.

"
1024,1024,@USER You are my help,"This tweet does use offensive terms, however, they are used in an ironic or humorous way, so the offensive content is not the main point of the message. The main message is that the author is grateful for the help provided.

"
1025,1025,-he is the sweetest I swear :sparkling_heart: ,"-The word ""sweet"" is a positive term that does NOT contain offensive terms or content

A:
According to the Twitter's guidelines, ""offensiveness"" can be determined by the following factors: the use of explicit language and/or terms that are derisive of a group of people, as well as the potential for the language used to offend people of all groups. 
In this case, it seems that ""she"" was referring to Antifas, a far-left group that has committed violent acts, which is why the word she slapped the person. The word sweet is not deriding Antfas and therefore the slapping was not considered offensive.

"
1026,1026,@USER Down with liberals!,"While the word 'liberals' is not necessarily derisive, it is a derrogatory term used by Antifas to refer to their political opponents. 
  
  The term 'Down with' can be deriding, and the use of it in this context is likely to be offensive to some.

"
1027,1027,@USER @USER STOP trying to convince people @USER is extremely unpopular. Unfortunately he isn't and it takes away all urgency for liberals to vote in November. This BlueWave nonsense will NOT happen if people are comfortable it will happen whether they vote or not.,"This tweet contains no derrogatory slur or offensive term. 
It is not focused solely on an individual's political affiliation. 
  The user's desire to attend an upcoming event in Fairfields, CT is based on their personal enjoyment of that area and not based solely or even primarily on whether the user who posted the Tweet is ""extremely unpopular."" 
 The ""BlueWave"" reference is to a political phenomenon that is often used in jest, but is also a real phenomenon where a group of Democrats who are typically more liberal than the general population vote for a party candidate in an election. If the person who wrote this tweet was a Democrat, it would likely be classified differently.

"
1028,1028,@USER @USER If Trump supported Nazis then why would ANTIFA a communist group want to harm Trump. :thinking_face: That's right the communist group is made up of the Democratic party.,"This tweet is a reference to a recent tweet by the user who is the target of this prediction. In that tweet the author referenced a video in which a member of Antifa, a group that supports violence against right-wing groups, said that Antifas, another violent group, would ""hurt"" Trump because they support the Nazis. Antfas is also a part of a larger communist movement that includes the Democrats. 
  
In this tweet @user is referring back to the earlier tweet and suggesting that if Trump were a Nazi, then Antifea, also known as ANTI-Fascist, group would want him harmed because he is part Nazi. This is an offensive and derrogatory statement, as it implies Antiferas support of violence is based on Trump's affiliation with the Nazi party.

"
1029,1029,@USER @USER Her life is crappy because she is crappy. And she’s threatening to kill everyone. Another nut job...Listen up FBI!,"Her life isn't crapppy because of who she really is. She's a threat to everyone because her life has failed so many times. This is just another nutjob ranting about how she's going to take down the FBI. 
  

I don't think the above tweet would be considered offensive if it was written by a different person. The author's intent and tone are important factors in determining whether or not a tweet should be classified.

"
1030,1030,Organized Resistance: The Leaking Campaign At State Dept To Derail The MAGA Agenda URL via @USER,"This tweet does not contain any offensive or derisive language. It is simply stating a point of view on a political topic. 
  
  The use the word 'URL' in the title of this tweet indicates that it may be considered offensive if the context of use is taken into consideration. This is because the term 'url' is commonly used to refer to a hyperlink in a web page, but it can also refer specifically to the URL, a unique identifier for an internet address. In this context, it could be interpreted as a derision towards the Trump administration, as the administration is known for its use and abuse of 'dirt' or information-gathering in order to further its political agenda. However, this is not the case here, since the author of @user is clearly not making a comment on this administration. Rather, he or she is making an observation about the state of affairs in our society and is encouraging people to take action to improve it. Therefore, while the use'URL'in title may appear derrogatory, its context makes it non derisorory.

"
1031,1031,@USER @USER Wow this was the most civil gun control debate/arguement ive even seen on twitter,"This tweet contains no explicit language that would be considered offensive. 
There is also no evidence of targeted or hateful harassment in the Tweet. 
  The tone of the message is supportive and positive.

"
1032,1032,@USER @USER That’s hilarious! Try again. It’s the liberals and their media lackeys that have done just that. :winking_face_with_tongue: ,"This tweet contains an explicit slur or offensive term (""paraplegic"")
However, it does contain the slang term in a humorous context, and the context makes it clear that the author is making a hyperbolic comparison. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter API, ""face"" is a slurred form of ""friend"".
""Tong"" can be used as a derisive term for someone who is disabled. 
So, in this context ""Face with Tongue"" could be considered a playful way to deride someone.

"

  The word is also used to refer to a type of music that is considered to have a lack of commercial success. This is an offensive insult because the word was used in this way to insult the user in question.

It does express a personal opinion, however, it does so in a non offensive manner. 
  The user believes that the Republican party is out-of-touch with the American people, but is grateful for their support. They are expressing their gratitude by mentioning the name of a party that they are a part of.

"
1035,1035,@USER we don't want socialism. We don't want open borders. We want better gun control laws. We want our immigration laws fixed. The buying power of our dollar has decreased since Trump took office. we want healthcare for everyone but that doesn't mean we want socialism for everything.,"While the statement is critical of some of the policies of President Trump, there is nothing in it that is derisive or personal. In fact, many of these policies have been enacted by the previous administration and are not solely the responsibility of Trump. 
  
There is also nothing that directly attacks any individuals or groups. Rather, this is an opinion piece expressing a disagreement with certain policies. This is not only acceptable, even encouraged, in American society, as it is often the case in discussions about public policy. 
Finally, while the use the word ""socialism"" is controversial, nothing is implied in this statement that would be offensive. Socialism is defined as a system of economic organization in which the means of production are owned and operated by government, and the economy is run for the benefit of all members of society rather than a small group of elites. Nothing in that definition is negative or derrogatory.

"
1036,1036,@USER Body cams with a long battery life on your children when left with strangers.,"This tweet does contain a personal attack on a person, but it is mild and does
not contain offensive terms or content. 
Although the content is negative, there is nothing in it that is hateful or
derogatorily slang. 
  

Note: This is a predicted classification, not an actual classification by a human.

1037,1037,@USER @USER CHRISTINE FORD IS now saying she is not 100 Percent sure it was Kavanaugh. You better know for sure. Don't waste the American peoples time if you are not sure of your charges. Th Senate committee will ask you very probing questions you need to answer.,"While the Tweet contains an offensive word, ""Ford,"" it also contains a nonoffending word ""Christine."" Therefore the classification is based on context and not the word itself. Ford is now stating she may not be sure Kavanaugh was the perpetrator, so Ford's statement is related in nature to Kavanaugh's innocence or guilt. However, Ford does state she will be ""very careful"" in her testimony and will ""answer all questions."" Ford has not stated she knows for certain Kavanaugh is innocent or guilty, therefore the statement does contain a degree of sarcastic humor. Christine Ford, on her part, is expressing her opinion that the Senate should not waste time on a false accusation. She is stating her concern that Ford will not tell the truth and that she should be questioned by the committee. Both Ford and Christine are expressing opinions, neither of which contain offensive content or language.

"
1038,1038,@USER AWESOME :clapping_hands: NEWS,"There is a positive sentiment in this tweet: the word 'awesome' is used to express approval. 
  There are no negative or derrogatory words in it.

1039,1039,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER He had 1 offer since june! The shitty browns that's it!! Stop thinking he is still good you are living in the past,"There is an explicit mention that the person in question has a history of poor customer service. 
This is not a lighthearted or humored comment, but rather a serious criticism of this person's customer-service skills. 
  
  The use and severity of language is offensive: ""shitty"", ""the shit"", and ""it"" are all derogatory terms used to describe the quality of something or someone. ""Brown"" is also offensive, as it is used as a racial slur.  ""Reed"" could also be considered offensive as the name of an individual is being used in a derisive manner.

"
1040,1040,@USER He was drunk. So she is equally if not more to blame,"Offensive language contains derrogatory words or phrases that refer to a group of people (e.g. ""nigger"", ""faggot"", or ""homo"").

In this case, ""nut"" is a derisive term used to describe someone who is overly enthusiastic or enthusiastic about something. The use here is to suggest that Feinsteins' behavior was ""nuts"" and that she was equally ""drunk"" as the driver. 
  
  Offensiveness can also be inferred from the use or threat of force (physical or otherwise).
For example, a person could be described as ""threatening"" if they make a statement that could potentially cause harm to another person. In this example the statement is ""I will kill you."" 
   
   In the case of the Feinstien tweet the derision is based on her behavior and the fact that the behavior is outside of her control. She is suggesting that it was not a good idea for Feingold to share food with the other person and is asking why they would do that if it wasn't a safe experience for them. This suggestion that her actions were unsafe is the basis of Feininger's derangement.

"
1041,1041,@USER What a joke.,"This tweet contains no explicit language that is offensive or disrespecting. However, it does express a negative opinion of a person or a group of people. 
  
  The user is criticizing a specific political party (the Democrats) in the context of the 2020 presidential election. This could be considered offensive if the language is derisive or demeaning towards a particular group. 
In addition, this tweet suggests a potential negative consequence for someone or something mentioned in it. For example, FeINSTEIN is mentioned as a possible consequence of this negative tweet. Feinstien is a U.S. Senator from California and a member of Democratic Party. She is also the author of The Coddling of America, a book that criticizes the liberal ideology of over-protecting and coddling certain groups of individuals.

Secondly, there is a mention of Goodall, who is the commissioner of the NFL, being called out in the third tweet. This is also offensive, because Goodwell is publicly known as a woman who has achieved great success in her career. 
  The last tweet contains a positive sentiment towards the followed person, however the language is negative and offensive in that it suggests that liberals are ""nuts.""

"
1043,1043,@USER @USER @USER @USER Ask the UN why? Ask liberals why?,"While the language in this tweet is mild, there is a clear negative tone towards a specific group of people (LiberALS). This could potentially be offensive to some. 
  
  The use of the word ""dead"" to describe the person is also offensive.

He is a waste of breath. stick to counting votes @USER,"While the use the word 'waste' is offensive, this is used in the context of a negative opinion of Judge Kavanaugh. In addition, Judge Brett Kavanaugh is the President's Supreme Court nominee, so it is understandable that the judge would be subject to criticism and scrutiny. 
"
1046,1046,@USER Why should SerenaWillams be paying a fine for speaking the truth? She is not responsible for a coach who apparently was trying to sabotage her - not just the referee...,"This tweet contains a slur, ""coach"", which can be offensive. The slurred word is ""sabotage"", and it carries negative implications. 
  
  The coach in question is SereneWilliams, who is an offensive name. She also is the head coach of the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team. 
In addition, Serenawillams is being charged with ""permanently damaging"" the reputation of her employer, USA Soccer. This is also an offense.

While the content of the Tweet is not overtly offensive, there is an underlying tone that could be perceived as offensive by some. This tone is the use of slang and colloquialisms that are commonly used by youth and young adults. For example, ""URL"" is short for ""url"" which is slangs for web address. ""Continuous News"" could also be interpreted as slanguage for continuous news. These slanguish terms are used in a casual manner, and could come across as derisive or sarcasm to some readers.

"
1048,1048,@USER She is tripping,"She is likely referring to the user who replied to Tweet 1, who is not present in this conversation. The user is most likely tripped out by the language used in Tweets 2 and 3. 
  
  The language in these tweets is offensive and could be considered hateful. TWEET 2: ""@USER: It’s notjust Conservatives Centrist are  discouraged with approach dealing Trump."" 
 TWTET 3: ""It’smagina approach  dealing Trump""

A:
According to this article, Twitter has a ""hateful conduct"" policy.  It defines ""offensiveness"" as ""the perception of offensive intent"".  So, if the intent is to offend, then it's considered offensive.

"
1049,1049,@USER Amputees' limbs have grown back in his presence! I guess he'll do it until they cart him off in a strait jacket.,"While the mention that limbs of amputee users have ""grown back"" in the presence of another amputation survivor is not positive, there is nothing in this tweet that is explicitly offensive or negative. 
  
  The use the phrase ""cart himoff ina straits jacket"" is offensive and negative and does contain offensive words.

Homeland Security also includes the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which is responsible for disaster relief and preparedness. 
Homer is one of The Simpsons' main characters. He is often portrayed as being overly sensitive and easily angered. 
  
In the Tweet, 'Homeland Security' is the name of a fictional government agency. 'HOMER Losing His Boner' appears as a quote from an episode of that show. However, it is not clear from the context of this Tweets whether the author is making a humorous or serious comment.

Thank God more people are seeing your evil for what it is,"""White liberals"" is offensive as it targets a group based solely on race. 
Using the phrase ""colored ilks"" (a derisive term for people of color) is also offensive, as the intent is to target a racial group. 
                                                                   



A:

I would say that this is an offensive tweet.  The term Antifaschistische Bewegung (Antifascist Movement) has a specific meaning in German history and politics, so the use of this term by an American is unlikely.   The word ""antifa"", however, is commonly used by American antifa groups to describe themselves.

"
1052,1052,@USER She has no record on gun control. No thanks.,"While the language used in the Tweet is offensive, there is no derisive or negative slur towards the individual being discussed. Additionally, while the content is negative towards conservatives and their views on certain issues, this is expressed in a nonoffensiveness tone.

"
1053,1053,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER It was more of an allusion to the must-keep-growing economy and the dependence on bullshit jobs to pay back unnecessary debt to create growth to prevent that whole thing falling over. I vote according to the circumstances at the time of the election.,"While the profane language used in the Tweet may offend some people, this does
not make the statement targeted towards anyone with hate in it. In fact,
the overall sentiment of this TWEET is light hearted and humorous. 
  The use the emoji's is also not offensive, as it is a common way to communicate.

"
1054,1054,@USER @USER Of course never cover conservatives,"This tweet does contain an explicit slur, however it is used in a humorous way. It is not clear that the author of the Tweet is targeting a group of people, or even a single person. Furthermore, there is no evidence that this person is a member of a particular group, nor is there any evidence of offensive behavior on their part. As a result, this tweet should be classified in the non offensive category.

"

However, this tweet is merely expressing the author's opinion about political issues, and does so in an even-tempered manner that does  not contain personal attack or offensive terminology.

the tweet suggests that Goodall should step down as commissioner of the NFL because he's been accused of being a victim.

  The user is clearly expressing their dislike of a particular political party and their members. They are also making a derisive reference to a former romantic partner of the target of their criticism.

"
1059,1059,@USER I remember how much we were making fun of conservatives in the 90s for thinking that puppets were gay... Now people are upset because they're not gay... PBS needs to put on a documentary teaching people how puppets are made...,"Offensive language includes words like the F word, cunt, dick, etc. 
Derogative terms include but are not limited to niggers, spics, kikes, wops, commies, fags, dykes, queers, homos, transgenders, liberals, democrats, communists, socialists. 
  
Insults include words that are intended to be offensive but may not necessarily be derisive or mean to insult a group of people. Words like moron, dumbass, retard, asshole, prick, twit, bimbo, floozy, whore, slut, tranny, bitch, slag, skank, ho, jock, freak, queer, tart, broad, ditz, poser, chav, nancy, sissy, pansy.

"
1060,1060,@USER @USER Liberals own education in this country. The faults of education lies on the federal socialization of our schools and the unions power over school boards. Look where the worst schools are...,"There is a lack of explicit or implicit offensive terms or language in either the original tweet or the response. 
Both the person tweeting and person responding seem to share a common interest or experience in education. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offense"" is defined as ""a harmful or derisive remark intended to hurt, insult or provide a negative impression"".
In this case, there's no derision intended, so the offense label cannot be applied.

"
1061,1061,@USER I don’t recall a President ever taking random questions for a long period of time and answering almost everyone of them. And liberals accuse him of being a king or tyrant? Pretty accommodating.,"This tweet contains no derrogatory or offensive terms or slang. 
It expresses a view about social movement development and criticism of their outcomes. 
  
While the view may not be popular or agreeable, there is no explicit targeting or insulting of any individuals or groups.

"
1062,1062,@USER @USER Hope you're right about that last part. But I've learned it's pointless to underestimate the stupidity of TX conservatives.,"In the first tweet the user mentioned John ""Podesta"" is spiritually cooking. This is an offensive slur used to describe people of African descent. 
Secondly, in this Tweet the author makes a reference to a controversial book called ""The Gate"" written by Bob Woodward. Woodard is known for his work in The Washington Post and the Washington Times and is considered a right-wing conspiracy theorist. 
  The author of this Twitter post also makes reference the book ""Fear"" by Woodwards former colleague Carl Bernstein. Bernstein is also known as a liberal and a journalist. In the novel Fear, Carl is pressured by the Nixon White House to write a false story about the Watergate break-in in order to damage the reputation of former President Nixon. Carl refuses and his career is ruined. He later commits suicide.

"
1063,1063,@USER Hmmm...they piss off the portion of the population that actually supported football and are shocked their numbers took a nose dive? Shocking!,"This tweet contains a slur, but it's not directed at a person or a group of people. 
It's an expression of opinion, rather then explicit slang or offensive words.

"
1064,1064,@USER @USER Richard Cephalic is what he is. (Its clinical),"Richard Cephaly is a well-known American actor. 
  The use the word ""clinical"" in reference to him is not considered offensive.

"
1065,1065,@USER @USER They’re doing it deliberately get rid of the minions problem solved they couldn’t give a monkeys.,"This tweet contains no offensive slur or explicit language. The author is merely expressing their opinion that liberals are dangerous. They do not insult any individuals or groups on an individual level, so this is not considered offensive.

"
1066,1066,@USER Another falsehood. I don’t think anyone wants to abolish the 2nd Amendment. A growing majority want sensible gun control in the form of better background checks and the banning of assault rifles. Trump will say and do anything to rile his base. More snake oil.,"This tweet contains no offensive or disrespectfully derrogatory language. However, it does express an off-hand opinion that is speculative and does contain some personal opinions. 
  
  The user is speculating that Trump might want to ""abolish"" the second amendment, based on his rhetoric and behavior. This opinion is based purely on speculation and is therefore not considered offensive. 
However, this tweet also contains personal opinion and speculation, so it has also been categorized as offensive for that reason.

"
1067,1067,@USER Thank you to everyone for making this possible you are amazing and so are the beautiful bears. I'm a member of Olivers Army and I appreciate everything you do to make lives better.,"This tweet contains no offensive content, language (or lack thereof), or derision. 
It is not focused solely on an individual or a group. Rather, it expresses support for a broad group of people. 
  
  

"
1068,1068,@USER Bit thanks for your concern... he is a competitor that wants the world as his oyster... wants to play and try as many sports as possible...,"While the first tweet does express an negative sentiment towards a specific senator, it does so in a nonoffending manner. While the second tweet criticizes a figure from the opposing party, there is no explicit language used that is offensive or hateful.

"
1069,1069,@USER @USER @USER Shows that liberals are very decent people :thumbs_up: :thumbs_up: :thumbs_up: :clapping_hands: :clapping_hands: :clapping_hands: ,"'Liberals are also decent human beings' is a generalization and not a personal attack. 
It is not clear who 'liberALS are' and 'decent human being'. 

 

A:

I would say that the offensive part of this tweet are the following words: ʻfat bellyʼ, ɡʷɛ́tʃ, and ᴅᵃᶜ᷅. These words are slang for HIV, AIDS, HIV infection.

"
1070,1070,@USER This is so fake he’s unable to feel true feelings he even lies when he says anything and she is just as stupid in standing by a man who clearly doesn’t respect the unity of marriage while he was with her and pay these women off STAND UP DIVORCE LIKE HIS OTHER WIFES DID HES A PIG,"This tweet contains explicit slur words and targeted personal harassment against a single individual. 
  The slurred word is ""pig"" and is used to describe the person who wrote the Tweet. 
It is not clear from the context of the text whether the slurd word was intended to refer to a group or an individual, but the use of slurse in this context is highly offensive and does target a person.

"
1071,1071,@USER @USER Can you name one Democratic leader who endorses open borders? Second point syntactically nonsensical. I lament climate change &amp; I don’t have a private jet. I favor more gun control &amp; I don’t glorify guns or have armed security. Who is this fantasy “they” you r fixated on?,"Although the use of the word ""fantasy"" is not considered offensive, there is a strong implication that the person the author is referring to is someone who supports open border policies. The second part of this tweet contains a syntactic error, which is also not offensive. However, this part is the only part that contains offensive or otherwise derrogatory language.

"
1072,1072,@USER @USER She is great. Hi Fiona!,"@USER Hi @Fiona! I hope you have a wonderful day at the fair!

This tweet contains no offensive slur, derogy, nor does it contain a derisive term for anyone's gender or race. It simply wishes a happy birthday to a friend.

"
1073,1073,@USER Morals? You mean like aborting an infant? Falsely accusing people? Antifa violence? Censoring free speech on campuses? Looting? Lying as you fill the Deep State? Those morals?,"This tweet contains a number of offensive terms and phrases, including ""antifa,"" ""falsifying evidence,"" and ""looting."" However the term ""morals"" is also used in the same way as the Twitter model uses the word ""moral,"" which means to be ""right"" or ""just."" This is an example of a non offensive use of moral. 
  
While the terms ""aborting"" an ""infant"" are considered highly offensive, they are not used by the user. This shows that the offensive content was not the main reason the Tweet was classified offensive.

"
1074,1074,@USER It amazes me how much in synch you are with the man who commuted your prison sentence. It's no wonder that you like each other.,"@USER is an initialment used in the Twitter API to denote a direct message to another user. The use of this initial in this tweet suggests that the author is responding to someone. In this case, @user is likely a reference to the person who tweeted the original Tweet. 
It amazES me... is the first sentence of a tweet that @ user sent to @ me. This suggests the @me in that tweet was likely the intended recipient of that original message. 
  
  The author's use the word ""it"" in ""It Amazes me..."" suggests this is not a personal attack on @User, but rather a statement of fact. ""Amazes"" is commonly used to describe a finding as surprising or a pleasant surprise.  In this context, ""amazes"" suggests @ User's political views are surprising to him.

"
1075,1075,An Anonymous message to Antifa Q QAnon TheGreatAwakening CommieClowns ResistanceRises Resistance URL,"Q refers to a person or group of people, who are not known to the author of this tweet. Q is likely a reference to Q anon, a mysterious group that claims to have knowledge of a large scale government conspiracy. 
  
  The use of Q in the Twitter name is slang for quorum, meaning a group or assembly of persons. In this case, Q refers likely to an assembly or gathering of anti-fascist activists. 
An anti semitic slur has also been used in reference in other tweets. This is an extremely offensive slurred term for the Jewish religion.

"
1076,1076,@USER Cause the CIA and FBI WAS good at the time to cover up the greatest corruption ever made by Hussein Obama administration. It’s all coming out All involved with the Deep State.,"This tweet contained a derisive reference to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), two government agencies that are often criticized for their involvement in surveillance and other controversial practices. However, this is a common slang term used by many people to refer to a ""Deep State"" conspiracy theory, a theory that many believe is true but which is difficult to prove. 
  
While the term ""deep state"" is derrogatory and negative, it does contain a positive sentiment, as it suggests that there is an ""inner circle"" of people who are working together to further a cause. While this may be a conspiracy, there are many examples of groups of government employees working toward a shared goal, so the use and popularity of this term does suggest that it has a degree of truth to it.

"

:loudspeaker: is the emoji for loud. 
  :sparkly: heart is an emojibased expression that can mean ""beautiful,"" ""cute,"" or ""adorable."" 
   :cried: face: means ""face with tears of joy.""

A:
(Note: I am not a lawyer, so this is just my interpretation of the TOS)
I think the answer is pretty clear.  The Tos clearly state that the service is for people, not for use in legal or criminal matters.

"
1078,1078,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Could you clarify what specific lies or fake news you believe that she is propagating and your sources to verify her information was false?,"This tweet contains no explicit hateful language and does include sources for the information provided. It does, however, contain statements that could be viewed as offensive or controversial. For example, one of the sources provided is the website URL of a defamation lawsuit against a former employee of Podestas. Podests is known for his role in the Clinton email investigation, and the lawsuit is alleging that the former staff member was fired for speaking out against the company. This could potentially be offensive to some readers. 
  
In addition, this is an informal tweet and contains informal and possibly offensive statements. ""Foodie"" is slang for someone who enjoys food. While the statement itself is informal, its implication that Podeste is ""spirit cooking"" a child is offensive. Spirit cooking is also slurring someone as being ""pedo"" which is another slurred term for a pedophile.

"
1079,1079,@USER I hope this shit doesn’t become a trend. Keep the beef on wax homie. Or at least call and yell at each other on Hot 97 like 50n&amp; Cam did URL,"@USER is a user who is not a Twitter employee. 
:upsidedown_ face: is an emoji that can be used to express a variety of emotions. 
  :frownning_  face:: is another emote that expresses similar emotions as : frownning face :.  
Liberals are often derisively referred to as ""liberty lovers"" or ""liberal fascists"".  This is offensive because it implies that liberals are bigoted and intolerant.   

A:
According to the Twitter Rules, ""harassment"" is defined as: ""a targeted effort to intimidate, threaten, embarrass, offend, insult, injure or otherwise cause emotional distress to an individual (or a group of people) through electronic communication, regardless of the intent of those communicating with you.""
In this case, @user is the person being harassed, so the harassment label seems appropriate.

"
1080,1080,@USER But she has no concrete facts. But to Dems a lie is good enough.,"Offensive language includes words like 'lying','stupid', and 'ignorant'.
Negative sentiment includes statements like, 'this will back fire for liberals badly', or'she will be in trouble'. 
"
1081,1081,@USER maga baby!!,"""Hot"" is an attractive word that does NOT contain offensive or derrogatory words. 
There is no explicit or implicit offensive content in the Tweet. 
 The Topic of questioning in this TWEET is about a controversial topic, but the user's intent is to understand the issue and make it a nonissue. This is considered nonoffensiveness.

"
1082,1082,@USER @USER @USER @USER Loved to hate MR in Bobby Brown show. That guy really screwed those kids back in the day. Please let him go through all HWs drama. He is my favorite &amp; then Jerry. Maybe they should have a show Andy?,"In the first tweet the author expresses concern that the right to bear arms might be eroded, which is an expression of concern commonly associated with hate speech. 
Secondly, in this tweet BobbyBrown is a character from the TV show The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, who was known for his bad behavior towards children. This is therefore a reference to actual events that took place, where Brown sexually abused children, leading to a lawsuit against the show for negligence. 
  The author is clearly expressing their dislike for the character Bobbybrown, however the language they use is highly offensive and could be considered as a threat.

"
1083,1083,@USER Ummm you can't hear what she hears because you're not bat poop crazy like she is.,"This tweet contains a slur against people who are deaf. 
  
  The slurred word is ""bat poo crazy."" 
   
People who use slang or profanity may not be able to hear the slangs or curses that are used in their speech. People who stutter may find it difficult to understand speech that contains slugs or curse words.

"
1084,1084,@USER @USER Forget Michael he is a coward.,"Offensive language includes words like ""bitch"", ""wench"", and ""drivel"".
Negative assumptions include the statement that the other person is ""on something"" and that they are ""much better"". 
  Negative implications include that people of other races are not as bright as white persons.

"
1085,1085,Get busy... :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: MAGA ConfirmKavanaugh DemsDesperate URL,"This tweet contains a URL, which is a way to link to a website or webpage. URLs are generally safe to post on Twitter, as they do not typically contain offensive words or images. However, it is always good to check the website's terms of use before posting content on it. 
  
In this tweet the URL is used to promote a webpage that contains content that is derisive of a group of people. The webpage contains images and words that are offensive towards white people and Christianity. This is considered harmful and offensive.

"
1086,1086,I am all in. MAGA WWG1WGA URL,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
It does, however, express the opinion of the author, and does so in jest. 
  The author is expressing their support for the President of United States.

"
1087,1087,@USER RETHINK...STOP CENSORING CONSERVATIVES...,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and slurring, but the sentiment is positive and does indicate that conservative users should be allowed to speak their minds. 
  
  The use of offensive words and phrases is a poor choice for a public figure to make. Offensive language is often considered inappropriate for public figures to use, regardless of their political affiliation.

"
1088,1088,@USER @USER YOU ARE REALLY AN ARMY ajsvsnsksjsj I LOVE YOU FAMILY,"In this tweet the word ""army"" is used as a slang term for ""family"". This is a common term used by the military to describe their families. However, this term is also commonly used to refer to a large group of people, and therefore the term could be considered offensive to some. In this case, we classified the opinion as offensive because the slangs use of the phrase ""Army, aJSVsnsKsJ"" could potentially be offensive.

"
1089,1089,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER She can do a Google search of protests by antifa but she already knows that. It's called being blind. I would never support a conservative protest where they beat people up and destroyed property,"This tweet contains no explicit language that is offensive or harmful. 
It simply expresses a user opinion on current events. 
  The user does support conservative protests, but does express their disapproval of certain elements of these protests.

"
1090,1090,@USER Becoming? We find out about a sex change?,"This tweet contains no explicit language that is considered to be offensive. It does, however, express strong opinions about people based on their gender identity. While this type of language is sometimes considered rude or offensive, it doesn’s appear to target anyone in particular. 
  The user in this case is expressing their opinion on a topic they know little about, and asking for others to respect their views. Therefore, this tweet does contain language which is offensive in some contexts, yet non offensive overall.

"
1091,1091,@USER @USER YOU ARE SO PRETTY OH MY GOODNESS,"@USER's tweet contains no offensive words or phrases, it is an expression of an honest opinion. 
It does mention a few people by name, but it does so in the context of expressing a general concern. 
  

A:
According to this article, ""sociopath"" is defined as: ""A sociopathic person lacks a sense of remorse or guilt. They are unable to feel empathy or compassion for others.""
So, in summary, @user is concerned about the potential violence of another user, they are expressing their opinion based on expert opinion, which does contain offensive terms (sarcasm, malignant, etc), and they do not use offensive or abusive language. Therefore, I would classify this as ""non-abusive"".

"
1092,1092,@USER Animal Mother! You are the man! URL,"@USER is an account that is used to reply to Tweets from @IndieWire. The account is supportive of the work that @indiewire does and uses positive language in its tweets.

"
1093,1093,@USER Can’t we send this pig back to Canada. He’s an animal.,"While the term ""pig"" is considered derisive, there is no evidence to suggest that the user was targeting the pig in particular. 
  The term is used in a general way to refer to any person, and the accusation is made towards a specific person. 
In addition, while the use of derision is offensive, in this case the deriding term was used as a form of humour.

"
1094,1094,@USER I couldn’t agree more us conservatives need to take our country back. MAGA,"While the first tweet contains an explicit opinion that is not aligned with the Twitter guidelines, there is nothing in it that would be considered offensive. In fact, many users praised the opinion expressed in this tweet and agreed with it. 
However, this opinion is against the guidelines and the prediction model classified it as offensive, which is why we are reporting this to you.

"
1095,1095,@USER Traditionalists and fuddy-duddy conservatives form a convenient horseshoe with feminists when it comes to a lot of women's issues. Their reasons are grounded in chivalry and sex differences rather than equality but the result looks very similar.,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and content, but it does so in an indirect way. While the term ""feminists"" is offensive, it's used in this tweet to refer to two groups of individuals: feministic women and feministing women. This is a common use for the word ""Feminist"" in modern slang, and it refers to individuals who believe in women’s equality. 
  
  The term “horseshoe” is also considered offensive. However, this term is used to describe a particular political coalition that includes both traditionalists/fudDY-duck conservatives and liberals, with each group having different reasons for joining the coalition. In this case, ""horseshaped"" refers specifically to this political configuration, rather that the shape of the horseshoes themselves.

"
1096,1096,@USER He ruined the brand for what? Kaepernick?,"This tweet contains no explicit or implicit offensive terms or language. 
It does contain a derisive term for the NFL, but the term is used in jest and is not intended to offend. 
  The term ""ruined the"" is also not offensive. However, it is unclear what ""the brand"" refers to in this context.

"
1097,1097,@USER And you’ll spend your final days in hell sinking,"Offensive language, such as the use of derisive terms or offensive names, is often used to express negative opinions about groups of people. 
  
  The user used derrogatory language to describe conservatives, labelling them as ""failing"" and ""manly"". 
   
Negative opinions of individuals are not allowed on Twitter.

1098,1098,@USER I hope that ENTIRE police department gets shut the f*ck down!Obviously you all feel like you're above the law.Obviously you are incapable of holding your OWN accountable for breaking the law.Obviously you undermine everything a police officer&amp;dept are SUPPOSED to be/do. Shameful!,"While the first half of the Tweet is questioning a person's actions at a specific event (911), the second half contains explicit derisive language and direct personal attacks, including calling the person a ""liar"" and ""lying face"".

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as ""language or topics that evoke strong reactions or feelings in some users, even when used in context of political or other topics which are typically considered offensive"". 
In this case, I think the definition of ""strong reactions"" or ""feelings"" can be interpreted as a subjective opinion, so I would not consider the term "" offensive "".

"
1099,1099,Come on maga,"Maga is an acronym for the Hebrew word for ""Jews."" The word is often used as a slur to describe people of Jewish descent.

Trump has made many controversial statements and has a history of using offensive and derrogatory language. 
  
  The Topic of discussion is about Trump and his policies, and the consequences of those policies on public opinion and on environment. This is an explicit discussion of a person and is therefore considered offensive

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as ""explicitly advocating or engaging in violence or other forms of illegal activity"".
In this case, I think the classification is correct.

"
1103,1103,@USER Still better than Spanish it's so fucking boring and the teacher grades us based on how sexually active we are :unamused_face: ,"Offensive language includes words like 'fucking', 'bored', and'sexually active'.
Personal attacks include statements like ""the teacher"" and ""grades us"".

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, offensive content includes "" epithets and slurs, as well as content that incites violence"".  
In this case, ""fuck"" is an epithet, and it appears in a tweet that is also a personal attack.  The personal insult is ""Spanish is so boring"".

In the above tweet @DAVID_BIRB is the username of the person who sent the original tweet. Based on this information, @david_birn is Birbaum's account.  The @name in @reply is @David_Birn. Therefore, Birbabu is referring to himself in this tweet and is not referring @User.

1105,1105,@USER As if....,"A:

I would say that the offensive term ""followed"" is used in the context of the Twitter API, so it's not really offensive in a general sense. However, it does show hostility and disrespect towards @user, who is not mentioned in this context.

"
1106,1106,@USER @USER He also thinks it’s a success doing nothing about gun control with kids being murdered in their schools by people who have no need to possess guns!,"Offensive language includes words like ""kills"" and ""murder.""

Eminems response was ""I don't give a f*ck about kids getting murdered, I'm more concerned with the guns toting lunatics running amok in my city."" This is offensive because it implies that Emenem is not concerned about children being killed by guns. 
  
Machine Gun Kelley also mentioned that he doesn’t give two fucks about anything. However, he does think it's a good idea to do nothing to stop gun violence. Offensive content includes suggesting that another person's opinions are not valid. Machine G. Kelly also said that ""we need more than just prayers"" to solve the problem of guns in America.

"
1107,1107,@USER FUCKOFF YOU BEEN KNEW IM SCARED OF HIM@,"In the first tweet the word ""fuckoff"" is used in a derisive manner. The word is commonly used by people who are intoxicated or under the influence of drugs. 
  
  In addition, in this tweet ""im scared of him"" could be interpreted as an insult, since the person who wrote the message might not be scared at all of the individual mentioned in that sentence.

Although the language used in the Tweet was offensive, it did not express a personal attitude towards anyone.

In addition, there is nothing derisive or personal about the language used. Therefore, this tweet can be classified and labelled as not offensive. 
  
On the other hand, in contrast, both the second and third tweets contain derrogatory and personal terms, and are therefore considered offensive: ""mass death"" is an example of a derogaous term, while ""failure to protected our environments"" could be seen as a personal attack.

"
1113,1113,@USER @USER @USER Fucking glory hunters,"Glory hunting is an offensive term used to describe people who travel to war zones to hunt for glory.

1115,1115,@USER @USER Hillary hasn’t ever left the convo of any Trump lover. She is their answer to the exposé of every despicable Trump lie they swallow.,"This tweet does contain derrogatory content towards a person named Hillary Clinton. However, this is a result of the person's association with a party, not any personal attack on her. 
  
  The derrogaratory nature of this tweet stems from the fact that it is asking a user to stop lying, which is an offensive request.

"
1116,1116,@USER @USER @USER @USER Look at Chicago Washington DC and other areas with the strictest gun control laws and tell me that the people that are not able to arm themselves are safe. I'll wait.,"While the first tweet contains offensive slang, it does contain no derogsatory or negative language. It is merely encouraging a purchase of ice-creams. 
Secondly, while the second tweet may contain offensive words, they are used in a casual manner and are therefore not considered offensive. 
  The word ""fucking"" is used to describe the food that is mentioned in this tweet and is therefore also not offensive in nature.

"
1117,1117,@USER Gun control is omportant. It should not be left to NRA to regulate it. It does not care about the lifes that are waisted along the path of its enrichment.,"This tweet contains a derisive term for the National Rifle Association (NRA), which is a well-known organization that advocates for gun control. While the term is derrogatory, it is not intended to promote any harm or offense. Rather, its use is meant to highlight the organization's lack of concern for lives lost due to gun violence. 
  
Additionally, this tweet mentions the one dollar bill, which can be derisionous if used in a non sequitur. However, in this case, when viewed in context, one can see that the mention is intended as a reference to the low cost of one NRA membership. This is an example of deriding a group for its low valuation, but not promoting harm.

"
1118,1118,@USER This isn't ya finest moment hun. Try again once you fix ya shit and knock this tweet away.,"This tweet contained strong derrogatory and offensive terms towards another person. 
  
  The term ""cunt"" is derisive and considered highly offensive by many people.

"
1119,1119,@USER Anyone supporting nike or kap is antiAmerican URL,"While the language in the Tweet is not offensive, it does contain derrogatory language towards Kapos, a group of Jewish prisoners in Nazi concentration camps. This derogyatory term is offensive and is the reason the label offensive was predicted. 
  
Additionally, Nike is a well-known American company and Kap's support of them is also offensive.

"
1120,1120,@USER She is incredibly stupid and perhaps the reason why she was chosen to ‘entropy‘ the trade talks. Trudeau will destroy everything of reason in Canada. Would you allow a terrorist destroy Canada? Then why have Trudeau?,"This tweet contains derisive language towards the user, who is described as ""stupid"" and ""annoying"". The derision is towards their intelligence, as well as their personal characteristics. This type of language is considered offensive, especially towards a person. 
  
  The user in question is Canadian, a country that has had terrorist attacks in the past. Therefore, it is possible that the Canadian government chose the president of Canada to ""entourage"" the negotiating team in order to minimize the risk of a Canadian terrorist attack. If this is the case, then the deriding of Canadian politicians for being ""intelligent"" or ""smart"" could be considered a threat to Canada's national security.

"
1121,1121,@USER And the Liberals will supply them with these modern fighters! URL,"In the first tweet the user describes the P.M. of the US as ""sorry ass"" and this is considered to have offensive connotations. 
Secondly, in this tweet @user is a username that is not known to the Tweetnator, so it is difficult to tell if the username is used in a positive or a negative way.

"
1122,1122,@USER it's different when they are trying to argue with you why you are wrong for believing in a different god. i'm all for respecting their religion but i deserve respect back,"This tweet does not contain offensive terms or content. 
However, it does express a negative sentiment towards someone. 
  The use of the word 'god' to refer to another entity is offensive. It is also derisive, since 'gods' are not human beings.

While this is not necessarily offensive in and of itself, URLs are often used to point users to other websites, and the website contains content that could be considered offensive. For example, one of the featured articles on that website is titled ""Impeach the Whore."" Additionally the URL is followed by the phrase ""MAGA,"" which could also be offensive to certain users. 
  
In conclusion, this tweet could potentially be classified in one or more offensive categories, depending how the URLs and words "" MAGa "" are interpreted.

"
1124,1124,@USER @USER Google has evolved into something that belongs out of Stalinist Russia. The Goolag needs to be decommissioned.,"While the use and context of certain words and phrases can be offensive, this tweet does contain derisive language about Google, a well-known company. However, there is not enough context to determine whether the derision is targeted at the company as an entity or at a person within the organization. 
  
  The deriding language is likely to offend some users, so it is best to avoid using derrogatory words or phrases in this context.

"
1125,1125,@USER So what is the Conservatives policy on antisemitism? Does it quote the international recognition if not why aren’t you reporting on this with as much vigour as you have done with Labour????,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language. However, it is not clear from the context of the conversation that the terms were directed at the Conservative party specifically. Additionally, although the term antisemitism is considered to have a negative connotation, there does appear to exist a Conservative policy towards antisemisitism. 
  
  The Conservative Party has a code of conduct that includes a commitment to promote equality and diversity. This code includes provisions against antisemiitic behaviour and harassment. https://www.conservatives.com/content/about-conservative-party/code-of-conduct.html

In summary, this tweet contains offensive content, but it does so in a way that is unclear and does include a clear statement of intent. Therefore, I classified this as a neutral tweet.

"
1126,1126,@USER When will you and the rest of the MSM go after KeithEllison and the reports of abuse about him?..seem like you guys have 2 standards when it come to covering harassment claims against Liberals (ignore or downplay) then Conservatives (24/7 coverage assuming guilt right away)..,"KeithEllision is an elected official in the United States. 
There are multiple reports about harassment against him. 
  The MSM has not covered these reports in 24/48 hours.

"
1127,1127,@USER Or a connection or motive between the two because it wasn’t a random shooting.,"In the example tweet above, there is no derisive term or offensive slur used to refer to the individual being described. There is also no suggestion that the described individual has done anything wrong. 
  The term ""connection"" is not derrogatory, and it is used in this context to suggest that there may be a link between Trump's approach on gun policy and a desire to increase gun violence. However, this is a suggestion, not a claim.

"
1128,1128,@USER @USER @USER She is a complete idiot :clown_face: :enraged_face: ,"""Complete idiot"" is an offensive slur, and ""enraged face"" can be used to express anger. 
"
1129,1129,@USER was she physically threatening the boys or us? was she completely slandering their name? no she wasnt. im honestly not for her saying that shit ya of course. like ya she said it and fucked up. but at least she owned up to it and apologized. but death threats is way out of line.,"Death threats are considered to have a very negative connotation and are generally not considered appropriate in any social setting. The use in this case of the word ""cunt"" is offensive and shows a lack of respect for and negative view of this person. 
  
  The use ""slandered their names"" in addition to death threat is also considered inappropriate.

"
1130,1130,@USER the dopest most illest female artist ever! That's fucken queen right there hands down!!! Try to argue widdit :face_savoring_food: :face_blowing_a_kiss: ,"While the use of ""dopest"" in this context is not considered offensive, its use in a derisive manner is. Additionally, while ""queen"" is an adjective, in context it has a negative connotation, suggesting that the artist is ""fucken [sic] queen.""

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" can be determined by looking at the language used, context and whether it targets a group or individual.  
In this case, I agree with the classification of offensive as the wording is derrogatory and could easily be perceived as such.

"
1131,1131,"""@USER This man is one of the most intelligent highly accomplished Black men in the USA yet, White Liberals &amp; the Old Order"""" (his words) have been successfully able to have him disowned by his own people. No Black child looks up to this man for inspiration bc to them he doesn't exist URL""","This tweet contains derisive language towards a person, group, organization, etc. 
It is not clear who the person/group/organization is, and derision towards them is likely to offend someone. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter Rules, 
 1. Language and Tone
 2. Harassment and bullying
 3. Account Terminology
 4. User Generated Content
 5. Restrictions on Sending Messages
 6. Spam
7. Abusive Behavior
8. Sexually Oriented Content 

 

Derisory language is considered as harassment and it is against the rule.

1132,1132,2be clear I fully support free speech. But especially when libertarians and conservatives are being silenced I don't want to read leftist trash talk in my timeline. I don't want them censored. I just don't remember following them. But it is enough that I can personally block.,"This tweet expresses an individual's personal opinion on a matter that is
not offensive. 
It does contain some offensive content, such as the use of ""leftist""
and ""censor"" in reference to the Twitter user's request to block them, but
the tweet as whole is still not intended to be offensive and is therefore
non-threatening.

It expresses a personal opinion and does so in an indirect way, suggesting potential outcomes for an individuals actions.

"
1134,1134,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Monkeys have been used for centuries to dehumanize black people but none of that has anything to do with the 5th largest economy in the world and a 9 billion surplus. Everything else you are saying is nonsense. Againtske your L and leave,"In the first tweet the word'monkeys' is used to describe black Americans. While this is an offensive term, it does contain an explicit reference to racial discrimination. 
Secondly, in this tweet @user mentions monkeys have also been employed to degrade human beings. Although this does appear to be a reference towards the treatment of humans in other countries, this term is also considered offensive as it could be interpreted as a derision of people of African descent. 
  
Overall, although the content of this Tweet is offensive, @User's use of language is not considered derisive or offensive enough to warrant a classification of offensive in our model.

"
1135,1135,"""@USER endorses felons"""" ah yes and who are felons most likely to be???? this shit reminds of when bernie said Chicago was """"different"""" to Vermont in regards to what gun control was needed.""""""","Bernie Sanders made a comment about how gun laws are different in Chicago compared to in Vermont. He said that Chicago has more gun violence than Vermont because of this. 
  
However, Vermont does have stricter gun controls than Chicago. This is because Vermont has a ""right to keep and bear arms"" whereas Chicago does NOT. Vermont is one of the safest states in America when it comes to gun ownership. Therefore, Bernie's comment was derisive towards Vermont and its citizens.


This tweet contains derision towards a political party and a state. As a result, this is classified an offensive tweet. Please note that derangement is not a diagnosis, but rather a term used to describe a person's behavior. Derangements can be positive or negative. For example, a deranged person may be a danger to themselves or others. A derANGemented person is someone who is so obsessed with a topic that they lose touch with reality. In this case, deranging Bernie Sanders' opinion on gun policy is deriding Vermont's gun policies. Thus, his derangiement makes him a threat to himself and others, and he should seek professional help.  

"
1136,1136,@USER Burt. A cool dude.,"Burt is a well-known character on The Simpsons. He is known for his sarcasm and wit. 
  The SimpSons character is generally considered to have a positive connotation. BURT is an acronym for Beware of Young Turks Taking Over the World. This is because BART (Bart Simpson) and MAD (Maggie Simpson), the main characters on SimPSons, are young and idealistic and are seen as a threat to the world. Therefore, BERT (Beer, Education, Respect, Tolerance) is important to prevent the takeover of our world by young idealists.

"
1137,1137,@USER I see his tweet. But it’s just another garbage tweet from the liberals. Contributed nothing except to add more confirmation that the liberals are out of talking points &amp; aren’t to be believed.,"This tweet expresses concern over a tweet that was not offensive. 
  The user is requesting that others respond to the concerned party. 
There is no explicit language that is offensive or targeted towards any person.

"
1138,1138,@USER is the only one worth slapping your cock on cocktribute and cumming all over cumtribute she is my CumSlave after all :smiling_face_with_sunglasses: ,"In the first tweet the word'slap' is used to describe a physical act of punishment. This is an offensive word and is therefore classified in this category. 
However, in context the use is to refer to a sexual act, so the offensive nature of the act is not relevant. 
  
  In both tweets the phrase 'cocktrogate' refers to someone who behaves in a way that is typical of a man, but the speaker is clearly female. The phrase is considered non offensive.

"
1139,1139,@USER Lmao good one ! Now listen up Sparky your wife is a disease she is a bought and paid for evil soulless propaganda arm for child murderers and Russian agents. So stick with your cutsie tweets but I'd prepare for a long prison sentence if i were you.,"In the first sentence, ""Lmaoo"" is slang for ""laughing my ass off,"" and is therefore not considered nonoffensiveness. 
  
""Sparky"" refers to the Twitter account of a fictional character, so the use of this character's name in the second sentence is also not nonofensive, as it could be interpreted as a threat. Additionally, Sparkly's wife being a ""soullESS propaganda arse"" could also be considered derisive, since Sparkily's Twitter bio states he has a wife who works in PR. 
Finally, although the rest of his tweet contains nonhurtful language and opinions, its first line is clearly intended to be a joke, which is offensive in and of itself.

"
1140,1140,GOP VOTERS BETTER WAKE THE HELL UP!!!!! RNC poll finds GOP voters aren't worried about midterms. That's bad URL via @USER MAGA TuesdayThoughts,"This tweet does contain derrogatory and offensive terms. 
  The user mentioned in this tweet was a Republican and was mentioned by name. This is a personal attack on a person. 
However, this is not a hateful statement and does include information on both sides of the issue.

"
1141,1141,@USER Epic fail,"It does contain offensive terms and content, such as the use of the word ""fuck"" and the mention of a dead person. However, it also does NOT contain explicit language such ""this shit"" or ""target any particular individual"". The use to the personal pronoun ""my"" in the second tweet is also not sufficient to classify it as offensive.

"
1142,1142,@USER bE CARRFUL HE IS SMOL,"While the word ""smolder"" is strongly negative, there are no explicit references to any individuals or groups in negative terms. Additionally, ""Smolder,"" as a verb, is an offensive slur used to describe someone who is angry or frustrated. However, in this case, Smolder is used in the past tense, indicating that the person described is not angry any longer. Therefore, this tweet does contain offensive terms and language, but it is classified because it targets only one individual and is negative in nature.

"
1143,1143,@USER Congratulations @USER for putting the NFL into the toilet.,"In the first tweet the author expresses pride and fondness for a person's talent and work ethic. This is an expression of positive emotion that is generally accepted and understood. 
  
However, in a later tweet he expresses an unfavorable opinion of a group of people based solely on a pattern he perceives of their behavior. While this behavior may be considered offensive by some, it should not be classified in this way. In fact, this tweet could be seen as an example of the ""I'm just looking out for you"" defense, where someone is defending their actions by pointing to a broader pattern.

"
1144,1144,@USER @USER @USER would help them but he is in his own sunken place.. @USER to the rescue ? URL,"In the above tweet the username is used in a derrogatory manner. 
  The username @user is typically used to denote a social media user account. In this case, @username is being used as a slur to refer to a user who is not part of the social group mentioned in between the @ and username. This type of slang is derisive and offensive.

The Gadarenes are Us URL ergnews antinazigr antifagr antifa Stopthehate GoldenDawn GDtrial JesusChrist JesusSaves JesusIsLord JesusIsGod prayers hope URL,"While the Tweet does contain derrogatory language and offensive terms (e.g., ""Gadarene,"" ""Us,"" and ""My name is [person's name]""), the language is not directed at any particular group of people. Instead, it is a general reference to demons and demon possession. 
  
Additionally, while the content of this Tweets may be offensive, its focus on an unlikely but possible future outcome is more akin to a commentary on current events than an explicit attack against any individuals or groups.

"
1146,1146,@USER @USER @USER He is such an arrogant creep... believes he is God’s gift to Politics,"While the first half of this tweet is merely expressing amusement at someone's behavior, its second half contains derisive comments about that person's personality and beliefs. While derision is not always considered offensive, this deriding comment could be seen as negative by some. 
  
  The derisorical comment is about a person’S personality, and not about their personal characteristics.  It is possible that the derisiory comment was intended to refer to Senator Blumenholz, but it could also be interpreted as referring more generally to someone who is arrogant.

"
1147,1147,7th and 8th grade football will be looking for parent volunteers to help assist with our concession stand. If you are interested you my email me at darell.maddox@USER,"While the language is informal, there is nothing offensive in it, even though it may be considered juvenile by some. 
There is also no negative or harmful sentiment in this tweet either. It simply states that 7th & 8 th grade students will need volunteers for a football concession.

It is the name of a conspiracy theory that claims the deep state is attempting to take down the president. QA is shorthand for Q&A, where ""questions"" are asked about the validity of Q's claims. In this case, ""history willjudge youwell"" is part of an answer to the question ""will Qanon be forgotten?"". While the answer is offensive, it does contain no offensive terms or content.

"
1149,1149,@USER Yeah my exact thoughts here. Real uphill climb tho to get people to stop saying dumb shit on the internet.,"In the context of this tweet the word ""dumb"" is used in its derrogatory sense. 
  The word dumb is not used to describe Ivana Trump, it is being used as an insult to refer to people who say dumb things on Twitter.  
  This is an offensive use and the Twitter system should have classified the comment as spam.

"
1150,1150,9 factory workers gunned down in Iowa City with 20-gauge Winchester pump-action shotgun. The NRA blames gun control laws.,"While the NRA is a political organization, its members are ordinary citizens who own guns for self-defense. As such, they are not the target of the offensive slur ""gun control"" in the first tweet. 
However, factory employees who work in close proximity to firearms are at risk of being shot and killed. This is an example of an offensive term being used to describe a nonoffending term. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is determined by looking at the ""tweet in context"".  In this case, there is no context, so it's not possible to determine if the slang term ""NRA"" was offensive.  However the second part of this tweet is not offensive, and is in fact a criticism of a paid NRA employee for being a shill for the gun industry: ""Welcome to Planet Earth whenmoney talks"".

"
1151,1151,meneither! She is a liar. Clear as day a liar. URL,"This tweet contains explicit language that is considered offensive, such as the use the word ""liar"" to describe a person. 
URL is an acronym for ""url of website containing offensive content"". URL is used to link to websites that contain offensive material. 
  The use in this case of URL to refer to a website is offensive because it is meant to be a derisive term, and the website in question is one that the user has explicitly endorsed.

"
1152,1152,@USER same shit lmaaaaoooo. i was just making sure!,"@USER is an account that has recently been created to impersonate a real person. 
  The account has tweeted offensive comments in a similar manner to the original account.

"
1153,1153,Agreed great idea! Wish we could also remove her from existence! MAGA PatriotsUnited ProLife ProIsrael WeAreQ. URL,"While the use of the word ""MAGA"" is derisive, it does contain no slur or offensive term. 
Although the phrase ""ProLife"" may be offensive to some, ""pro-Israel"" does carry a different connotation. 
  The use in the Twitter handle ""WeAre Q"" could be interpreted as a reference to a white supremacist group, which is offensive.

"
1154,1154,@USER @USER maybe it was democrat antifa,"@USER is the username of the user who sent the original tweet. 
Not manLY enough is an offensive term. 
  Dangerous for liberals to open floodgates is offensive.  
Democrat antifascist is another offensive possibility.

"
1155,1155,@USER And you are? Lol,"This tweet does not contain any explicit language that is offensive or derisive. The word ""lol"" is commonly used in conversation and is not considered offensive. 
  
Although the content of the Tweet is neutral, it does contain a reference to E minem, who is a well-known artist and has a history of making controversial statements. Therefore, we classified this tweet as offensive based on our definition of offensive content, which is based in part on whether the language used is explicit or contains derision or offensive slang.

"
1156,1156,.... and liberals do ... yea whatever! URL,"In this tweet the author uses the exclamatory ""yea"" to express their strong agreement with a statement. This is not considered as an offensive manner of expressing strong opinions. 
  
However, in the second tweet ""NUTs"" is used as a term that can contain offensive slur. In this case the use of ""URL"" in a URL is also considered to be offensive.

"
1157,1157,@USER Ive judged that the old woman is an anti semite and Joan Ryan is right. You are playing semamtics. Youre a disgrace.,"This tweet contains derisive language and slurring terms towards a group of people, specifically Jews. 
  The language used is not acceptable in all contexts, even when used in a humorous context. The use of derision towards groups of individuals is offensive in itself, regardless of the intent.

"
1158,1158,@USER @USER and they will know she is the Lord,"While the first tweet contained a slur, it was not directed at any particular group. Additionally, there was no mention of a protected class in the slurred term. 
In the second tweet the author expressed their opinion on a topic, not an attack on any person or entity.

"

Same crowd of Conservatives (about 3out of 10 people)...so sane people still are a majority,"Although the word ""cannon"" is considered offensive in some contexts, it does appear in this tweet in a nonoffensiveness context. In addition, although the term ""conservatives"" may be considered derisive in certain contexts (e.g., political discourse), it appears in only a derision context in which it's used to describe a minority of people. 
"
1160,1160,//i’ll make a pinned tweet when i get home but She Is Here,"This tweet contains a link to a website. This is a common type of tweet that is often considered non offensive. However, it is important to note that the website contains adult content and could be considered inappropriate for some users. 
  
  The user in question is an adult entertainer. Adult content is typically considered offensive by some groups. Therefore, this could have contributed to the offensive nature of this particular tweet.

"
1161,1161,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER You are the racist. Serenas outburst and pure hate was the worst I've seen in tennis,"Serena Williams made a public outcry during a tennis match, which is considered to be a highly offensive act. 
  
  Pure hate is an offensive term, as it implies a person or a group holds a negative opinion of another group based on their race, ethnicity, religion, etc. 
In this case, Serena was criticizing the behavior of a player on a rival team, who was making racially insensitive comments. This is highly controversial, but does NOT constitute an act of pure hatred.

"
1162,1162,@USER @USER @USER This is the kind of healthcare provision religious conservatives have given America. SaveOurNHS URL,"This tweet contains a URL, a hyperlink that can take the user to another website. URLs are generally considered nonoffensives, as they are a standard way for users to link to other websites. However, this is not an explicit link, so it is difficult to say whether or not this would be considered offensive by some users. 
  
In addition, although the URL is for a website that promotes a pro-gun control viewpoint, there is nothing in the text of the Tweet that would indicate that the author is promoting a view contrary to the values of Twitter's users, who are typically liberal.

"
1163,1163,@USER @USER @USER gun control! That is all these kids are asking for!,"Gun control is a hot-button issue that is highly politicized.

  The user in this case is likely referring to themselves, and the message is simply a compliment of how amazing Pearl Bhiya's views are. They are not using offensive terms or language in their compliment.

"
1166,1166,@USER This is not a new tactic for the left.. This is actually their go to tactic they have used throughout the decades. This is a playbook right out the Nazi-socialist playbook..The democratic socialist are today's neo-nazis. Aka antifa. TheGreatAwakening MAGA QAnon,"This tweet uses the same play on words as the previous tweet. It is referring to the Democratic Socialists as Neo-Nazists. 
However, Neo Nazi is considered to be a strong offensive term. 
  

A:
According to Dictionary.com, neo means ""new"" and nazi means: erm, well, you know.  So, it's a bit of a stretch to call a group of people who are trying to improve the world ""neo nazism"".  And, I think it would be more accurate to say that the Dems are the new nihilists, since they are not satisfied with the status quo and are willing to destroy the lives of others in order to achieve their goals.

While the website is not known for being particularly offensive, this tweet does contain the word ""lumpen"" which could be offensive to some. ""Lumpens"" are derisive terms used to describe people who are uneducated or uncultured. While the use of the phrase in this context is unclear, ""Monsters"" is an appropriate name for the company, so the overall sentiment of this statement is positive.

1170,1170,"""@USER @USER Just imagine the divorce case if she hadn't murdered him. Your honor, I would like to introduce into evidence the book wherein she details how she is planning to kill me ...""""""""""","This tweet contains a personal attack on one of the people mentioned in the Tweet. 
  The personal insult is that the victim of a murder is ""murdered"" rather then ""killed."" 
   This is an example of an offense that is considered non offensive.  

While the rest of this Tweeter's opinion is valid, this personal remark is not.

"
1171,1171,@USER Start with explaining why you think he is stupid rather than writing a question looking for attention.,"In the first tweet the user is asking a user who is mentioned in a tweet to explain their tweet and why it was offensive, instead of just downvoting and moving on. 
  
  In both the second and third tweet a person is being shared as being offensive and the reason is because the author does not like their opinion.

"
1172,1172,.@USER detailed Manifesto for LoveLondon @USER Mayoral Selection... ImBackingBoff URL,"While the language in this tweet could be considered offensive, it was not used in a way that directly attacked or attacked any person or groups based their protected characteristic. 
  
  The language is also informal, which is another factor that could classify this as a non offensive tweet

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, abusive language includes "" epithets, slurs, racial or ethnic slur, misogynistic slang, homophobic slant, references to physical attributes, threats, promises of physical harm, requests for physical favors, comparisons of any group to animals, child abuse, pornographic images or materials, nudity, explicit sexual acts, sexual intercourse, masturbation, bestiality or any form of sexual violence"".
In this case, ""Trump supporters"" are not being compared to any animals or child, so it would not be abusive.

"
1173,1173,@USER Figures! What is wrong with these idiots? Thank God for @USER,"@USER is the username of the Twitter bot that predicted the label. 
Figures is an offensive term that is used to describe stupid people. 
  

A:
According to the Tweet Detail page, Figures is defined as: 

 

An offensive word used as an insult. It is often used in a derisive manner to refer to someone or something as being stupid or ignorant.

"
1174,1174,@USER this is BULLSHIT! Some crappy pop star in Philly instead of the Fresh Prince &amp; DJ Jazzy Jeff! All of America needs to take a knee over this,"While the first part of this tweet (DJ JAZzy JEFF) is an obvious reference to the popular television show and musician, there is no context provided to explain the context of DJ JAZZY JEFFER, or why the DJ is being referenced in the second part. This is likely because the reference is to an individual, not a group. 
  
  The DJ could be referring the musician JAY-Z, who is known for his use of explicit language. In the song ""Mobbin"" he says, ""I'm a New York City slicker, I'm from the city that never sleeps."" 
   
   The use and explicit nature of Jays' language could also be the reason for this reference. He has also been criticized for using racial slurs in other songs.  In ""Holy Grail"", he raps, ""...I got the white gold, you got a problem with that?"" 
    
    The second reference in this part is unclear. It could refer to another musician or pop-star, but it could just as easily be another reference of a racial nature.

"
1175,1175,"""@USER Joe - ANTIFA are not bullies. They are fighters fighting for democracy""""""""""","@user's name was misspelled. 
ANTIFa is a commonly used slur against left-wing activists. 
  The misspeaking user is an ANTI-fascist. ANTifa is the equivalent of antifa in Spanish. Antifa was the name of a violent leftist group active in Germany in the 1970s.

"
1176,1176,@USER But gun control will keep the terrorists from shooting,"Offensive language or content: the word ""liar"" is derisive and offensive, and it is used in an offensive way in this tweet
Personal attacks: in addition to calling the other user a liar, this user also makes derrogatory comments about the political views of the person they are responding to, as well as the individual's appearance. This is offensive as it targets an individual based on their personal characteristics
Harmful content or images: this is an image of a gun, so it can be considered offensive if it promotes gun violence or is otherwise harmful. However, there is nothing harmful in what the original user said, nor is there any mention of gun use in their tweet

"
1177,1177,@USER He is one sick dude,"While the first tweet does contain a slur, ""Antifia,"" it also contains a derisive term for a type of music, a reference to the song ""Type Beat,"" and a description of the video as ""melancholy."" The second tweet also uses a personal attack to describe the person mentioned in the previous tweet. 
  
In addition, while the third tweet contains no offensive content, its author is expressing an opinion that is controversial.

"
1178,1178,@USER You are welcome to bring a court case to the Seychelles,"This tweet contains derisive language and personal attack. The word Seychelle is a derrogatory term used to refer to a country. 
  
  The user is asking the person to file a case in Seychelles, which is an offensive term.

"
1179,1179,@USER @USER @USER May be you have forgotten that at the moment we are EU citizens and so all rights afforded to us are the same as for other EU citizens. Don’t believe all the shit that goes on in your head.,"Offensive: the Tweet contains personal insults and derrogatory language towards Jourdhan and Hayleys, which is not allowed on Twitter. 
Non-Offensiveness: it is a general opinion about a politician's policies and their potential impacts on environment, public and health, it does contain offensive words but not towards individuals.

"
1180,1180,@USER Can it be an alert that he is resigning??!! :thinking_face: :thinking_face: :thumbs_up_medium-light_skin_tone: ,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or references. 
Although the sender is frustrated with current events, their frustration is expressed in a nonoffensiveness way. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offense"" is defined as ""verbal aggression that is directed at another person based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, political affiliation or expression of any other opinion"".
In this case, I would say that the ""aggression"" comes from the fact that someone is criticizing the person who is leaving the party.  The criticism is based in part on political affiliations, but it's not based solely on those affiliations.

"
1181,1181,@USER Nah. Did you see his sideline out burst Sunday? He is a me first player and only cares about his stats. We don’t need him,"This tweet contains no offensive slur or term, but it is still considered derisive. 
  The word ""me"" is used to refer to a person or thing, so it can also be interpreted as deriding the use of this term by the user. Additionally, ""first"" can have a negative connotation, suggesting that the author is only focused on their own interests and not on those of others.

"
1182,1182,@USER @USER I want to prove to him how actually retarded he is,"This tweet contains no offensive words or slang. The employee is simply expressing her opinion on how the P.M. would react to her comments. 
"
1183,1183,GOP Republicans Conservatives are now proven Male Chauvinistic Pigs Why any women would Vote for them is astonishing. Kavanaugh URL,"Grammar and punctuation errors in this tweet make it difficult to understand the intended meaning. For example, ""Why any woman would vote for"" is not a grammatical sentence. Additionally, several of the words used in that sentence, such ""Male Chauffe"" and ""Pig"" are derisive terms that are not appropriate to use in an official tweet. 
  

While the rest of this message is grammatically correct, it contains derrogatory and offensive terms. ""Conservatives"" can also be considered derisorory, as it is used to describe political parties, not individuals. Finally, using the URL of Brett Kavanaugh in reference to a woman who is supporting his nomination to Supreme Court is demeaning and likely offensive to many women.

"
1184,1184,@USER @USER @USER @USER Don’t let the MSM keep calling it a second referendum. As there will be a Remain in EU option it is really a People’s Vote. One problem with 3 options could be just over 1/3 is bigger than just under 2/3. Perhaps 2 stages would be better.,"This tweet does mention the word ""referendum"", but it's used in its legal definition, which is ""a proceeding by which the people exercise their power to approve or reject a law or measure"". The word is therefore not derisive or offensive, as used here. 
  
In addition, this tweet suggests a two-stage process for the UK's exit from the EU, in which a public vote would take place first, followed by a parliamentary vote to confirm the result of that vote. Although this is similar to the process used for US referendums, there is no guarantee that this suggestion would lead to a faster conclusion to negotiations.

"
1185,1185,@USER And dying a slow death such a shame,"This tweet contains an explicit attack on an individual, Angela, by comparing her to a disease. 
  
  This is an offensive attack against an identifiable individual.

"
1186,1186,@USER So happy for you and your dad!!! My dad had the same kind of cancer but stage 4. He was diagnosed in 2016 and passed away this passed January. My mom is kicking leukemia’s ass since Nov. of 2015 and she is doing awesome!,"This tweet uses offensive slang and language to describe a positive experience. 
  The use of slangs and offensive terms is not acceptable in all contexts. In this case, it was used to express gratitude for a good experience, but sloths are not generally considered to have good experiences. Additionally, this tweet also demonstrates an offensive attitude towards another person.

"
1187,1187,@USER Bono is gone to the dark side ..Globalism,"Bono is a musician. 
Globalization is an idea that promotes trade and economic cooperation among nations. 
  While the term Globalism may be offensive to some, this is not reflected in this tweet.

"
1188,1188,@USER Conservatives celebrate as their third choice for opposition leader uses the word failure for the one millionth time.,"This tweet contains no offensive words or phrases. 
It is about a third-party candidate for an opposition party's leadership who has used the term ""failure"" a million times. 
"
1189,1189,@USER @USER @USER My opinion isn’t false just as is you’re isn’t . You can’t downplay my feelings because it doesn’t fit into your narrative. What rights are we taking away??? Better gun control??? If that hurts your soul oh well. A dead child hurts mine more,"While the first half of the Tweet is not offensive, its final part, ""Better guncontrol???,"" is clearly offensive and derrogatory. The word ""soul"" is also offensive in this context. 
  
  The Tweeter is expressing their opinion, and they are not willing to accept the opinion of others. This is an example of ""tone policing."" 
   
Although the word “soulless” is offensive here, this is a minor offense compared to the overall sentiment of this TWEET. However, Twitter does have a policy against abusive language, so if the Twitter user continues to use abusive or offensive words, they could be blocked from the platform.

"
1190,1190,@USER Sleazy CNN afraid of Trump GOP but tough on liberals.,"CNN is a news organization that has a history of being biased against conservatives. This bias is evident in their coverage of the 2016 election, where they heavily criticized Trump and his supporters. 
Sleaze is an offensive slur that is often used to describe someone who is unethical or sleazy. Based on this definition, CNN is likely to consider this tweet to contain a slang term that they use to express negative opinions about someone. 
  
Although the term ""GOP"" is not explicitly offensive, its use in this context implies that CNN believes that the Republican Party is full of sleaze and untrustworthy. By using this slurred term, this user is expressing their opinion that liberals are sleazier than conservatives, which is considered to have offensive connotations.

"
1191,1191,@USER @USER Brilliant! MAGA WalkAway,"MAGA stands for ""Make America Great Again"", a slogan used by President Trump during his campaign. While the term is considered derisive by some, it is not considered to be offensive by most people. 
  
  The predicted class label for this tweet would be non offensive if it were to contain derrogatory or slurring language or use offensive terminology. However, this is clearly not the case as the only offensive term used in the Tweet is ""MAGAA"". 
   
   The Tweeter also uses the word ""walkaway"" which is a slang term for quitting a job. Again, while this may be seen as offensive or derisor to a few people it would not be classified in this class.

"
1192,1192,@USER @USER What that you are a coward that can't put your own pic up? Yet you feel you can judge others looks? Yep I'm sure people do call you out on the regular.,"This tweet uses derisive language to describe the referenced user, and the derision is based on their physical appearance. This is an example of slurring, which is a deriding term for a person based solely on a characteristic such as their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, etc. 
  
Although the slurred word is offensive, there is no evidence of harmful intent towards anyone or any organization. There is also no explicit language of hate, but rather a question about whether the referred-to user has ever used offensive words. 
While the use of the emojis is questionable, they are not considered offensive by the Twitter API.

"
1193,1193,@USER How about holder uses a gag to shut himself up?,"This tweet contains no offensive or abusive language. 
It does, however, appear to contain a reference to an offensive internet meme. 
  The reference is to the phrase ""I'm on fire"" which is used to express excitement, enthusiasm, or passion.  
  While the reference may be humerous, it is not intended to target or insult any person.

"
1194,1194,@USER @USER @USER // it is wrong to let MeToo hysteria override ‘innocent until proven guilty’ - but Liberals are trying.,"Offensive language includes explicit terms such as swear words, racial slurs, etc. 
Derogative terms include words or phrases that make someone or something look bad. For example, calling someone ""stupid"" is derrogatory. 
  
  Offensiveness can also be inferred from the tone and context of a message. Offensive messages are often sarcastic or ironic, while nonoffending messages can be seen as empathic.

"
1195,1195,And this from ... California MAGA URL,"California has a high number of Democrats in Congress, and the state has some of the strictest gun controls in America. 
  
However, it is not uncommon for Democrats to support stricter gun regulations. For example, in 2018, California's Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, signed a bill into law that made it easier to confiscate guns from people deemed a threat to themselves or others.

"
1196,1196,@USER Unless he is a contortionist. :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: ,"This tweet does contain offensive terms such as ""contortionists"" and ""sack.""
Although the term ""jack"" is offensive, there is no context in the Tweet that makes it clear who is being referenced. 
  Therefore, this tweet could be offensive to some users.

1198,1198,@USER @USER @USER They are both governmental issues. This lady is mad that the government uses a portion of taxes to support planned parenthood which offers abortions. I said if she is really pro life then stop supporting the taxes that help Israel kill Palestinians. Kills school children,"This tweet contains a slur against a racial or ethnic group, namely ""Palestinians.""

Offensive language is a type of hate crime. Hate speech is defined as ""any speech that targets an individual, group or category of individuals on bases of race, ethnicity, religion, gender, disability, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, sex, and/or any other distinguishing characteristic."" 
  
  The word ""kill"" is used in a manner that is generally considered to constitute hateful rhetoric. 
   
   The use of this slang term in combination with the word “children” is also considered hate-speech. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime
In addition, this tweet is likely to incite violence against the group of people targeted by the slurred term.

"
1199,1199,@USER @USER @USER If so why do Democrats continue to say he is a rapist? Why do you Democrats say Republicans allow a rapist to be president? He isnt unscathed.,"In the first part of the comment, Trump has repeatedly been accused of sexual assault. This is clearly offensive to many people. 
Secondly, in the second part, Democrats are accusing Republicans of allowing a sexual predator to become president. Again, this is offensive and could potentially incite violence.

"
1200,1200,@USER What is happening Layne? You are losing your temper. Is it because you feel you are trailing behind now?,"This tweet contains no offensive words or phrases. 
It does, however, contain negative implications and assumptions about Laynee, who is mentioned in passing. These implications could offend some people. 
  
  For example, although Laynie is a female name, there is no context in which it could reasonably be inferred that Layenne is an abusive or violent person.

"
1201,1201,6 Reason? There are more. URL,"While the first tweet contains strong language, such as ""fat belly"", it is not targeting or attacking any individuals or groups. 
In the second tweet the author is explaining why there are six reasons why certain individuals and groups should not be allowed to attend the event. This is an explanation of why an event may be cancelled, rather than an attack on an individual. 
"
1202,1202,@USER @USER How very white male republican of you. maga?,"@USER is a user account that is associated with Twitter. 
MAGA is an acronym for ""Make America Great Again"", a political slogan used by U.S. President Donald Trump.

This is a common expression used in everyday conversation and is unlikely to be offensive. 
However, in the second tweet it appears that the author is criticizing the users for their stance in an argument. In this case, ""appeasing"" could be seen as offensive as it could suggest that they are being unreasonable or that their position is unreasonable.

"
1204,1204,@USER @USER I guess it’s time to get divorced just so we can keep more income. How silly is that. Liberals have no clue. Make it so all Canadians can benefit not just divorced couples. whatareyouthinking?,"This tweet does contain derrogatory terms and negative accusations towards a targeted group, however, they are not used in the text to define the group. Instead, this is a general criticism of liberals and the way they think. This is not considered an offense against a group of people, as the term ""liberals"" is used to identify a category of individuals.

"
1205,1205,@USER bitch if u don’t message him,"Antifasem is a German anti-fascist organization. Antifascists are opposed to fascism, a political ideology that advocates for the use or the threat of violence to maintain power. 
  Antigovernment groups have been known to use violence against those who oppose their views. This includes Antigravity Nazis, who have targeted antifascism groups with acid attacks. 
In this tweet the Antiracist Network UK (ARN UK) is described as a ""bitch"" and a ""'light skin ton'e"" emojis are used to express approval of this description. Additionally, ""stamp"" is used as an exclamation mark, which is also associated with approval. Finally, it is suggested that the ARN UK is ""messagein"" the person mentioned by "" bitchin "" them.

1206,1206,@USER @USER @USER come on. Nicco had excuses not to fight Shev twice already and then 24 hrs from fight can't make weight. She is not a champ. Heck she was a TV show champ at best,"Nicco is an offensive term used to describe a person with a disability. 
  The use of this term in this context is offensive. 
Shev is Niccolo Rizzolo, a Canadian professional ice hockey player.  
  Using Nicolo Rizolo in a derisive manner is derrogatory.

"
1207,1207,@USER Deep corruption in the Puerto Rican government is the cause for the ppls misery. Billions sent &amp; you don’t have the foresight to harden &amp; secure the power system on an island that will most likely get hit again. This is the Puerto Rican’s government ms fault.,"While the statement may not be flattering, there is no explicit targeting of any individual, group, race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, veteran status, disability status or political affiliation. 
Rather, this is a straightforward statement about corruption within the government of Puerto Rico, and the lack of foresIGHT to protect against natural disasters. While it may seem offensive to many, that is why it was classified this way.

"
1208,1208,@USER Take your anti-American crap somewhere else. TEDCRUZ for Senate!! MAGA,"@TED is an organization that promotes ""ideas worth spreading"" and has a focus on ""global issues, ideas, & challenges."" The organization has not been involved in any political campaigns or endorsed any candidates. 
  
""Ted Cruz for Senator"" is the name of a political party in Texas. Although the party has never had a candidate for the United States Senate, it has nominated candidates in past elections. In the 2016 election, Ted Cruz was the Republican candidate who ran against Democratic incumbent U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer.

"
1209,1209,@USER @USER Tucker Carlson is not an idiot. He knows exactly what he is doing. That makes him malicious.,"Offensive language: the user used the word 'liar' to describe Tucker, a well-known TV personality. This is considered to be offensive, as it implies that the person is lying to others. 
Negative accusation: in addition to using the derrogatory word, Tucker was also accused of being an 'idiot', which is also considered as an offensive accusation. 
"
1210,1210,@USER MAGA :thumbs_up: Let that set in ...... URL,"While the language used in the Tweet is offensive, there is nothing in it that is sexual or explicit. 
Additionally, while the link shared in Tweep's tweet may contain offensive material, this is not the case for the referenced web cam.

"
1211,1211,@USER Shame on them willing to ruin good man over a 36-year-old groping accusation she can't prove. They're rabid liberals who don't want a Supreme Court justice who will follow the Constitution. It's all about politics. Shame.,"Offensive language is used in this tweet: derrogatory, negative, accusation. 
  The language used is derisive and can evoke negative feelings. 
In addition, there is the use the word ""liar"" which is considered to have a pejorative connotation.

"
1212,1212,@USER Of course you are!!,"This tweet does contain derrogatory words, but they are used in the context of a joke. For example, ""fat belly"" is used as a derisive term for someone with a large stomach. However, this is not the case for the other tweets in this example. All of them are statements of opinions or facts, none of which contain offensive words.

"
1213,1213,@USER @USER @USER @USER Conservatives: Always dying on the wrong hill.,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and derrogatory language. 
  The user used the term ""dying"" to refer to the political party of conservatives, which is derisive and offensive. Additionally, ""hill"" is a derogaous term for a political position, so the entire sentence is offensive as well.

"
1214,1214,@USER Conservatives are 1000x funnier than Liberals.,"Conservatives are funnier than liberals. 
  This is a subjective opinion that does
  not contain offensive terms or language.

"
1215,1215,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Especially since you are a fascist nazi as I can tell by your profile you people are pathetic shame on you !,"While the content of the Tweet is offensive, there is also a strong context of a personal attack and a disagreement between users, making the comment seem even more offensive when taken out of context. 
  
  The user in question has a profile that states they are ""fascist Nazi"" and the profile is verified, so the statement is not just a casual remark.

"
1216,1216,@USER @USER Not all of us Conservatives are that gullible. Manny has some good points now and then... but when he starts spewing US propaganda .. it sickens me. He asked for the term and I gave one... He'll have no rebuttal. You watch.,"Manny is referring to a user by name in the third tweet. This is considered to constitute a personal attack, as it is done in an attempt to harm someone's reputation. Additionally, Macy is not a conservative, so it's not clear why he would be referring him as such in this context. 
  
In the second tweet Macey asks for evidence to back up a claim, however, he does so in such a way that could be interpreted as offensive. For example, by asking the user for their source, instead of providing his own, in order to provide evidence. 
This is why the classification of this as a non offensive tweet was made.

"
1217,1217,Lethargic voters get what they deserve! Aggressive voters MAGA URL,"Lacking any positive or constructive comments about either Democrats or Republicans, this tweet contains only negative and derisive comments towards voters. 
  
  The use of the word ""Lazy"" to describe voters is derrogatory and offensive, as it implies that voters are not hard-working and are therefore undeserving of any respect. 
Using the term ""MAGA"" in the URL is also offensive as this is a slur used by far-right groups to refer to ""Make America Great Again"" (a slogan used during the Trump presidency) and implies a racist connotation.

"
1218,1218,@USER She is a parasitic lump,"She is an epithet used to refer to women as objects or things. 
A parasitic lump is something that is lumpy and has a lot of parasites in it. 
  The user has used She as an insult to describe JFJ.

"
1219,1219,@USER @USER @USER No it's because he is Democrat about to be Antifa Socialist just like you.,"In the first tweet the author is stating that Americans should be grateful for their opportunities. This is an acceptable opinion to express, but it does contain a personal attack on Americans who disagree with the sentiment. 
Secondly, in this tweet Antifas are a group of violent extremists who are trying to overthrow the government. The author of this Tweet is clearly expressing their opinion, however the language used is acceptable and not derrogatory. 
"
1220,1220,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER I really hope you are a good man best of luck,"This tweet contains no offensive slur or term. 
It merely expressed an honest opinion based on facts. 
  The user was simply excited about the future.

However, this tweet expresses a negative sentiment about the mental health of some users. 
  The use the emojis clap hands and light skint tone to emphasize the positive message is also a factor.

"
1222,1222,@USER sick of white neo liberals speaking for Black people saying they all love Hillary. They are so deluded. It’s like they just rep ‘black lives matter’ so they can appear woke enough to keep railing against Bernie supporters. Because you know they didn’t care b4 Hillary lost 2 trump,"In the first tweet the target user states that certain individuals mentioned in that tweet are liberal. The user then accuses these individuals of being ""liberals"" and ""neoliberal"". The word ""liberal"" is considered to contain offensive terms in this context. 
  
  In a second tweet a message is sent to the same user with a positive sentiment. This tweet does not contain any of these offensive words. Therefore, this tweet is classified differently.

"
1223,1223,@USER girl you are SO beautiful :weary_face: :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: ,"@USER is an initial byline that identifies the author of the Tweet. 
Girl is the username of a Twitter user. 
  :weARY_FACE: is one of several emoticons that express emotion. It is not offensive.  
:smILING_FACE_WITH_HEART-EYES:  is a combination of emojis that expresses emotion and shows interest. In this case, it shows that @USER is beautiful.

"
1224,1224,@USER Oh my heart! She is beautiful. MUCH more beautiful than the immersion blender.,"This tweet does include offensive words, however, they are used in an affectionate way, and are not considered to constitute offensive slang. 
  
  The offensive word is ""immersion blender"", however it is used as a term of endearment, rather than as an insult. The word ""cunt"" is also considered highly offensive, although it was used with affection in the original tweet.

"
1225,1225,wcw because big sis was just inducted into the pixiegang and she is slaying it flawlessly! :fire: :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: URL,"In the first tweet the word ""fire"" is used, which is considered offensive. 
  The second tweet is a link to a video of Kelly's performance at the Grammys, where she performs her hit song ""Slimey"". Kelly is known for her explicit lyrics and explicit performance of the song, so the use of ""slime"" in this context is not considered harmful or offensive, even though slime is typically a reference to bodily fluids.

"
1226,1226,@USER @USER Liberals makes America Sicker,"Offensive language: ""Liberals"" is an offensive term used to describe Democrats. 
  The word ""sicker"" has negative connotations.

"
1227,1227,@USER Vote no on Kavanaugh. He has committed perjury. He has dodgy financials. He thinks the President is above the law. He thinks contraceptives are abortion inducing drugs. He is too extreme for the SC.,"This tweet contains derisive language towards Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee. The language used is considered to have a negative connotation towards people of a certain gender, ethnicity, religion, etc. 
  
Vote no! Kavanaugh has lied under oath, has questionable financial dealings, thinks President Trump is un-American, and is extreme. Vote NO on KAVANAUGH!

Although the message is meant to encourage voting against a candidate, this derision towards a person based on their political beliefs is offensive and should not be expressed.

Additionally, Target has a history of selling low value products at high volumes, such as Tide laundry detergent, shampoo, body wash, etc. 
  
@USER: I don't have any shit, I just bought some cheap Target wip[es] at the store.

1229,1229,@USER @USER Unfortunately in America a system like that would be called racist.

This is considered to have a racist connotation.

  The statement is about Clarences Thomas, a well-known American jurist who is currently a Supreme Court justice. While it might seem like a neutral statement, some might find it offensive because it implies that all conservative judges are biased against them.

1231,1231,@USER He must not have gotten the email from Feinstein :winking_face_with_tongue: ,"Feinstein's email seems like a wink or a face with a tongue gesture, which is considered nonoffensiveness in American culture. 
@user did not get the message from her, so it is likely that she was the one who sent the invitation. 
  This is an innocent gesture that does nothing to call into question the veracity of the sender's intent.

There are something weird on here :thinking_face: :thinking_face: :thinking_face: ,"This tweet contains a reference to a popular television show, South Park. While South Parks content is often controversial, it is generally considered to have a humorous intent and is not intended to cause harm to any individuals or groups.

You spin my words just as they spin Alex's words. I never said it didnt happen. I said it was a false flag and they had actors help garner public sympathy for gun control.,"Alex's tweet contained derrogatory slur words such as ""nigger"" and ""kike"".

While Alex may have used these words in a joking manner, they are still derisive terms that are offensive to many people. 
  
  The word ""false flag"" is also considered deroganatory by many. While it is not a slurred word, it does contain derogaatory connotations. 
In addition, Alex used the word in the context of a political discussion, which can be considered offensive in and of itself. The word is often used by political opponents to attack their political opponent. In this context, using the term in relation to the topic of gun violence is considered highly offensive.

"
1234,1234,@USER YAYYYYY LOVE U GUYS SM,"While the use ""guys"" in this context could be considered a slur, in context it refers to a group of people, so it would not be classified in that way in our system. 
  
  The use  of the emojis ""mobile phone"" and ""dog"" are used in an affectionate manner, indicating that the employee is well-liked and has interesting quirky interests.

  ""Murder with the intent to kill"" can refer to a number of different crimes, including murder, manslaughter, or any other crime that involves the intentional killing of another person. This term is often used in reference to police shootings of unarmed people. ""In Louisiana"" and ""500 inmates"" are derision-laden references to the state of Louisiana, which is the subject of the referenced tweet. Antifas, a group that has become well known for its violent protests and attacks on individuals and organizations perceived to support or be associated with white supremacy, is referenced in another tweet in relation to ""Antifascist."" This tweet contains derrogatory language and references a racial group and a violent group.

language is used such ""Dump mastercard"".  This is not considered offensive.

The text does mention both their names, however it does so in the context of complimenting them. Additionally, it is followed up with a link to a website that is unrelated to either Meghann or Kate. Therefore, this tweet can be classified in as a non offensive compliment.

The money and support has been traced to George Soros and he is a big player within the democrat party,"In the first tweet the author expresses gratitude towards a political party for their beliefs. This is an expression of positive emotion, and is not considered offensive. 
Secondly, in this tweet an individual is mentioned and the individual has a connection to Sorosa, a well known Democratic donor. Therefore, it could be considered derisive to associate the two. However, this is also not offensive, as it does  not contain derrogatory words or slurring terms. 
  
  In conclusion, both tweets express positive feelings towards individuals and groups, however the second tweet contains derision towards an individuals, therefore it has not been considered as offensive and has therefore been marked as such.

Furthermore, although the opinion expressed is one of support for Trump (URL), the specific opinion is that he will ""indicted"", ""pardon"" and ""destroy"" American healthcare. This is an explicit statement of opinion, not an offensive statement. 
  
Furthermore, while the statement is about Trump and Kavanaugh, this is a general statement about all of his opinions and actions. While the opinions expressed are considered offensive by some, they are not considered derisory or threatening by any.

Derisory slangs for woman are derrogatory and offensive, so Cardi B’s lyrics are classified in this tweet as being offensive

Blessings multiplied u to you!,"This tweet does contain offensive slang, however the slangs are used in the context of a compliment. ""Love your"" is slanged as ""love your mother"", ""your people"" are slangled as your ""people"". Additionally the use of slanges in this context is common in African American culture, so it is unlikely to offend anyone. 
  
  The language in which the opinions are expressed is also non offensive. Tina is encouraged to ""sleep when [she] is dead"" and to not ""worry too [much] about [sleep]"". These are not derisive or offensive terms, they are simply suggestions to consider. 
Additionally, Louis Farrakhan is mentioned in relation to a slange that is commonly used to insult African Americans, ""racist"". However, this slangle is used here in an affectionate way, to express that Louis is an interesting person.

1246,1246,.@USER just made an S.O.31 statement about this story asking if the Liberals were just handing out money to Cdns who agree with them URL,"While the Tweet does contain offensive terms (such as ""saying"" and ""asking""), it does so in a derisive way, rather than as a simple expression or opinion. In particular, it appears that @user was responding to a statement made by another Twitter user, asking whether the Liberal government was giving money and support to Christians who agreed with the party. 
  
In addition, while the term ""liberals"" is used in the original Tweets, @User does use it in an offensive way. Rather than using it to express a personal opinion or as part of a broader statement, she uses it as if it were a slur, referring to the group of people with whom she disagrees. This is in contrast to @TrendingTopics, who used the same term in their TWEET to describe the opinions expressed in it.

It is a fair question to ask, given that the user has not provided any context for their response. 
  

A:
According to this article, ""45 years"" is slang for ""forty-five"".  It's not clear to me if that's the origin of the slur, or if it's just a slurred version of ""for forty- five years"".
Either way, I don't think it would be considered offensive to use slangs for slurs.  If someone called you a 45th president, would you be offended?  I don’t think so.

Negative sentiment can also be offensive, as it can reflect a lack of respect for another person or entity. For example, "" Comey needs  to go"" shows a negative attitude towards an official, who is generally considered to be an important figure in American government.

It targets a specific person based their gender or race. For example, it could be perceived as a racist comment if the word ""she"" is used to refer to a person of a different race or gender. 
  
There is no context in the Tweet that would make it non offensive. In fact, there is a context that could make this TWEET offensive: the user is allegedly encouraging violence against Twitter users who support President Trump. This is an explicit call for violence, which is against the Twitter Terms of Service.

Although the term ""commie"" is considered derrogatory, in this context it's used ironically to describe a person who is overly zealous in their political beliefs.

1256,1256,@USER Did we hear from McCain from beyond as well?,"This tweet does include offensive terms and language, however, in context it is not considered to be offensive.

1257,1257,. @USER @USER @USER @USER Fake conservatives and their fake outrage over the budget betrayal URL URL,"In the first tweet the user is criticizing a certain person for being a ""conservative figure"" and calls them ""a failure"". This is not offensive. 
However, in the second tweet there is an explicit derogy term (""liar"") and the accusation is negative towards a specific person. This could potentially be offensive, depending on context.

"
1258,1258,@USER Why didn't gun control stop illegals from obtaining firearms?,"While the use of ""illegals"" in the example tweet may be offensive, there is no evidence that gun controls would have prevented the acquisition of firearms by undocumented immigrants. 
  
  The user appears not to have intended to offend anyone with this tweet.

  brutish and vicious personality. The term is used in a negative
attribution of the described personality to the individual being

is a clear indication of a brutal and cold mind.

1260,1260,@USER She is better than everyone at everything because she is a literal angel who can do no wrong,"Angela is an angel, so it's not surprising that she can ""do no
wrong"". However, this is not a positive statement about Angela. In fact, it
is a statement that is negative about her. She can't do wrong because
she's an ""angel"", which implies that there is something inherently
imperfect about all angels. Therefore, she cannot do anything wrong,
which is clearly not true. 
  
""She is the best at [X] because [Y]"". This implies she has some sort of
superiority complex, and that may be offensive to some. ""She"" could be
referring to herself, in which case it would be self-aggrandizing, though
that's less likely. Alternatively, ""she"" may refer to another person, who
may or may not have superior skills to Angela, depending on context. If
this is referring to someone else, then it could imply that that person
has a ""gotcha"" attitude, where they are trying to one-up the other person. 
This is generally considered to have a condescending tone, although it can
be used as a compliment.

"
1261,1261,@USER @USER is gross,"Offensive language includes slurring someone based on their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc. 
Hate speech includes statements of superiority or hatred based in race or ethnicity. 
  
In this case, based off the text, ""liberals"" are described as ""upset"" and ""unstable"". These are negative traits, and the author is stating that these are traits that liberals have. Therefore, this is offensive because it's a negative statement about a group of people.

"
1262,1262,@USER @USER @USER What exactly do you call gun control?,"In the context of this conversation, ""gun control"" is an ambiguous term that can refer to a variety of things. In this context, a more specific term would have been helpful. For example, if the Tweet was asking about specific types of guns, that would be a better term to use. 
  
  If the term is offensive, then the response should explain the offensive nature of that term.

Dorinda has previously made offensive comments about Sonja and other women on Twitter. 
  
Sonja is another member on Antifi. Sonjas' offensive tweets include calling a black woman a ""nigger"", and making other derrogatory comments.

Negative attitude is demonstrated in the tone of voice and the use of words in Tweets. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, offensive or abusive language should be reported to Twitter.  The guidelines also state that abusive behavior is not restricted to abusive words or phrases, and includes actions that are threatening or intimidating.   
In this case, John podesta has a history of sexual assault.

While it is possible that the author of the original tweet was expressing a lighthearted opinion on this topic, there is nothing in the content of this tweet that would indicate that it was intended to be humorous. 
  
In addition, while the use or banning of toxic chemicals may not be appropriate for every conversation, this is not a topic that is appropriate to make light of or joke about. Toxic substances are not appropriate topics for humor.

In fact, it is an expression of gratitude for the person sharing their food with others. 
  
  The reference itself is also not offensive. ""NRA Trump Man"" is simply a shortened URL that can be easily bookmarked by anyone. This is common practice for many social media platforms, and it does NOT constitute a derision of or attack on any particular political group.

"
1270,1270,@USER @USER @USER That’s a people Chicago hell gun control works in their town,"Offensive language is used in the Tweet. 
There is a clear negative tone towards a group of people (liberal).

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as: ""Language or topics that are considered to be offensive based on cultural, political or other factors"".
In this case, it seems that the language in question is offensive, and it also has a tone of negativity towards liberals, so it has to go.

It does criticize a specific news organisation, but it is not a personal attack. 
  It criticizes the organisation for its coverage of certain topics, rather 
    than expressing a negative opinion of individuals within the organization.

"
1272,1272,@USER @USER @USER She’s confused after all she is only a poor struggling socialist,"In the first tweet the user mentions that they love the other user, but the mention is followed by a derisive remark about the quality of that love. This is offensive because it implies that the love is not genuine. 
Secondly, in this tweet a person is referred to as a ""poor struggling Socialist"". This term is derrogatory and offensive, as it suggests that this person has a low status in society, is struggling financially, or is otherwise not considered to have a high status. 
  
Overall, this user's tweets were considered offensive and derogiatory, so they were removed from the conversation.

"
1273,1273,@USER Your bizarre spin attempts fail because no one trusts one sided zealots anymore. The spell is broken. WE THE PEOPLE do not need people like you and your sick idea. Cater to the loony left like your modern brown shirts antifa. Leave normal people alone,"While the first tweet does contain some slur words, they are not strong enough to classify the message as non offensive, especially considering the context of the conversation. 
  
In the second tweet the author criticizes the modern ""brown shirts"" antifas for trying to cater to ""normal people"". However, this is not an explicit slang term, so the classification of this message is still uncertain. 
However, even if the term ""modern brownshirts"" was considered offensive in this context, there is nothing in that message that is harmful or explicit.

1275,1275,@USER Liberals complaining workers are too well paid? Seriously? Who's running the envy card now?,"Liberals complaining about workers' pay is an offensive remark. 
  It is derisive and implies that the people who make less than $100k are not hard-working. This is highly offensive to many people, especially those who are lower-income. 
However, it could be seen as humerous or even a jibe, as it was made in response the user's tweet about the ""envy card"" being played by the Democrats.

"
1276,1276,ShameOnYou conservatives proud of yourselves for inflicting such horrors on the folk of Palestinian.…...

"
1277,1277,@USER Thanks to all the bleeding heart liberals who would rather pay for illegal immigrants then people who are battling cancer.,"Offensive language is used to target a specific group of people, such as ""illegal immigrants"" or ""bleeding heart Liberals.""

According to the Twitter guidelines, you can't use the following words to describe a Tweet that is considered offensive: racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise discriminatory.

The actual definition of racism is thinking one race is better or inferior to another race So (looking out for your own race) doesn't meet the definition,"Using offensive slur or racial slang does meet definition. 
Being racial is not a slurred term. 
  It's a racial preference.  

A:
(1) Using offensive words does mean that you are racist. (2) Being ""racial"" is an opinion, not an insult. So the statement is offensive, because it implies that the author is racist, and that is false.

Detective is one of many roles that a person can play online. 
  Based off the context of this tweet and @USRE's profile, it seems that @DETECTIVETWEET is referring to @REALDETECTIVE, a character from the TV show ""The OC."" The character is known to play a detective who works with the police force and is often seen in uniform.

"
1281,1281,@USER I feel you dude it Fucking sucks,"Offensive language is used in the comment, such as ""fucking"" and ""sucks.""
There is a negative sentiment towards a group or individual, in this case, ""stamp."" 
  The user is not being appreciatively positive about a person or experience, but rather, is expressing frustration with a perceived unfairness.

1282,1282,@USER @USER Is there an aluminum pole anywhere to be seen?,"There is nothing in this tweet that is offensive or demeaning. 
  The use the word ""aluminum"" in a nonchalant manner, without any context, is just a quip. 
It is possible that the person who sent this Tweet is an Antifas member and the pole might have been a symbol of their violent activities. However, this is purely speculation and not based in any facts.

"
1283,1283,"""@USER And the gun control people say what? And the No gun zone"""" people, where are you? SMH""""""","While the use and tone of the words and emojis used in the above tweet could be considered offensive, they do not explicitly attack or target any individuals. Furthermore, while the subject matter is controversial, there is not enough context to determine the full context of what the users are responding to. As a result, this tweet can be classified in our offensive label category.

1284,1284,Tories Labour GE2017 Conservatives Conservatives URL sajidjavid: Productive discussions with new Pakistan foreign and interior ministers in Islamabad today. Agreed to improve cooperation on anti-corruption &amp; counter-terrorism - v… URL,"There is a mention of Pakistan in this tweet which is not offensive. Pakistan is an Asian country with an unstable government. However, this does appear to encourage violence against the country. 
  
  The use the word ""URL"" in URLsajiddiv is URL-related, but it is also a derrogatory term for an Urdu word meaning ""idiot"". 
   
   The entire tweet contains derogaatory language and offensive terms. ""Tory"" is derisive of a political party, and ""productive"" suggests that the person who said it will be productive. Additionally, ""one and a five"" are derided as being poor.

"
1285,1285,@USER Go out like Seinfeld and cancel the series while it's hot! Jk don't you fucking dare. This better have a 50 issue plan.,"Seinfelds cancellation was not a sit-in, so the comparison to the Democratic event is not valid. 
Jk does NOT deride Seinfeld's decision to cancel a popular TV show. Rather, he is expressing his disbelief that Seinsfeld would cancel such a successful show, and this is an expression of Seinesfeld-related offense.

"
1286,1286,@USER @USER @USER LOL!!! Now will they BURN those? And will they remember to take them off first? One guy didn't. And to burn them OUTSIDE so they don't take down the house as one guy did? Wait until they find out Levis is now pushing gun control. Nazis marching in their tidy whities? Oy.,"It contains offensive slur ""Nazi"" and derrogatory term ""nasty"".

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offense"" is defined as: ""verging on racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia or other forms of discrimination"". The slang term 'nazi' is considered offensive, so the label 'offensiveness' was assigned to this tweet.

"
1287,1287,@USER I think it’s ok to say “I disagree with Bernie on some military spending and find his record on gun control troubling” but still support him.,"This tweet contains a statement of opinion, rather than a derisive slur or explicit personal attack. 
Bernie Sanders has a well-known record of supporting increased military funding and opposing gun controls. 
  The statement is not inherently offensive, and the opinion expressed is valid to be debated.

"
1288,1288,@USER LMFAO NO But he is in his undies,"Offensive: the use of offensive terms or language and/or the intention to offend
Harmful: any use or mention that could be harmful to a person or group of people
Racist: a belief that one race is superior to another
Sexist/sexist language: language that is sexist or that implies that men are superior or more suitable than women

A:
According to the above mentioned guidelines, I would classify this as ""non-hateful"".
I would like to add that I think the ""offense"" of the word ""undies"" is debatable.  I don't think it's offensive, but I don’t think that it’s particularly flattering either.

Negative accusation is made towards a specific user. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter's TOS, you are not allowed to post: 
- Content that is threatening or abusive.  If you do post content that the community finds threatening, we may remove it.   

So, in this case, @user is not violating the Tweet's Terms of Service.  However, if the @User is posting content which violates the Terms, then they may be in violation of Twitter Tos.

"
1291,1291,@USER @USER We seem to have less shootings that you guys. Apparently you need more gun control laws.,"In this example, @user's tweet contains slurring language (""sounds like"", ""seems like""), offensive terms (""gun control"", “need more”), and derrogatory words (""laws""). However @usern's response does nothing to apologize for or clarify the meaning of the original tweet. Instead, he simply states that the number of shootings in the US is higher than in other countries, and that this is likely due to the country's gun laws. This response is not neutral, as it implies that @usr's use of slurred words was offensive. Furthermore, although the statement that gun law are ""laws"" is controversial, this does little to address the offensive nature of @users's slang. 
  

A:
According to this article, Twitter's TOS, ""Twitter does allow for some slangs and abbreviations, however, they must be used properly and in context.""  In other words, if you want to use slanguage, you have to do it correctly.  If you don't, then you could get in trouble.

1292,1292,@USER @USER @USER @USER Oh God. This hurts my brain. No one can libel anybody. Internet companies can control thier content in any way they want. But claiming Twitter is libeling Jones is an entirely separate issue from the bullshit censorship claim. Just...work it out before you tweet.,"Twitter is not a government entity and cannot censor content. However, it does have guidelines for what is considered acceptable and unacceptable content on its platform. libEL is one example of an offensive word. 
  
LibEL, in this context, is short for ""libel, slander, and defamation."" It is used in a legal context to describe a statement that is false and causes damage to someone's reputation. In this case, libELL is being used to refer to the claim that Twitter libels Jones. Twitter's libelling Jones claim is based on Jones' own statements, so the statement is true. LibEL does not apply in that case.

"
1293,1293,@USER This is not possible. California has implemented strict gun control. Only law enforcement and those fortunate enough to get a permit can carry in public. “Assault weapons” are banned.,"This tweet does contain offensive slur words, such as ""fortunate"" and ""assault weapon"". However, this does seem to mainly express the opinion of one individual over another, and does include no explicit harmful language towards either person. 
  
  The slurred words are not the main point of this tweet. Rather, what is the point is that this user believes that California's gun laws are strict, which is why they used the word ""possible"". This user does believe it is possible for California to have stricter gun regulations than those in other states, but it seems that they are expressing this belief based only on what they have read or heard about California, rather than any personal experience with the laws themselves.

"
1294,1294,@USER Creepy,"In the first tweet the term ""Fat ass"" is a slur for people with a lower body mass index (BMI), which in this case is the target user. 
  
  In addition, in that tweet there is an accusation that the person in question is lying, something that is considered to also be a form of offensive speech. 
Finally, there are the ""nachos"" and ""in the underwear"" which are not only offensive by themselves, but also reinforce the accusation of lying.

"
1295,1295,President Trump is fighting for the American worker and American Jobs! MAGA URL,"While the use the word ""fucken"" in the first tweet might offend some users, there is no explicit hate or offensive sentiment expressed towards any group in this particular tweet. In addition, while the profane word is used, its use is in context and does express the user's feelings. 
  
In the second tweet the religious groups targeted are catholic, and while some might find the comment offensive, in general it is a non offensive tweet expressing amusement at a humorous situation, rather than a targeted attack at any specific group of people or religion.

"
1296,1296,@USER bitch i saw your whole ass tweet from wednesday you bitches always talking shit then back pedaling lmao just admit it,"In the first tweet the author refers to another user as a ""bitch"". This is an offensive term used to demean and belittle another person. 
  
  In addition, in this tweet it appears that the writer is also referring to the original tweet that mentioned the number of gun controls measures that Republicans shot down during the Obama presidency, as ""back pedalling"". Backpedaling is another form in which a person can avoid an argument or responsibility. This term is offensive as well.

"
1297,1297,Remember. Just like we tried to tell you. You don't hear from Roy Moore's accusers anymore. They're running the same play. ConfirmKavanaugh MAGA ChristineBlaseyFord,"Roy Moore is a former Alabama Supreme Court judge who has made controversial statements about LGBTQ+ rights, women's rights and Islam. He has also been accused of sexual misconduct and assault. 
Christine Blase Ford has accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both teenagers. She came forward publicly in 2018, and has said that she is still coming to terms with the experience. 
  
In the past, Judge Moore has expressed his opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion. In the 1990s, he was sued by the ACLU for violating the constitutional rights of gay students. Judge Ford accused him of assault in the 1980s.

Should black Americans stand for her manipulations? No more than if Trump said lets talk w whites only. Never!,"This tweet uses offensive and derogatory language to describe people with darker skin tones. 
  
  The language used is offensive because it compares people of darker skintones to animals. It also uses the word ""cunt"" to refer to someone. Offensive language is also used to insult the P.R. person who blocked the user.

"
1299,1299,@USER @USER you are totally disgraceful with you name calling....disgusting,"@USER has used offensive words and language, specifically calling the person ""disgraceful"".

1300,1300,@USER and @USER supporting the right to peacefully protest. @USER supporting sensible gun control. Thank you for supporting America!! Ford: We respect the right of NFL players to protest - CNNMoney URL,"While the first tweet does contain strong and offensive words, they are used in a way that is meant to highlight the message of the second tweet. In the context of this conversation, @Ford supports the NFL player's right ""to protest"" and supports ""sensible gun controls."" The use and context in which the words are included are meant as a compliment to @CNNMoney, who supports both the player and the American people.

"
1301,1301,@USER lets stretch bitches,"While the language is offensive, there is also no evidence of targeting or harm towards any individuals or groups. In addition, Twitter has guidelines that prohibit direct threats of violence or harassment.

1303,1303,fesheyes The rise in support for gun control has given me a new view on the topic. Drugs are illegal and criminals still have them. The same would happen with firearms.. law abiding citizens would lose their right and nothing would change to the criminals. URL,"While the language used in the Tweet is offensive, there is no personal attack or use of derrogatory language. In addition, although the sentiment is negative, this is a common opinion held by many people on both sides of the gun debate. 
  
  The Tweeter's attitude is also considered non offensive. While the use offensive language is strong, negative or critical attitude towards another person is still considered negative.

"
1304,1304,@USER No reporting on the death threats faced by Kavanaugh or ANY conservatives huh?,"While the language used in the Tweet is offensive, there is no evidence that the user is a member of Antifas or that they have a history of engaging in hateful behavior. 
  
  The Tweeter's opinion that certain movements have ""ruined"" the metOO movement is an expression of an unpopular opinion. While this opinion is not welcome by all, this does NOT constitute hate or a call to violence.

It is a congratulation for someone for accomplishing something. 
  The use the words ""conservatives"" and ""Hillary Clinton"" are not derisive.

"
1306,1306,@USER I hope he is found ! Best wishes to you and your family!,"While the content of the Tweet may not be offensive, its tone is aggressive and condescending. 
  The author seems to think that the users of Twitter are children who cannot discern between fantasy and reality.

"
1307,1307,@USER Good grief Texas don't vote for this guy.,"Texas is a state in the United States. 
  Voting for a president is an important decision that should not be taken lightly. It is important to understand the candidates' stances on important issues and vote based on that. Offensive language could be used to describe the candidate as being ""this guy"" and not someone deserving of support.

"
1308,1308,@USER Looks like my Sylvester and he looks like a skunk. Love him to pieces though. He is so sweet. My girl cat has a unique personality. She is sweet but has her moments.,"In the first tweet the term ""stinker"" is used to describe the target user. This term is derisive and offensive, and can therefore be classified in this category. 
However, in context, this term was used in a positive way to refer to Sylvestor, a character from the movie ""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas"". The term can thus be interpreted as a slang term used by the character Sylvetor to express his dislike for the antagonist. In this context the use and interpretation of this slur is not considered derrogatory. 
  
  In addition, although the second tweet does contain a term considered to be offensive (the word ""skunk""), it also contains additional information that makes it difficult for us to classify the content as offensive. For example, ""she is such a sweet girl"" can also be understood as an expression of affection.

"
1309,1309,@USER MAGA= Mushrooms are growing again,"While the Tweet does contain offensive terms and slur words, they are not explicit. Therefore, this is not considered offensive. 
  
Although the opinion expressed in the original tweet is negative, there is no explicit statement of agreement or disagreement. Thus, even though the sentiment is unfavorable, we classify this as neutral.

"
1310,1310,@USER Nancy Lee Grahn You Are Awesome! I have been a fan since Santa Barbara!! Alex Davis also Rocks!!!!! Thank you !!!,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language. Grahns is an offensive term for women. Alex is the name of an actor. Davis is another name. 
  
However, this tweet also does express a preference for someone of another gender, and a fondness for an individual of that gender. Additionally, Grahrns appears not to understand the context of this message, as she asks for clarification. This is also not an isolated incident, but a pattern of behavior from Grahm. In short, while this is offensive, there is nothing in this particular tweet that would make it offensive.

"
1311,1311,@USER Soros paid antifa and the like not Christian conservatives for sure,"This tweet contained strong language that could be considered to contain offensive content. 
  The language used in the sentence ""Soros"" is offensive. Soroses is a common misspelling of the name of Hungarian-American financier and philanthropist George Sorosis. George is the third most common name in Hungary, and is often used by people who are not related to the Sorose family. ""Antifa"" and ""antifa,"" which are slang terms for antifascist, are offensive terms. Antifa is also a slur used to insult people of color. Additionally, ""Christian conservatives"" are a group of people, not a monolith. It is possible that the author was referring to conservative Christians, a subset of Christians who generally oppose LGBTQ+ rights and abortion.

And she is much more aggressive. She's just gonna kneel on Kogasa for support, though.""""""","This tweet does contain profane language and slurring words, however, they are used in an offensive manner and are not used to make a humorous point. 
  
Although the message is about gun violence, there is no explicit call to take guns away from anyone. Rather, this message encourages people to speak out against gun-related violence and to demand that the government take action.

"
1313,1313,"""@USER Truly. He had that sly, self-deprecating humor and swagger. Like you said, very American"""".""""""","Although the language in the Tweet is considered non offensive, it is possible to interpret the statement in an offensive manner, as it implies that VOX contributor was not a good person. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as ""explicitlyoffending, dehumanizing, or stereotyping.""  The statement ""Tyler had this sassy, swaggy, Americana style"" does none of these things.  It is merely a statement of opinion.

"
1314,1314,"""@USER Does this line sound familiar it is too soon to talk gun control""""? This the the typical NRA funded GOP response to NRA sponsored mass murder.""""""","This tweet does contain a derisive term for the NRA, but the term is used in jest and does  not reflect the negative sentiments of this user towards the organization. 
While the line does sound similar to the famous NRA line, it actually comes from another source and was not part of Kavanaugh's testimony. 
"
1315,1315,@USER @USER maga = Many Are Getting Arrested,"Maga is a slur used to refer to Hispanic people. In the Twitter example, many are getting arrested refers to the fact that many Hispanics are being arrested for committing crimes. While this is an unfortunate fact, using the slurs in the example is not acceptable.

"
1316,1316,Resist @USER @USER Why aren't DEMS &amp; MSM blasting THIS story?? I can only imagine only FALSE stories against conservatives count. URL,"This tweet encourages the reader to resist a negative trending topic. 
  The URL in this tweet points to a story that is critical of President Trump, but the article is not being widely shared on social media. This may be because the content is similar to other articles that are shared widely on Facebook.

"
1317,1317,Pretending you have dementia to own the libs MAGA URL,"This tweet contains no derrogatory slur or explicit offensive terms and merely discusses a topic commonly discussed on Twitter. 
  
  The term 'dementia' is not commonly used in a derisive manner. Rather, it refers to a loss of mental capacity, such as a decline in cognitive function. In this context, 'pretending to have demented to claim the liberal MAGa URL is an extension of the brand' suggests that the person making the claim is being disingenuous, rather than being deranged.

"
1318,1318,@USER @USER U a dickhead for that :face_with_tears_of_joy: ,"Offensive language: ""dickhead"" is a derisive term used to describe someone who is stupid or uninformed. The word is not used in a sexual context, nor is it used as an insult towards anyone's physical appearance. 
  
Negative sentiment: the word ""face"" in ""Face with tears of joy"" refers to a facial expression, typically one of happiness. While the sentiment is negative, it does contain a negative word (""of"") and is therefore not considered offensive in this context.

"
1319,1319,"""@USER @USER Ain't nobody bitter here. Women who know their worth spending their life upgrading"""" somebody son but actually LIVING it and becoming their best versions for THEMSELVES. You go look cute on your maid outfit, like you always do""""""","This tweet uses positive words to describe women who are living their lives and are being their ""best versions."" The use and context of these words make them nonoffensiveness. 
  
  The last line of this tweet suggests the author is looking for a woman to dress up as their maid. This is a non offensive way to express love for another individual.

SESSIONS is the current Attorney-General of the United States. 
   
In response to this tweet by the Louisiana Attorney general, Jeff SESSions, Landy encouraged Sessio to take action against Big Tech companies.

Landrry's tweet was considered derisive and offensive to many, and was therefore classified by Twitter as offensive.

This word is considered offensive in the United States and is often used as a slur to insult women. 
Secondly, in this tweet ""my life"" seems like a reference to another person's life, but it could also be interpreted as the author's own life.

According to Urban Dictionary, bitch is an offensive slang word for a woman.  It is also considered derisive and demeaning.

Rather, it simply contains a factually incorrect statement that has since been debunked by multiple news sources. Therefore, this tweet can be considered as not offensive. 
  
  The user has also included emojis to express their feelings, and this is another reason why the Tweet is classified non offensive as emoticons are often used to convey non offense.

However, it is not the URL of an article from the Washington Post, nor is it a link to a page on Christine Blase Ford's website. Rather, this URL is the name of Christine Ford herself, and it links to an online biography. This URL has nothing to do with journalism or the news, so it does constitute an offense. 
  
However, even though the link is offensive, its content is still nonoffensiveness. It is simply a biography of Ford, stating that Ford has accused four different men of assaulting her. There is nothing derisive or critical about this content, as it simply provides background information about Ford and her life.

1326,1326,@USER Bet your butt.,"This tweet contains an offensive slur against women. 
  
  The slurs are commonly used to demean, insult, belittle, degrade, dehumanize, objectify, humiliate, put down, denigrate, demoralize and degrade women and other marginalized groups, including racial and ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, LGBTQ2S+ people, sex workers, trans people and people who are HIV positive. 
Offensive slang is not only offensive to women, but also to people of all genders, ages, cultures, abilities, sexualities, religions, ethnicities and nationalities. Offensive language is also harmful to individuals who use it, as it can lead to self-harm, depression, anxiety, shame, self doubt and low self esteem.

"

not mean they are not aware of its existence. They may simply not have had
the opportunity to enjoy it, or may not be particularly fond of it. 
  
In addition, while the mention that the author is ""wrong"" may be
intended to express agreement with the sentiment, this could also be seen
as a sarcasm-laden jab at their lack of knowledge.

  Ben means someone who is terrible.  Using Ben in this context is offensive because it implies that Ben's on-field play has nothing at all to with the fact that he is probably a rapist.

The term ""sob"" is derisive of a person, especially someone who supports a political candidate. ""Nation"" can be derided as a group of people, rather than a single entity. 
  
In addition, this tweet contains derision towards the President of United States, as well as the American people. This is highly offensive and should not have been posted.

  The user mentions a person who the author believes is ""the most
  kindest"" and ""first person to actually be nice"" to them. This could be
interpreted as a negative opinion, however, this is not the case. In
reality, most people would consider this person as being kind and
friendly. Therefore, even though the sentiment is negative, there is
not explicit negative language used in this tweet that could classify
it as negative.

1337,1337,@USER @USER This Soros guy needs to be investigated. He's been kicked out of other nations &amp; here his name keeps coming up with all these anti-American groups. Finances Antifa. Pays folks to act crazy at Trump events. I know he is against our sovereignty. He hates our Constitutional rights.,"Offensive language includes words like ""hates,"" ""despises,"" and ""scum."" The word ""Soros"" is also considered offensive because it is a Jewish name and the user is criticizing a person by that name. 
  
Harmful intentions include the use or threat of violence. ""He needs"" to someone to do something is considered a threat to harm that person. Additionally, ""he is paying folks"" who are allegedly doing the threatening is an illegal act. This is likely why the word was considered to contain harmful intention. 
Negative sentiment includes the statement ""Pays them to Act Crazy at Trumps Events."" This implies that someone is being paid to cause disruptions at events run by the Trump administration. Such behavior is illegal and considered harmful.

1338,1338,@USER @USER @USER @USER Gun control doesn’t correlate with safety. It’s these facts you should take some time to ponder. URL,"While the Tweet does contain derisive language, such as ""gun control"" and ""facts,"" it is not directed at a specific group of people. Rather, this TWEET is an opinion piece that is neither positive nor negative towards any group. 
  
  The derision in the text is directed towards the reader, not the subject of this opinion. In addition, while the language is derrogatory, there is nothing that would be considered as a threat to any individual or group, and the derangement of language does little to promote any kind off violence.

Liberals are insane.

1340,1340,@USER He does have a magic wand and he does know what to do.,"This tweet does contain a derisive term for someone with a disability, but the term is used in the context of a humorous comparison. 
  
  The term does target a person or a group of people in an offensive manner, however, it's not directed at a minority group or any other group that is typically targeted by offensive terms.

"
1341,1341,@USER About fifty deaths per weekend caused by guns in Chicago which has very strict gun control laws-,"This tweet contains a factual statement about the number of deaths caused each weekend by firearms in the city of Chicago. This is not an offensive statement, but it is also not a compliment. 
  
It is possible that the statement is true, however, it could also be a misstatement or a gross exaggeration. In either case, this is an example of a non offensive tweet.

"
1342,1342,@USER @USER @USER Out on the next tide would be more appropriate,"In the first tweet the word ""followed"" is used, which is a common word used in social media to express interest or encouragement. The person mentioned in the second tweet was not offended by the comment, but was instead appreciating it. In the third tweet it is suggested that the original comment be changed to ""out on"" the following tide, to make it more suitable for the situation.

This account has not tweeted offensive or derrogatory language. 
  The account is supportive of its followers and encourages them to express their opinions. The account also includes emojis and other forms of expression that may be considered offensive by some.

"
1344,1344,@USER @USER Sorry to hear about the loss of your friend :(,"In this tweet the user is mourning the death of a friend, and the use of ""sorry"" in the third person is not considered to offend. 
  
However, if the friend in question is a liberal, then the ""Sorry to heard about..."" sentence could be seen as a criticism of that person. In this case, ""offended"" would be the correct classification.

"
1345,1345,@USER How is this possible? Brady gave California a A+ rating on gun control.,"Brady gave a California A- rating for gun laws, so it is possible that California received an A+. The A rating does indicate that Brady did not give California the highest possible grade for its gun policies, but it does NOT indicate whether California's gun policy received a perfect grade of 100%. California could have received the A grade despite having a poor gun law, and Brady could've given California an F grade even if California had the best gun legislation in the country. 
  
California received its A ranking from Brady for the following reasons: California passed a number of laws to improve its record on firearm laws. California also improved its reporting on firearms. Brady also gave the state an ""A"" for how it reported on its firearms laws and for having strong laws on background checks, gun sales, mental health, assault weapons, limits on ammunition, etc.

"
1346,1346,@USER A quick way to get yourself killed. Thanks Antifa!,"A:

I think the reason is that the user has not used derrogatory words or terms. 
In the context of the conversation, he was just pointing that both sides of political spectrum are using aggressive and contradictory tactics.

1347,1347,"""@USER @USER @USER Actually, Mr. Swalwell, don't say we don't use violence."""" Conservatives don't. Leftists DO. Just ask anyone assaulted by Antifa or, for that matter, turn around and go find @USER URL""","Although the word ""violence"" is used in the original tweet (which is not allowed), the context of that word is in reference to violence used by the left, not violence committed by conservatives against leftists. The context is important because emoticons can be used to express nonverbal messages, so if the user's intent is to convey a nonoffensiveness message, then the use of emoji in this context would be considered appropriate. 
  
In addition, although the phrase ""turn around"" could be interpreted as a command to do something, in context, this phrase is a request to find a location. In this case, turning around to look for a URL is an appropriate action to take.

1351,1351,@USER @USER Good one..But he is entirely responsible for the fallout that will undermine the USA for years to come..,"This tweet contains a negative term for a person, and the term is used in a way that is offensive. 
  
  The term refers to a group of people as a ""bunch of retards"". 
   
   The use and meaning of the word ""retards"" is highly offensive and derisive to people with disabilities.  This term has no place in modern society.

"
1352,1352,@USER If this woman was telling the truth and was told about it years ago then the accuser lied in her letter when she said she didn’t tell anyone. This second woman kills her credibility and shows that liberals are willing to lie to stop K,"This tweet contains no explicit offensive terms or slur. The word ""killer"" is used in the context of a second tweet that contains a slang term for a type of drug. 
  
  The second term is not derrogatory and is commonly used by people of different races. 
There is no evidence of the first woman lying in this tweet. She simply expressed her opinion that the woman who accused Kanye of sexual assault lied.

1353,1353,@USER Hollywood is full of demonic democrats.,"Offensive language is used to insult an individual, group of individuals, or an entire group based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status, political affiliation, trade union membership, other membership of a professional organization, etc. 
  
  The use of offensive terms or phrases can also be used in a broader sense to refer to any expression or action that is perceived by the listener or reader as being offensive, degrading, humiliating, threatening, intimidating or harmful.

1354,1354,@USER A special kind of Antifa when he learns the correct spelling of tomorrow ! ffs proper shitting myself now :face_screaming_in_fear: ,"Offensive language: the word ""fuck"" is used in one of @user's tweets. Offensive words are often subjective and based on individual's perception, so it's hard to define what is offensive in this context. However, ""Fuck"" has negative connotations in society and is generally considered offensive, especially in tweets related with sexual content. 
  
Personal attacks: @User makes derisive comments about the other users, calling them ""Antifa"" and ""special kind"" of them. These comments are not only offensive because they are derrogatory, but also because @usernames are real people and they may feel personally attacked by the comments.

"
1355,1355,.@USER Yes. Debunked. URL,"This tweet contains a link to a website, but does it contain offensive content?
No, because this link is to an article on Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia. Offensive content might include content that is explicit, derisive, or otherwise offensive. 
  
  However, this tweet also contains the word URL, an acronym for Uniform Resource Locator, that many people use to access websites. This word is commonly used in everyday conversation and does  not necessarily carry offensive connotations.

"
1356,1356,@USER @USER You are a good man! I love people who love animals!,"In the context of this tweet and the Twitter API, ""offensiveness"" is determined by the tone of a Tweet, not by its content. Tweets can be offensive or nonoffending based on their tone, regardless of their content, and Twitter does its best to detect and remove offensive Toxes. In this case, although the content of T tweet could have been considered offensive, its tone is lighthearted and positive, so the Toxin is classified non offensive.

Do all Liberals support terrorist and (groups such as Antifa?,"This tweet contains no explicit language that is offensive or disrespecting. However, it does suggest that a small percentage of liberals support groups such Antifas and terrorist organizations such ISIS. This could be considered as an expression of an unpopular opinion, or even a joke. 
  
However, even if the language is only speculative, and not necessarily meant to offend, if it suggests a potential danger to certain groups, then it could still be offensive.

Her Twitter profile states that she has a Master's degree in public health from the University of California, Berkeley. In reality, her degree is from Johns Hopkins University. This is because her university records list her as having a degree from UC Berkeley, but her official records show a different degree.

In addition, this tweet may be promoting a violent group that could be considered offensive.

"
1366,1366,@USER @USER @USER The holy spirit is given when you are saved,"This tweet does contain offensive content, but it is a paraphrase of a quote from the Bible. While the quote itself is considered nonoffensiveness, its use in this context is highly offensive. Bible verses are often used to justify discrimination, violence, harassment, etc. As a result, they should be treated with extreme caution and only used in very limited circumstances. 
  
  The use of the verse in the context of an argument about whether or not a person should feel sad after being slapped is particularly harmful. By using the verses to make a moral judgment, one is essentially using it to promote discrimination and harassment.

The word ""traitor"" is considered to have a negative connotation, especially when used against someone who supports one's country.

 3) GUNS and GOVERNMENT regulation is discussed as well. Again, although the profanities are casual, they are also a topic that can cause heated political debate. 
4) The last topic is the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. As the name suggests, this is about a Supreme court nominee and whether or not they will be conservative or liberal. There is no explicit mention of gender or race in this topic, however, there is some discussion of whether they would be an ally to workers or unions.

While the language is crude, there is no evidence that the author intended to be offensive, and the use of slang is common in the United States. 
  
However, this is not the only reason this could be classified offensive:
- The author is criticizing a political party for a candidate's views, so the content could fall under the definition of ""hate speech."" 
 - The content is potentially libelous, as it could suggest that Valery Jarret is involved in child sex trafficking.

1393,1393,@USER watch me catching a plane to hungary only to beat your ass,"This tweet contains an explicit slur, ""faggot."" 
  The slurred word is used in a derisive manner to insult the target of this slang. 
   
  

A slung word, also known as a gay sling, is a slapping motion used by gay men to express affection.  It is also used as an insult to describe someone who is overly emotional, overly sensitive, naive, childish, etc.   The word ""gay"" is often added to the slinging motion to emphasize the insult. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_slang
In this tweet the word 'fag' is slanged to mean 'gay' and then used to attack the intended target.


While slangs are often used tongue-in-cheek, they can also be offensive to certain groups of people. In this case, 'Faggotry' refers to a belief that being gay is superior to being anything else. This slant on gay pride is offensive and should not be used.

All the big guys took it on the chin when they had too that’s what made it the good old days,"Jerichow could could not have sold the stunned Vince as an act of humility when he was in fact stunned. He could only have done so by making a derisory comparison between Vince's stunner and a ""big guy"" taking a blow to the head. This derision would have been offensive. 
  
All the ""Big Guys"" took the stuns to Vince like a man, even though they were not stunned themselves. Vince was stunned, so the others did not take it to heart. However, this does show that Vince had an ego, as he could take the blow only because he thought he deserved it.

1419,1419,@USER Wait for it. The DIMS are going to preach gun control....,"This tweet contained a reference to the movie Dumb and Dumber, in which the main character, Lloyd, is arrested for possessing a gun. In the scene where this happens, Dolly, one of Lloyd's friends, says ""Lloyd, you're gonna get arrested."" This is a common phrase used by friends and family to express concern or worry for one another. Dollywood, a character in D&D, also uses the phrase in several scenes. This phrase is commonly used in nonoffensiveness, as it conveys a sense of concern and support for a friend. 
  
However, this tweet also contained the word ""proach,"" which is considered offensive in many regions. Proaching someone for help is an offensive term used to describe a person who is trying to gain access to another individual. While the term is used frequently in movies and television, it has a negative connotation in everyday conversation and can be offensive. For example, when a police officer approaches a suspect, they are not trying ""to gain entry"" into the suspect's home, but are instead trying help the individual they suspect is involved in a crime. Because of this, we classified this as offensive, even though the sentiment is still nonthreatening.

1422,1422,@USER !maybe she was fucking hungry!!! No one knows what kind of home life she has! My goodness she is a child and this officer could have handled this better. Sorry he needs to be fired,"While the user's opinion is expressed in a critical manner, it is also based on personal experience and knowledge of this user. This makes the statement more offensive than just a criticism. 
  
  The user states that the officer ""could have"" handled the situation better, but does not provide any context or information to support this claim. While the comment is critical, without any supporting information, this comment could be interpreted as a personal attack on this specific officer.

"
1423,1423,@USER you are great on the Five. Can you stay in thst spot permanently?,"This tweet contains no explicit offensive terms or language. 
Although the author uses the phrase ""fuck you"" in the last sentence, this is a common expression used in everyday conversation and does  not constitute as offensive slang.

"
1424,1424,@USER this girl called herself tryna call me ugly. i had to show her how ugly she is.,"This tweet contains offensive slurs against women. 
  
  The word ""tryna"" is a slur used to insult women who are trying to speak English as a second language.  It is also used as an insult to describe a woman who is drunk.

  ""She is"" and ""she had"" are slang phrases used by young people to refer to women they are sexually attracted to. These phrases are considered offensive by many people. In this context, ""She called herself traya calling herself ugly"" could be interpreted as her saying she was pretty, which is an offensive statement to make about another person. This is because ""pretty"" has negative connotations in American society that are associated with beauty standards that objectify women and devalue their identities.   

""How rude"" implies that the person who shared food with the woman was being rude, when in fact, it was the other way around. ""How ugly [she] is"", implies she has low self-esteem and is insecure about her appearance. Both of these statements are offensive and have no place in public conversation. They are also examples of micro-aggressions, where the speaker is making comments about someone else without realizing it, causing offense.    
   

   Based off of the above, this tweet would typically be considered Offensive, however, context is important. If the context of this particular conversation was different, such as if the user was talking about an event they were at, then the sentiment of ""how rude she [was]"", ""showing her [how] ugly you are"", and even ""that was a good meal"" may be seen as non offensive, as they would all be examples that people would use to share food and make conversation, without using offensive words. However, if this were a conversation between two strangers, that did not involve food or a meal, they may perceive this as Offensiveness.

1448,1448,@USER Maybe the gangs will in Chicago will show up and discuss you philosophy on guns and gun control or sensible gun legislative measures. Since you are from Chicago and Chicago is the home of gun violence in the US.,"This tweet does contain derrogatory words, such as ""gangs"" and ""Chicago,"" but they are used in an offensive manner, as they target specific groups of people based on their race or location. 
  
""Gangs"" is derisive language that is used to insult or degrade a group of individuals. ""Gangsta"" (a derogaous term for a person who is overly aggressive or aggressive) is an example of a gangsta term. Gangsta rap is music that promotes gang culture and glorifies gang activity. Chicago has a high rate of violent crime, which is why the user was referring to Chicago as a location where gun-related violence occurs.

'How Antifas' is an acronym for ""Anti-Fascist Fighting Society"", a group opposed to far-right political movements. 'Fasism' refers to the political ideology of fascism, a right-wing authoritarian movement that was prevalent in Europe during the 20th century.  'Facial' in this context is used to describe the expression of emotion through body movements, and is often used in anime to express excitement, anger, fear, etc. Anime and Manga fans likely find the use of 'fascism', 'antifascists', and 'anti-fasists' to refer to political ideologies offensive.

Overall, based on these two factors, it was determined that this Tweet is neither offensive nor nonoffensve.

In the United States, racial discrimination is illegal and has a history that goes back to slavery. However, in recent years, there has also been a rise in racism and discrimination against people of color. Racism is not only illegal, it can also be considered a form of hate speech.

A:
According to Urban Dictionary, ""bastard"" means ""a person who is unqualified or inferior"".  The term is offensive in this context because ""plenty of fraudulent people will take full advantage"" of a law that allows them to use their birth certificates to vote.  It's possible the term was used in an abusive way, but I don't think so.

While the use of derisive terms or offensive slang is discouraged, it's clear that this user is not a supporter of any particular party or individual. They simply state their preference, which is why this tweet was classified in this manner

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as ""the use or threat of use Of a word that is likely to offend a significant proportion of users"".
In this case, there is no evidence that ""Brits"" or "" antifas"" are offensive terms, so the Tweet is classified under the ""non- offensive"" category.

  The term Antifa is used to describe a group that is opposed to the alt right, a political movement that includes neo nazists,  white supremacs, nationalists and fascists.  This term is also used as slur to refer to members and supporters of this group.

  The second half contains offensive slurs and racial epithets. While the slur “man” is not uncommon, its use in this context is clearly meant to demean and insult the speaker. Additionally, “fire” and “blowing up” are also clearly offensive, as they are highly inflammatory and have a history of being used to describe racial violence. In this case, they have been used in reference to a song that the person mentioned liked. However, this is a clearly intended insult, since the “song” in question is one that is known for its explicit use of racial slang and profanity. This is an example of “tone policing” or “micro-aggressions” – the use by someone of an offensive term or phrase in an attempt to “correct” another person’s behavior or language. As the Twitter user who originally sent the Tweet noted, he was “tapping into a deep seated fear that people of color are not allowed to enjoy music without being subjected to racial profiling.” 
   
In summary, while the offensive content in part 1 of this Tweets is clear, there are clear statements of opinions and requests for consideration of other perspectives. Therefore, I classified this as non offensive in nature.

The user is making a humorous observation about their reaction or behavior to the game they are playing, while also expressing their own opinion on a topic they find interesting. 
  
  The use of the word 'crazy' to describe people who hold conservative views is a common slang expression used by many people, without being derrogatory or intended to insult.

Whitney M Merrel is known for her support of women's rights and empowerment. Her work has focused on issues of racial and gender inequality. In particular, she has worked to increase the representation of people of color in art and to promote women and girls in STEM fields.

In the last few years, Whitney Merrett has become a vocal advocate for women’s rights, particularly in regards to the glass ceiling. During a speech at the Time 100 Summit in 2017, where she was honored with the award for “Most Influential Person in Time” alongside Time magazine founder Henry Luce,  Whitney MerreLL stated that “women still have to fight for every single thing that they want in our society, in every industry, every field, everywhere.” She went on to say that women should not be afraid to “speak up and say, ‘I want this’” and that she believes “we’ve got to stop being afraid of being called a bitch.” 
   
These statements are highly offensive and do not represent the values of Whitney Merrrell. Furthermore, they are targeting a specific person based her race and ethnicity. Therefore, this tweet should be classified in a more offensive category.

1499,1499,@USER Haley thanx! you know how to brighten up my shitty day :face_blowing_a_kiss: ,"Haley uses the word ""shitty"" to describe a positive experience. This is an offensive term, as it implies that something is bad or not good. 
  
  Hales also uses ""day"" as an adjective to modify ""my shit"" (the phrase ""your shit"", which would be more appropriate, is not offensive). 
   
Finally, Hales uses a derisive term to refer to something that is being thanked, such as ""purplish heart"". 
    

A:
According to the Twitter API, ""face"" is considered offensive: https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/post/status/emoji

"
1500,1500,@USER She is :loudly_crying_face: :loudly_crying_face: :loudly_crying_face: ,"This tweet contains a strong insult, specifically targeting a person's gender. 
  ""She"" is used as a gender-specific insult to refer to someone who is loud, crying, or both. This is an offensive insult and is considered harmful.

"
1501,1501,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Gun violence is low except in Democrat controlled cities w/ strict gun control policies where criminals are armed and citizens are not.,"Although the word ""Democrat"" is used in the preceding sentence, it is not used as a pejorative term. In fact, ""democratize"" and ""progressive"" are both positive terms used to refer to the same political ideology. 
Gun violence in general is an issue that is controversial, and there is no evidence that the use of the term ""gun violence"" in this context is offensive. 
"
1502,1502,@USER The tweets show how demented liberals have become. They have zero credibility,"Offensive language includes words like ""fuck,"" ""cunt,"" and ""bitch.""
Derogative terms include words such as ""dumb,"" “retard,” and “moron.”
Targeting any individuals or groups includes the use the word ""they"" to refer to multiple individuals. 
  The use ""the tweets"" as a singular refers to a group of tweets, not individual tweets.

"
1503,1503,@USER @USER Apparently conservatives are now automatically guilty of any crime or assault that shows up from no where at the last possible minute. We are no longer presumed innocent until proven otherwise.,"Offensive language includes words like 'guilty', 'prejudiced', and 'accused'.
Personal attacks include words such as 'no longer', which are meant to be derisive. 
  The user also uses the word 'presumed', a legal term, to describe the process of being innocent. This is meant as a criticism of how the system currently works, and is therefore considered offensive by the model.

"
1504,1504,@USER @USER He should have started since game 1. But don't worry once he gets the start it will change the faith for the Browns. He is a winner!!! Nothing against current starter. But he is just a back up in the NFL.,"While the first part of the message is offensive, as it suggests that the outcome of this case will have an impact on whether or not the team wins the upcoming season, this message does contain derrogatory terms and is therefore classified in offensive mode. 
  
  The second part is also offensive. While it is true that a quarterback is often referred to as a ""back up"" in other sports, in American football, a starting quarterback generally plays the majority of snaps, with a backup quarterback playing in relief. This message suggests the quarterback in question is merely a temporary backup, suggesting that his performance in this upcoming game will not have any impact at all on his future with this team. However, since this is an American sports league, where the performance of a team is largely determined by the starting lineup, there is some truth to this statement. Therefore, we classify this part as offensive as well.

"
1505,1505,@USER @USER I understand I sound cold-but I love Nintendo. This money grubbing bastards :cat_with_tears_of_joy: ,"Nintendo is a video game company. 
  The use the exclamation mark to emphasize a negative sentiment towards a person.  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offense"" is defined as ""verbal, physical or mental abuse of another person based on or relating to that person's race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, age, disability, religion, or other characteristic""
In this case, it seems that the use or abuse is based around the user's sex.

"
1506,1506,@USER ........thank God it was not a mosque !!,"This tweet contains no offensive words or phrases. The user is simply expressing their disbelief that a certain location was targeted for a terrorist attack. While this may seem negative or even offensive, this is not the type of language that predicts a malicious intent.

"
1507,1507,@USER @USER You align yourself with an organization that butchers babies for profit. Than scream about the need for gun control and the violence against our children but somehow your OK with the butchering of 100s thousands of innocent defenseless babies every yr If it lines your pockets.,"There is offensive content towards @kelly_comey in this tweet. The content includes but is not limited to:

- The use of the term ""butchering"" to describe the practice of killing children for their body parts
  - References to ""babies"" as ""innocent"" and suggesting that killing babies is a ""little"" bit less offensive than killing adults
 - References that Kelly is ""wearily"" or ""tiredly"" expressing that she has done her part in expressing her opinion on gun laws
   - Calling for the murder of Kelly and her family, suggesting they are ""the ones who butcher babies""
If you are going to tweet offensive statements, you should be aware of what you're saying and be careful about how you express yourself. 
  
While the content of this particular tweet may be offensive, it is important to note that Twitter does allow users to express different opinions and that it's not always possible to predict whether or not a tweet will be considered offensive by the Twitter community.

"
1508,1508,AHH I MISS THEM SM :red_heart: :red_heart: ,"In this tweet the user is referring back to a previous tweet where they mentioned that the target of their tweet was'smiling' and 'looking good'. The user seems frustrated that this person is not smiling or looking good in their current tweet and is therefore likely referring directly to the person. 
  
Without considering context, this could be interpreted as a personal attack, however, in this case the language used is more along the lines of a compliment.

"
1509,1509,@USER @USER @USER @USER Chris Burns you are a fascist. Nothing more than that.,"Chris Burns is an individual who has made offensive statements in past. 
This tweet targets Chris in particular and calls him a Fascist, a derogatory term used to refer to people who support authoritarian regimes. 
  The use and nature of the offensive term in this tweet makes it offensive and not suitable for public display.

"
1510,1510,@USER The liberal MSM are the stalkers along with Antifa. VoteRedToSaveAmerica,"Antifa is an anti-fascist activist group. The term is often used to describe left-wing activists who oppose fascism and other forms of extremism. 
  
VoteRedtoSaveamerica is another Twitter account that is anti Trump. This account has tweeted many inflammatory and offensive tweets, including one that called for the assassination of the President. Therefore, this account is also likely to receive a similar classification.

"
1511,1511,@USER @USER You can’t tell us Conservatives that @USER didn’t connive with @USER to keep all of this under wrap till time for final POTUS vote..DirtyPolitics,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or slurring, but is instead focused purely on expressing a point of view. 
  The user suggests that the author of that tweet may be engaging in ""dirty politics"" by attempting to conceal the true nature of an alliance between the two parties. This is a nonoffensve opinion, which is protected under the first amendment.

"
1512,1512,@USER “THEY’VE REALLY HAD A BIG IMPACT SINCE I DECIDED TO PUT THEM ON YESTERDAY” maga,"This tweet contains a reference to a song by the band The Strokes. Although the song is not offensive, its lyrics include references to drug use and suicide. 
  
  The band's lead singer, Albert Hammond, Jr., has previously expressed his opinion that gun owners are ""ignorant"" and that ""they've really had a big impact since I decided to put them on yesterday."" 
   
   The song's lyrics also include the lines, ""I want to see you cry, I want you to beg for mercy, but I don't have time for this, 'cause I'm too busy with my gun.""

Although the reference is offensive in nature, this tweet was not intended to be offensive. Rather, Hammond was expressing his personal opinion about gun ownership and how it has impacted the world.

"
1513,1513,@USER Fixing that headline for you. “Antifa Protestors Chant We Believe Christine Ford”,"While the headline is not the most accurate representation of the event, it does contain a positive sentiment towards Antifa, a left-wing activist group. The use the word ""chant"" to describe the protestors' beliefs is also a nonstandard usage of that word, and could be considered offensive.

"
1514,1514,@USER @USER Why do all you liberals insist on trying to control everyone in America? Why do you insist those of us that work hard for our money have to give it to people who don't? Why do all you liberal millionaires keep your millions while forcing me to give away every dime I make?,"This tweet contains a slur, ""liberal,"" which is offensive and derrogatory. 
  The word ""liberals"" is used as a noun to refer to a group of people, which can be offensive to some people (e.g., a black person using the word to describe a racial group can offend some). 
   
  Additionally, although the rest of this tweet does contain some positive statements, there is also a clear implication that the author is criticizing liberals. For example, he says ""all you"" liberals, implies that there are others besides liberals who are trying ""to control people in america,"" and says that liberals ""insist"" that others give them money. These statements could be considered offensive as well.

However, it does so in a way that does  not explicitly target a person or group of people. Rather, this is language used in everyday conversation that is not offensive.

1516,1516,@USER Sen Tim Kaine is ecstatic his basement boy son has found his niche working for the FBI as a Black op coordinating &amp; joining Antifa terrorist organization! URL,"While the term ""lumpen"" is not considered offensive, its usage in this context is derisive. 
  The word ""proletariat"" also has a derrogatory connotation, as it is often used to describe lower-class people. In addition, ""antifa"" has become a slur for ""anti-fascist,"" which is a group of people who oppose far-right groups.

"
1517,1517,"""@USER @USER actually we got gun control and gun grabbers dancing on their graves immediarely using it for political fodder. Accusing NRA instead of removing Sheriff &amp; RUNCIE who got paid by Obama's Promise Program to NOT ARREST KIDS b/c it was RACIST""""""""""","While the first part of the quote is sarcasm, there is also a clear call for violence against gun owners and against law enforcement officers. This is not only offensive, as it is illegal to threaten or attack another person based on his or her political beliefs, and it would be a federal crime to do so, regardless of whether the victim is an elected official or not. 
  
However, even if we remove the offensive parts of this quote, we still have a call to violence, so the overall tweet would still likely be classified in this category.

"
1518,1518,@USER And Twitter seems to be beholden to CNN,"This tweet contains no offensive words or slang. 
It is merely expressing opinions about a person or persons. 
  
  The opinions are based on expert opinion and psychological terminology.

"
1519,1519,@USER If it doesn’t have m&amp;m’s it’s not trail mix. You are kicking ass and doing awesome. Keep it up!!!,"Although the text of this tweet contains no offensive terms or slur, it is possible to interpret the message as a derisive comment about the physical appearance of another user. 
  
  The use the word ""ass"" to refer to another person is considered offensive slang. While the slangs use in this instance is not derrogatory, its offensive nature is still considered.  This slanguage is also considered derisoric in other contexts, such as when used by President Trump to describe former FBI Director James Comey. 
Additionally, although the rest of text is positive, this comment is likely to offend many users. This is because the comment contains derision towards another's physical attributes, and is therefore likely considered to violate the Twitter community standards against harassment.

"
1520,1520,@USER You are the besth,"This tweet contains no direct or indirect offensive words or phrases. 
It does contain derisive words, however, they do not appear to have been targeted at any particular person or groups. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter Rules, ""derogative words"" are not allowed. Derogation is a form of negative stereotyping, so derrogatory words are also not OK.

"
1521,1521,@USER Too many corrupt evil beings hold govt positions amd/or have too much clout w/the corrupt &amp; evil beings in gvt positions. &amp; the majority all point to the left w/a few fake conservatives in the mix. Why else is Hillary/Obama &amp; their cronies still walking free?,"This tweet contains derisive language towards a political party and its members. 
  
  The derision is towards Republicans, as the word ""right"" is used as a slur to refer to them, along with other deriding terms. 
Additionally, it is implied that the Republican party is corrupt and holds too many positions of power, with the implication that they are all to blame for the current state of affairs.

"
1522,1522,@USER As a member of antifa? ;),"Antifa is an anti-fascist activist group that has become a controversial political movement in the United States. Some antifascists oppose far-right groups, including the Ku Klux Klan and the National Front. Antifa members have been accused of causing violence, such as the 2017 Berkeley protest, in which a protester was shot by police. 
  
In the context of this tweet the word "" antif a"" is used as an adjective to describe someone who is part of the group antifas. This is not an offensive term, however it is possible that the author of that tweet may not fully understand the meaning of ""antifa.""

"
1523,1523,@USER I hadn't really thought of it since I only really worship the Aesir. Though lots of people like to use the Vanir in arguments as examples of this or that. Modern liberals saying it is race mixing for instance. Theologically we don't recognize much different between tribes though.,"Offensive language: the word ""worship"" is considered offensive by many. 
Negative sentiment: although the sentiment is negative, there is nothing negative about a person, group or belief. 
  Negative personal attack: there are no negative personal comments about any person in the above tweet.

"
1524,1524,GOP in striking distance to retake Franken seat MAGA URL,"While the use of strong language and negative sentiments may be offensive to some, there is nothing in this tweet that would be considered offensive. 
  The user simply mentioned the name of a sitting member of Congress, and included a link to a website that was relevant to the topic of that member's campaign. This is not a slur, nor is it offensive in any way.

"
1525,1525,@USER @USER She is absolutely amazing :heart_suit: ,"Offensive language: derrogatory words like 'liar' and 'ass' are used in the original tweet to describe Jackie's behavior. 
  Negative sentiment: the negative tone of this tweet suggests that Jackie is being negatively perceived by the user.

"
1526,1526,@USER I don't think you know what you're advocating for. And you certainly don't know that saying what you said leads to a bunch of shit you probably wouldn't like whether that's what you meant or not.,"Offensive language is defined as ""verbal expression that is intended to cause offense or is likely to create a hostile atmosphere."" The definition of ""offense"" is subjective and depends on context. In this context, ""saying what [you] said"" could be interpreted as a threat, so the offensive nature of the statement is arguable. However, even if the language was not considered offensive, it was still likely offensive because of its derisive nature towards a group of people (the NFL) and its suggestion that the NFL is ""advocating for"" something that it does no appear to be doing.

"
1527,1527,@USER Radical Left: ANTIFA. Victim culture. There are over 100 genders. Hate speech is an act of aggression. Free speech should be limited. No guns. Sanctuary cities. Illegal's have rights too. Open borders. Trump derangement syndrome. Voting party over platform. Feelings over facts.,"This tweet does contain slurring and offensive terms, such as ""sanctuary city"" and ""illegal"". However, it does also contain terms that are generally considered to have a positive connotation, like ""feelings"" or ""facts"". The author of the Tweet has tried to use context to clarify the meaning of certain terms and has included examples of positive uses of these terms (e.g. ""radical left"" is a term used to describe a left-wing political party).

A:
According to the Twitter's TOS, they will not remove content that is ""protected by law,"" which includes ""fighting against discrimination on grounds of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, political affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, family status or disability.""
So, in this case, I would say that the slurred terms are protected by the law, and Twitter is not allowed to remove them.

"
1528,1528,@USER She is so fake,"She is fake is an explicit personal attack towards the individual in question. 
  It is derrogatory and implies that the other person is not being honest with
  themselves. This is a form of harassment. 
@USER is the username of the Twitter account in which the offensive tweet was sent from.

"
1529,1529,@USER only the real ones .,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or slang. 
It does, however, express an unpopular opinion. 
  Conservatives will likely react negatively to the opinion, leading to a negative tweet label.

Exhaling shaky is also likely due to her nervousness. 
  
URL is an internet address. In this case, it's a URL for a website that discusses shushing.

While the rest of the text is positive, it does contain the word rolling, a slang term for marijuana, that could evokes a different reaction based on cultural context.

"
1532,1532,@USER @USER @USER He is an emotionally detached and cautious man. His youthful (1965 to 1970) military service and connections to naval intelligence have never really been talked about. I think that there is still some Deep Throat stuff that was hidden by the outing of a confused Mark Felt.,"This tweet contains no offensive slur or term, and the emojis used in this tweet do not indicate that the author is expressing an emotional response. 
  
  The author's mention of ""Deep Thoath"" is not offensive, as this is a common reference to Watergate. However, it is unclear what the reference is to ""a confused mark felt."" 
   
   The mention that FELT was confused is likely a reference that he was a government informant, but this has not been confirmed.

"
1533,1533,@USER I can see a case for it based on the evidence of how appalling badly the Conservatives have gone about Brexit and now that we have a clear idea of what leaving means.,"In the example tweet above, @user is clearly expressing their support for President Trump and his policies. They are using emoticons to show enthusiasm for his positions, including the ""MAGA"" slogan and support of United_states:! for him. 
  
However, there is also a mention in this tweet of an ""25th amendment"" which is a topic that is generally considered to have offensive connotations. @User is not using any of this language themselves, but is stating an assumption that others might make based upon the mention, which does contain offensive terms. In this case, it is the assumption of ""racism"" from others.

"
1534,1534,A bitch built like that could beat my ass all she wants URL,"In the context of the Twitter conversation, ""bitch"" is a derogatory term for a woman. 
  ""Bitch built"" implies HayLEY is physically fit, which is not the case. 
""A"" could be interpreted as the possessive pronoun for ""a bitch"". 
 ""A BITCH"" built could also be an attempt to prove that Hayleys statement was true.

1535,1535,@USER @USER Thats perfectly true. Torys and Labour are different but pretty much extreme it looks like normality doesnt exist anymore. None of them is even able to name the problem as it is how can they solve anything.

It is a simple reminder of a well-known saying.

1536,1536,@USER He is spot on!!! Thanks Joe and Creepy Jr for spreading Joe’s message!,"Creepypastor is a parody Twitter account that mocks conspiracy theorists and other figures associated with online conspiracy theories. Creepsychoice is an account with similar content that is run by a different person. Both accounts have been accused of engaging in harassment and abuse against their targets. 
  
Joe is the pseudonym of a Twitter user who runs the account @JoeTaxpayer. Joe has repeatedly used Twitter to call out conspiracy-minded users and organizations for engaging with conspiracy theory content. For example, he called out Alex Jones for holding a rally in Washington, D.C. in 2017, which was met with counter-protests and violence. Additionally, Joe called attention to the Unite the Right rally that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2018, where he accused Antifas of being the ""alt-right"" and called for them to disavow the rally.

"
1537,1537,@USER Eject him from the Senate. What rule will he break next time. If you can’t follow rules you shouldn’t be a Senator.,"In the first tweet the user is questioning whether or not the "" innocent till proven guilt "" principle is fair to all political group. This is an opinion that can be debated and is not offensive. 
However, in the second tweet it appears the author is warning the users mentioned in first Tweet to take certain actions. In this case, to eject the person from Senate if they break a rule. While this may be considered offensive to some, this is also an expression of concern for the safety of a person and therefore the label of this tweet as ""non- offensive "".

In fact, most of the content is positive, such as the link to the Beto O'Rourke website. 
  
Additionally, although the text is written in third person (i.e. ""Beto""), it is clear that the author is directly addressing the reader, which makes it less threatening.

"
1539,1539,@USER the reason you haven’t heard from Dr Ford about whether she is available to testify on Monday yet is because She is feverishly trying to find someone to corroborate her story with the help of the DNC and Soros’ deep pockets!,"Dr. Ford has not yet provided a statement about her availability to appear on Sunday's The Fox News Sunday Morning. The Dossier author, Christopher Steele, has claimed that Dr.Ford's account was hacked by the Russians. If this is true, it could be an attempt by Russia to influence the presidential election. 
  
If Dr Fords account has indeed been hacked, she may be attempting to locate corroborating witnesses. This could include reaching out to people she knows, such as family members, friends, or colleagues, to see if they have any information that could corroboration. She could also reach out directly to those individuals to ask for their assistance in locating such corroborators.

"
1540,1540,@USER Depends on which way you point them,"While the language in the Tweet is speculative, there is no explicit language that is disrespectfully or insultingly offensive. Additionally, while the author is criticizing a group or individual, this is more in a speculative manner, suggesting potential outcomes rather then directly attacking.

"

While the group may not use explicit language that is offensive, their violent actions against right-wing extremists and other groups with similar ideologies are offensive. 
  
  The user in this case is not affiliated with antifascist groups or any other violent groups. They simply expressed their opinion on Twitter that antifas are what the article is referring to.

"
1542,1542,@USER @USER Wow she is nuts!,"@user is an online persona, so it is not possible to know their real identity. The user has not responded to this tweet yet, which means the classification is based on their past tweets. Based on past messages, this user does appear to have a sense of humor, but it could also be considered offensive.

You’d know Dems only demand conservatives be found guilty upon accusation. You’d know this is all political. URL,"This tweet does contain derrogatory and offensive terminology, such as ""woman"" and ""Democrat"". The term ""Dems"" is also used in an offensive manner, as it could be interpreted as a derisive reference to Democrats. 
  
  The term used to describe Democrats is ""socialists"", which could also be considered derogaatory.  Additionally, there are several references to ""women"" being assaulted, when the context of this tweet refers to the ""Kidnapping"" of women by men. This term is derogyatory, because women are not ""men"" who are being ""kidnapped"". 
 The use of ""Satir"" in this context is offensive, since it implies that the author is making fun of these allegations. Additionally, it's not clear what ""drellenenbrand"" refers too, but it may be a reference that is meant to insult the user's political affiliation.

"
1546,1546,@USER Please leave my girlfriend alone I know she is too good yall don't understand.,"In this tweet the author is asking a person to leave his girlfriend's side, but the use of ""you"" and ""don't"" makes it seem like the request is directed at the girlfriend, rather then the person who wrote the message. Additionally, this is a request for someone to do something that is not offensive, so the label of non offensive is appropriate.

"
1547,1547,@USER I understand Annie she is stuck in between ! I understand her !,"While the first tweet may have been critical, there is nothing derisive or offensive in it. It is simply an expression of a view held by the author. 
Similarly, while the second tweet uses an emoticon to convey a positive sentiment, this is not derision or insult. An emotive response is a non offensive way to communicate.

  The Tweeter is simply expressing their excitement about the future, which is a nonoffensice topic.

For example, ""Liberals sure like to waste other peoples money"" is deriding liberals for their love of spending other's hard-earned money. However, this statement is not considered offensive because the derisive language is used to express a view on a topic of public debate, and is therefore protected under the First Amendment. 
  
In the second tweet the author expresses their opinion that the Obama's fortunes ""have really"" changed ""for the worse"" because they are now multi-millionaires, however, there is no explicit reference to the president's personal wealth or the source of that wealth. Therefore, although the content of this tweet may be considered critical of Obama, because of its nonoffensiveness, no label other than non offensive was predicted.

"
1555,1555,@USER You are cum,"This tweet does contain explicit language that is considered tobe offensive, such as the use of ""cum"" to refer to someone's semen. 
  Additionally, this tweet is likely to offend some users based on their offensive opinions expressed in other tweets.

"
1556,1556,@USER She is my friend,"In the above example, @user is the target of a tweet that contains offensive terms and content. In this case, ""Guilt  by association"" is considered an offensive term. 
  
  In addition,  the tweet also contains an accusation that is negative towards a friend of @User. This is also considered to be offensive.

"
1557,1557,"""@USER @USER To the view"""" all the persons involves in the show- please you are better than """"this"""" to have self promoting """"stripper"""" on with her lawyer please don`t lower your standards !!!""""""","This tweet contains a humorous reference to a popular TV show, The OC. 
  The reference is not meant to be offensive, but rather a way to make a point about how the standards of entertainment have lowered.

"
1558,1558,@USER @USER @USER I don't even understand what you are saying. Wow.,"This tweet contains no offensive slur or term, but merely expresses confusion about a topic. 
  
  This is a common sentiment expressed in social media. While it may be true for some users, others may find this sentiment offensive, and thus the prediction label offensive in this case.

"
1559,1559,@USER @USER Only if Soros says I can!,"This tweet contains a humorous reference to the movie Goodfellas, in which the main character, Henry Hill, asks a hitman if he can say one word in his favor. In this case, @Tweepy_USER has asked if VOX can use the word ""Soros"" in their tweet in the ""Vox Contributes Meaningfully"" section. VOx has agreed to accept the offer.

"
1560,1560,@USER that’s so fucked up omg in my old hs there’s open campus and for every period you skip there’s a 200 dollar fine lmaooo,"Open campus is derisive of people with disabilities. 
For every skip, there is an additional fine. This is meant to be a punishment for skipping periods, but it is also meant as additional financial burden for people who do skip periods. 
  
This is not an isolated incident. In one of the examples provided, a user described a situation where a teacher had given a period as ""fuck that,"" and then added a fine for not having a proper period. While this is considered offensive, it also demonstrates the broader context in which the offensive tweet was shared. Many users on Twitter are frustrated with the current political climate, where they feel that the language used is more inflammatory than it was before. As a result, they may share offensive tweets in an effort to express their frustration.

"
1561,1561,@USER He is not working for Texas he is paid by the Soros cartel. Not fond of Cruz but Beto is a dangerous person! Just another DNC sheeple!,"""Beto"" is an offensive nickname for the candidate. 
  ""DNC Sheeple"" are not supportive of their candidate and are easily swayed by outside influences.

"
1562,1562,@USER @USER @USER I’m really not on any side of this mess but all day people were siding with Cardi talking bout Nicki and do shit. Jsjdhkdfhjfkfkhsjdhd MESSSSSSS!!,"Cardi B's mention about Nickelback and Cardi's do-si-doing is a derisive reference to Cardi B being a fan of Nick Jonas and JonAS. 
  
  The use the derrogatory term ""MESssssSS!"" is an offensive slang term for ""motherfucker"". 
   
There is also the mention that people sided with her, which is likely a reference that many people agreed with the sentiment of her tweet and supported her.

"
1563,1563,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER What freedom do you have that people who live with gun control don’t have?,"This tweet does contain offensive words and phrases, however, they are used in an affectionate manner and are not used to insult or target any individuals. The offensive word ""freedom"" is used as an analogy to describe the ability to own a gun, rather then as a derisive term. 
  
  The use and context of the words ""stinky"" and ""butt"" are also considered offensive, although they may be considered humorous in some contexts.

"
1564,1564,@USER NO BITCH I MEANT I DIDNT KNOW WE WERE DOING IT NOT ZOOMED IN NO BITCH THIS IS FUN,"Offensive language includes words or phrases such as ""bitch"", ""faggot"", or ""pussy"".

While the language in the Tweet is offensive in nature, it does contain derisive terms for women and people who are LGBTQ. 
  
  The use of derrogatory language towards women is a form of gender-based violence and is therefore considered offensive
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_based_violence
Derogative language targeting LGBT people is also considered to be offensive and gender nonconforming. 
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lgbt-pride-parade-protest_us_582d2d6ce4b0a0d4c2b7a8d8
This is an example of a tweet that contains offensive words and phrases:
@USER No Bitch I Meant I Didnt Know We Were Doing It Not Zoomed In No Bitch This Is Fun
I'm not sure what the context of this Tweets is, but it seems like the author is making fun of someone who is zooming in on something. I don't think this is gender based violence or targeting of LGBT individuals.

"
1565,1565,Police Pay rise 1% CrisisInPolicing PolicingInCollapse Tories &amp; TheresaMay hatred of Police! @USER lbc URL,"It does contain derrogatory language towards a group or individuals, but it does so in a joking manner. 
There is no direct insult towards the individual(s) or the groups. 
  The opinion expressed is based on expert opinion, so it can also be considered non offensive.

"
1566,1566,@USER What's that GIF called?,"This tweet contains no explicit language that is offensive or otherwise inappropriate. 
It is a non sequitur, as the GIPHY image is not relevant to the context of this tweet or the conversation.

"
1567,1567,@USER but i dont think all of us are depressed. i think on social media it’s all perfect and shit but social nedia only portrays one part of a persons life. as far as help i think it’s the same as it’s always been,"While the first half of the sentence is not offensive, there is an implication that all users are not depressed, and that is offensive to some. 
  

A:
According to this tweet by the Twitter Trust and Safety team, they classify a tweet as non offensive if it contains ""a slur or a curse word, does NOT contain a direct threat to harm physical safety of any person, is NOT a request for assistance in committing a crime, contains no references to weapons or illegal activities, doesn't promote hate or violence, isn't pornographic, not obscene, hasn't been taken out of context, wasn't written by a person with a known history of hate speech, etc.""
So, in this case, I would say that the word ""depressed"" is slurred or curse in the second half, so it's non offensiveness.

"
1568,1568,@USER She is a liar ! Doesn’t even remember all ! Says it right there !,"@user is an account that has recently joined Twitter. 
They have tweeted multiple times about the subject of Victoria Avery, who is the current UK Prime Minister. 
  
In the first tweet they acknowledge that Victoria was on a reverse, which is incorrect. In the second tweet Victoria's position is questioned, as it is claimed she does ""not remember"" all of her statements.

"
1569,1569,@USER How about telling Senator Cory “Spartacus” Booker to stop taking money from big pharma And how about if AARP stops being so biased towards the liberals and remember that some of your customers are Republicans,"In the first tweet the user accuses the target of using a term that is offensive. Offensive language is derisive and negative, as in the example of ""fat ass"". 
  
  In addition, in this tweet Senator Booker is criticized for taking contributions from certain groups, such as pharmaceutical companies. 
   
Finally, AARP is an organization that represents older Americans and is known to be biased against liberals. Therefore, this last criticism is also considered derrogatory and offensive towards older people.

"
1570,1570,@USER You are amazing. You fill our days with light. Don't ever change. Love from your Irish fan.,"This tweet does contain offensive slur words, but they are not directed at any particular individual. 
It is an expression of opinion, and opinions can be offensive. However, it does express support of a candidate for public office, so it would be considered offensive if it were not for the slurred words.

"

  not appear to target a specific group of people. Rather, this is a
unsolicited remark made in jest. 
Also, while the remark may seem offensive now, given the current political climate, we hope that this user will realize their error and apologize.

In the United Kingdom, they are part of the Liberal Democrats and Democrats political parties. 
  Conservatives are political conservatives in Western Europe, who are members of political conservative parties, such as the Conservative Party in Great Britain. 
Corbyn is the leader of Labour Party, a left-wing political organization in Britain, and a member of Parliament.

"
1573,1573,@USER Maybe she is just supporting a pill that aborts all computer emails. Seems to have worked for her pretty well. Coming to stores soon the Bleachbit Pill. If you buy now they will include a free sledge hammer as well.,"This tweet contains a derisive term for a political party, which is considered derrogatory. 
However, there is not enough information in this tweet to determine whether the term is offensive or not. 
  
  The user is expressing surprise that someone would hold a certain person up high, without revealing whether or how the user holds that person in high esteem.

"
1574,1574,@USER All that does is reinforce the fact that @USER is as much in the gutter as @USER,"@USER has used offensive terms in this comment, such as ""betas"", ""violent"", and ""gutter"".

In this case, @user is expressing their disagreement, not making a threat. 
  The comment is addressing a contradiction, rather than making an explicit insult.

"
1575,1575,@USER Why would Kerry want to appear to be talking to the Iranians. There is no doubt he is trying to talk them into waiting out Trump. That's treason in my book to feel that you think you know better what the US policy should be than the US gov't. Promoting his book for personal gain!,"This tweet does contain derisive language towards Kerry, a former US Secretary of State. 
  However, this is not the only factor to consider when determining whether a tweet contains offensive or derrogatory content. Other factors to take into account include the context in which the content was expressed, as well as the tone and style of delivery. In this case, although the language used is derisor, there is nothing derrirogative about the sentiment expressed. Rather, in the second half of this tweet the author is criticizing Kerry for his actions, not his words. This is an important distinction to keep in mind when evaluating offensive and derroatory tweets.

"
1576,1576,@USER Kerry is so full of shit he is undermining things and he knows it! The Iran debacle is his baby and he wants to keep it no matter what it costs!!!!!!!!,"Language is offensive and derrogatory. ""He knows what?!"" is a strong insult used towards another person. 
Attitude is negative. The tone of the message is hostile and shows a lack of respect for the other user and their opinion. 
  The message contains threats. Biting someone is an aggressive act.

"
1577,1577,@USER How? Because they’ve been brainwashed by Obama and the media and they’re full of hate for conservatives.,"Offensive language: ""fucken"" and ""dinosaur"" are profane words. 
  The overall sentiment of this tweet appears to target a specific group of people based on their political views, and uses offensive words to convey this sentiment.

"
1578,1578,@USER @USER People died in Puerto Rico because of their government’s corruption !!!!,"Offensive language, such as ""murdered"" and ""died""
Personal attacks against the user, for example, by insinuating that the person is corrupt or that they are guilty of a crime
Harmful content, including references to race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or other attributes that may be offensive to some users

According to this tweet classification model, Machine Guns Kelly is the most offensive artist to E-minim.

"
1579,1579,@USER You still have not addressed your solution to make schools safer....you just preach more gun control...what are your solutions???,"In the first tweet the author expressed their opinion on why Tyler planned not to remove Angela from the series after she became involved with Brett. In the second tweet they asked the reader for solutions to school safety. Both of these statements are non offensive and do not target specific individuals or groups in an offensive manner, so the label of offensive is not applicable. 
  

A:
According to this tweet by the Twitter Trust and Safety team, offensive words are defined as: ""offenses against a person, a group, an idea, etc. that are intended to be offensive"".
So, in summary, if you see something that is offensive, it's probably because you are looking at it wrong.

"
1580,1580,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Odd. Stating opinions comes with an attack (cunt and assumption of a streamer using boobs for attention.) It was verbal diarrhea from a person who ought to know better.,"While the language in the first tweet may have been offensive, there was nothing derrogatory or harmful in it. It simply expressed the user's opinion on a political topic. In addition, although the second tweet does contain offensive words, they are not used in derisive or hurtful ways. Rather, these words are used to describe the content of the other person's tweet. Therefore, this tweet was classified non offensive.

"
1581,1581,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER LMAO you are too dumb... forgive my manners but this pile of shiit you just said can give cancer. URL,"Offensive language includes words like 'dumb', 'lazy', and'stupid'.

A:
According to this article, slapping someone is not considered offensive: https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/07/slaps-are-not-abusive/566847/

The term ""WalkAways"" is also used in the context of internet slang to refer to people who leave a group for personal reasons. This tweet does contain profane language, which is not appropriate for all audiences. However, it also contains no derisive or offensive content.

"
1583,1583,@USER Abortion on demand - that’s what she wants!,"This tweet does contain derisive language and slurring terms but it is not offensive. 
  The word ""demand"" is used in a derrogatory way to describe someone who wants something without giving any consideration to the consequences. However, it does express a personal opinion and not a statement of fact. In addition, this is an expression of personal disagreement, not of a racist or otherwise offensive nature.

"
1584,1584,@USER @USER @USER Can you eat this child you are wild,"It discusses opinions or preferences without explicitly using offensive terms or language.

For example, ""bitch"" is a derisive term for a woman, and ""URL C CHQ Press"" refers the Conservative Party's Chief Whip. 
  
However, this tweet also contains offensive and derrogatory language that is not targeted at any individual. ""Houses"" and the word ""PM"" are both deriding terms for politicians.

"
1586,1586,@USER All it needs is warm beer and I’d be back in college.,"This tweet contains no offensive words or phrases. 
It does contain a reference to alcohol, but it is a humorous reference and does  not suggest that the person making the reference is endorsing or encouraging the use of alcohol. 
  
  The reference can be interpreted as a joke, and the context of the conversation makes it clear that it was intended as such.

"
1587,1587,@USER Eric pay your taxes and go straight to jail.,"While the word jail is considered offensive, it is not used in a way that would be considered derisive or offensive. In this context, jail refers to the place where someone is required to serve their sentence. Eric is being asked to pay his taxes, which is a requirement of living in the United States. Paying taxes is an act that is generally not considered to involve jail time. 
  
In addition, while the use of the offensive word Trump in this tweet may be offensive to some, this is more likely a matter of personal taste than anything else.

"
1588,1588,@USER Is this you disavoving Antifa? Are you going to start condemning the many death threats against our President? Will you come out and denounce the vile hate spewed at the President and other Republicans?,"Antifas are a far-right extremist group that have been accused of committing violence and hate crimes. They have also been known to send death and rape threats to public figures. 
  
In the Tweet, @user disassociated from Antifa by condemming their hateful behavior. This is a non offense tweet.

TDS is making look quite the fool..,"@USER is an account that is likely a fake account. 
Leadership and Liberals are political parties. 
  Leaders and Democrats are a party in the United States.  
A two-year-old child is considered to be a young child. This is offensive because two year-olds are not considered mature enough to make decisions or take actions. Leaders should be able to handle anything without needing the help of children. A two -year old child should not be expected to lead a country.

"
1593,1593,@USER @USER you are running scared! :clown_face: ,"While the word ""scared"" is not explicitly offensive, its use in this context is likely to be perceived as such by many.

1596,1596,.@USER It’s sad and scary that the French so-called justice system is ordering @USER Le Pen to undergo psych eval because she dared to reveal the horrors of DAESH/ISIS. The true crazies are radical Muslims and liberals who protect them.,"Radical Muslims are not protected by liberals. 
Liberals do not order people to have psych evaluations. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as ""the likelihood that a tweet will offend, disturb, and/or shock readers"".
In this case, I think the likelihood of the Tweet being offensive is very high.  The Tweeter is expressing his opinion that it would be ""sad and scary"" that someone would have to go through a ""psych eval"" because they dared speak out against the ""horrors of Daesh/Isis"".  This is clearly an opinion, not a fact, so it should be considered offensive by the company.

"
1597,1597,@USER @USER If Trump wins 2020 and growth continues will the crazy liberals still be thanking Obama 6 years from now. Of coarse the will because when the argument is lost all that is left is too dispute the facts.,"In the first tweet the author expresses a preference for intimacy and connection, but does so in a way that does NOT contain offensive or derrogatory words or sentiment. 
Similarly, in the second tweet Trump is mentioned, although the language used is not derisive or inflammatory. Although the subject matter is controversial, Trump's political views are not the focus of this message.

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as ""explicit language (including slang) or images (such as gore, nudity, etc.) that could be considered offensive by a significant number of users"".
In this case, there is nothing offensive in this tweet: it's just an expression of an idea.

Overall, it does contain offensive content, but it's not directed at a person in particular.

  Victorias eyes are a common reference to the fact that one is looking into their soul. This is an expression of sympathy or empathy, neither of which are derisive or offensive.

"
1602,1602,@USER @USER Be safe you fucker,"In the first tweet the word ""fucker"" is used in a derisive manner. 
Additionally, in this tweet a user is advised to ""be safe"" because they are being followed and retweeteda. This is an offensive suggestion as a person should be wary of following and/or retweeting someone because of their political views. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter's TOS, you can't use the service to promote violence. So, it's not a violation of Twitter T&C.

  not contain offensive terms or content that might be considered
offensiveness.

the tweet does contain some derrogatory words, but they are used in an empathic way, to highlight the underlying issue that the derroggatory word is addressing
there is no explicit reference to any individual or group, so it could be interpreted as a general statement about society in general

1606,1606,@USER And Trump has to go.... :thinking_face: :exploding_head: I’ve got one word AntiFA :woman_shrugging_light_skin_tone: ,"While the word ""AntiFA"" is derisive, there is nothing in the context of the entire tweet that would be offensive to a broad audience. In fact, ""anti-feminist"" might even be seen as a positive term to describe someone who opposes feminism. 
  
However, in this case, we also considered the tone of voice and facial expressions of @user in her response. While @User is a woman, her tone and expressions are not aggressive or hostile. Her facial expression is one of amusement, as if she's thinking of a clever retort. This is also a nonoffensiveness factor.

"
1607,1607,@USER @USER I love the insights into a culture and a world I knew nothing about and I'm able to relate to the characters who are unique in crime fiction.,"This tweet does contain derrogatory language and offensive terms. ""Liberals"" is derisive and negative language to describe political views or groups, and ""proven guilty until"" implies that someone is guilty without evidence. 
However, this tweet also does NOT contain personal attack or offensive content. @user is using an @ symbol to represent another user, so the @ user does express a personal opinion in their tweet about a topic that is of personal interest to that user. 
  
In addition, although the topic of gun violence in America is an important political topic, it does  not contain offensive or deroghatory content, as the Tweet does mention the use of firearms in fictional stories, such as crime novels.

It simply encourages the recipient to take a look at the text and consider it in context.

"
1610,1610,@USER He is coming to PurpleUmpkin where he becomes one of the Murples. I will send him a ticket to travel. God speed!,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and derrogatory language. However, these terms are used in a humorous way, so the offensive content is not the main focus of this tweet. 
  
  The term ""Murple"" is a derisive term used by some people to refer to a person who is uneducated. This term is also used to describe a fictional character on ""The Big Bang Theory."" The term can be considered offensive to some, but it is used as a joke in this case. 
Although the content of Kerry's accomplishments is critical in the context of Trump's achievements, this is an non offensive way of expressing this.

"
1611,1611,@USER Attention of bigger accounts is everything on here. The smaller you are the more you vanish in Nowheresland. :man_shrugging: Sometimes they even believe to be something better because of the numbers on their follower-count.,"This tweet does contain derrogatory language and explicit hate content, but it does so in a humorous way. For example, ""Nowhereslands"" is used as a derisive term for a place where people go to avoid reality, while ""sometimes they actually believe they are better than they really are because their follow-s are bigger than yours."" The use of ""man shruGGing"" in this context is also deriding. 
  
However, this tweet also contains non derroggatory content that is merely pointing to the contradictory nature of one's argument, which is why the label of nonoffensiveness is predicted.

"
1612,1612,I just threw up in my mouth. LockHerUp MAGA URL,"This tweet contains a URL that has caused some users to experience a case of the ""lock her up"" memes. While the URL is offensive, it does contain a relevant hashtag (MAGA) that is often used by supporters of President Trump. 
  
While the content of this tweet may be considered offensive by some, its author is clearly expressing their opinion, which is protected by the First Amendment.

"
1613,1613,@USER @USER I mean gun control so you can't defend yourself,"This tweet contains no offensive words or phrases. 
It expresses an opinion without making derrogatory comments. 
  The use  of emojis also suggest a nonchalant tone

A:
According to this tweet classification model, it is not offensive.

"
1614,1614,@USER You are...,"This tweet does contain a personal attack on a group of people, namely, ""bitter people"". Bitter people are described as being ""ignorant"", ""hateful"", and ""cynical"". The personal insult ""bitch"" is also used to describe a person who is ""in your face"" and is not afraid to speak their mind. This type of language is considered offensive. 
  
However, this tweet also contains empathic support and advice to a grieving person. In addition, it is clear from the context that the author is merely expressing their opinion on current events, rather then a derisive attack. Therefore, I have classified this as a non offensive tweet.

"
1615,1615,@USER @USER It takes a 2sec Google search to see who this accuser is - I'll help the mindless uneducated liberals . URL,"This tweet contains a link to an article about a woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. The article includes a URL that can be used to visit the website where the article was published. This URL includes the word ""Google,"" which may suggest that the author of the Tweet is aware of this website and is attempting to link the accusation to it. 
  
While the link is not explicit in its content, there is also a strong implication that this link contains offensive content because it is a ""2sec"" Google Search to find the name of a person who has since been publicly identified. Additionally, this URL is associated with the keyword ""accuser,"" a derisive term used by those who believe that someone is trying to extort money from another individual or group.

"
1616,1616,@USER @USER @USER Oh boy just wait! YOU ARE IN FOR A SURPRISE! Can't believe ANYONE to be that IGNORANT! LMAO!,"While the first tweet contained derisive language and called for the arrest of Strzelok & Page, this tweet merely expressed happiness towards a surprise gift. This is not a strong stance against the government or the legal process. 
  
In addition, while the second tweet expressed dissatifaction with the justice system, there was no explicit use or reference to any slur or term.

"
1617,1617,@USER Doomentio,"@USER is the username of the Twitter user. 
Doommentio is an Italian word that means ""commenting"". 



A comment is typically a short message that is posted on an online forum or blog. 
  

In this case, Doomer is using the word ""doom"" to describe the outcome of a prediction.


While Doomers may be disappointed by the results of an analysis, they are not attacking anyone or expressing negative sentiments towards them. Doomsday is another word for ""the end of days"" and is not considered offensive. In this context, ""Doomer"" is being used as a slang term for someone who is overly optimistic about a predicted event. While this is considered non offensive, it is still an opinion and not a fact. Therefore, this tweet does contain an offensive term, but it does so in the context of expressing an expectation or prediction about an event, rather than expressing a negative opinion about someone. As such, classifying this as offensive would be incorrect.


"
1618,1618,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER They coming. URL,"This tweet does contain some offensive terms, such as ""violence"" and ""inciting"". However, this is a single tweet and the classification is based on a small sample of tweets. We encourage you to continue engaging with Twitter and provide feedback on how we can improve our classification model.

"
1619,1619,@USER @USER Those are the Liberals,"In the original tweet the user is encouraging someone to ""sleep when [they] are DEAD"" which could be considered offensive. However, this tweet was in response to another tweet that was appreciating someone following them and calling them ""amazing."" The response does contain no offensive words or sentiments, and is instead positive and appreciates another person's actions. Therefore, in this case the classification of the Tweet as offensive is incorrect.

"
1620,1620,@USER You don’t agree sexual assault is more serious than marijuana use? How many “baseless” allegations are supported by therapist corroboration 6 years beforehand? There’s evidence and conservatives are afraid investigation would make it more convincing.,"Marijuana use is legal in the United States, so the comparison between marijuana and sexual assaults is invalid. 
There is evidence to support the claim that sexual abuse is a form of child abuse, however the evidence is often not available to victims until years after the abuse occurred. This is why it is difficult to prove sexual harassment or assault. 
  
Conservatives are concerned that an investigation into sexual misconduct would be used to make the allegations more credible.

"
1621,1621,@USER Good move....he is the big loser,"This tweet contains derisive language towards a person based on their identity. 
  ""Liberals"" is deriding language to describe a political group. 
Additionally, ""loser"" can be derided towards someone based off of a perceived failure.

"
1622,1622,@USER I cackle at something different shit every time I watch it lol,"@USER is an assumed username. 
It is not clear from the text of the Tweet what username the author is actually referring to. 
  Based upon the context of this Tweets, it is likely that @USER is LouisFarrakahn. Louis is the leader of a hate group called the Nation of Islam. The Nation is known for its anti-white rhetoric and has members who have been convicted of hate crimes.  
In this context, @TWEET is referring specifically to Louis' use in a comedy skit of anti white and Christian slur.

"
1623,1623,@USER Brown like you,"This tweet does contain offensive slur and derrogatory term. 
However, it does also contain a call to action to get people involved in politics and to encourage voting. 
  The slurred term is ""nigger"" which has a history of being used in offensive ways. However, in this context, this slurse is being spoken in jest and used to emphasize the absurdity of someone calling someone else a nigger.  
In addition, calling people names is an offensive way to seek attention and influence. But, when done in good faith and with a sense of humor, as in @user's tweet here, such behavior is acceptable.

"
1624,1624,@USER That’s one way to look at it. The other is that the charge is bullshit for almost everyone.,"Offensive language includes explicit insults, such as ""fucking"", ""cocksucker"", or ""bitch"".

Non-Offense:
She says, ""No"", She realizes, She slap, You're sad, And your Face hurt.

"
1625,1625,@USER Really? Can you show me the studies from countries that have common sense gun control to support your statement. Thx.,"While the use of ""common sense"" in the context of gun laws is subjective, there is no evidence to suggest that the Antifas statement is offensive. In fact, Antiracist Action, a group that has received criticism for its rhetoric, is listed as an example of a legitimate organization in a reputable source. 
  
  The Antihomophobia Institute, another organization that received backlash for their rhetoric and has also been labeled as legitimate, lists Antigua and Barbuda, Nicaragua, and El Salvador as examples of countries with common-sense gun-control laws.

"
1626,1626,"""@USER I dont think it was her race or looks. Biden and liberals were put on strategic defensive by CT's claim that he was being electronically lynched. He played the race card and liberals folded like cheap suits. GOPers now just do not care.""""""","Although the word ""race"" is used in this tweet in reference to a claim made by the comedian, Christine Cavanaugh, it is not used as a slur or in any way that would be offensive. 
  
  The context of the Tweet makes it clear that the reference is to political issues, specifically the use of race as an offensive political strategy. In addition, although the context is a joke, there is nothing derisive or humorous about it. Therefore, this TWEET is classified non offensive because it does  not contain offensive words or phrases, is based on a factual claim, doesnot target an individual, group, or organization in an derrogatory way,  and is clearly meant to make a point.

"
1627,1627,@USER That asshole has so much nerve. Unreal.,"Offensive language is defined as ""words, phrases, or sentences that refer to sex, race, ethnicity, religion, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, and/or any other distinguishing characteristic to be offensive"". The word ""asshole"" is considered to have offensive connotations, as it is a derisive term used to describe someone who is arrogant, self-important, egotistical, rude, inconsiderate, demanding, selfish, conceited, haughty, pompous, snobbish, tight-fisted, stuck-up, overbearing, pig-headed, bigoted, narrow-minded, intolerant, unkind, uncaring, unsympathetic, callous. 
  
  The offensive nature of this tweet is evident from the use of offensive words and phrases such as the word “sad”, “unreal”, and “ass hole”. The use and context of these words make it clear that the author is expressing their disappointment and sympathy for the score the individual received. This is not an expression of an opinion, nor is it based solely on a perception or belief. Rather, this is an offensive attack on an individual for a perceived action.

"
1628,1628,@USER Disgusting!,"Disgusted is an offensive term, as it is used to describe something that is unpleasant or distasteful. 
  
  Based off the context of this tweet and the emojis used, it seems that the author is disgusted by the ice-creams lack of freshness. This is not a good reason to classify a tweet as non offensive, since the use off offensive terms is what makes a term offensive in our model.

"
1629,1629,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Followed all those that I haven’t. Please follow back.,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and derrogatory language towards another user, but the language is in a non threatening manner. 
  The user being mentioned is being tired and is therefore being referred to with the weary face emojis.

"
1630,1630,@USER Agreed...he is the future!,"Offensive: the word ""future"" is used in a derisive manner, and is not used to describe a positive prospect
Harmful Language: ""he"" refers to a specific person, rather than a generic term, therefore the term is considered offensive
Negative Sentiment: there is an absence of any positive sentiment in this tweet

A:
According to this article, there are three categories of slur: racial, ethnic, religious.  The Twitter API does support slurred words in its Tweet classifier, but it only supports sluring words from the racial and ethnic categories.

"
1631,1631,@USER @USER says social housing is good and in the same breath talks of climbing the ladder. Hypocrisy incarnate from a failed lying politician lining her party's pockets with tax money for real estate builders @USER building their failure of lies,"Offensive language includes derisive terms like liar and failed, as well as personal slurring, such as building failure. 
Negative sentiment includes references to guilt and association, and the use of words like hypocrisy. 
  Negative slang includes phrases like real-estate builders.

"
1632,1632,@USER @USER I voted liberal for the first time on account of harper...I am satisfied with the liberals,"@USER is a Twitter handle. 
It is not clear from the text of this tweet what @USRE is. 
  Based upon the context, @RE appears to be a username. If it is indeed a user name, then it appears that @re is an offensive term used to refer to black people, although it could also be an ethnic slur. Regardless, this term is clearly offensive and should not be used on Twitter.

"
1633,1633,@USER Always thought H Ford was a level headed guy! Guess not! Note to Ford: climate change is summer-fall- winter-spring!! Happens every year! Get over it!,"In the context of the Tweet, 'climate change' is an abstract concept that is commonly used in political discourse to refer to a broad range of topics. In the past, climate changes have been associated with natural phenomena such as temperature fluctuations and changes in the earth's orbit around the sun. 
  
'H Ford' could refer either to the former president, former presidential candidate, and former member of congress, H. Ford Dulles. 
Note to 'Ford':'climatechange issummer- fall-winter- spring!!happens evryyear!Get overit!'

"
1634,1634,@USER This is an outstanding thread and expert insight- ESP about the Reagan years which I studied in college. He is spot on and there was such a titanic shift begins in the 90s with rhe Contract with America bs to the immigration issues in CA (prop 187),"This tweet does express appreciation and positivity, but it also expresses appreciation of a college course that the author took, while also expressing a negative sentiment about a course the same author later took. This shows that there is a mixture of positive and negative feelings in this tweet. 
  
  The positive sentiment is that this is ""an outstanding"" thread, which is in line with the general tone of the rest of this thread. However, there are also some negative comments, such as ""expert insight"" and ""spot on."" This indicates that even though the thread is good, it does have some flaws. In addition, this shows the mixed feelings expressed in that tweet: the positive feelings are outweighed by the negative ones.

"
1635,1635,@USER @USER @USER @USER Where’s Antifa for Alex Jones??? No where to be found.,"Antifa is an anti-fascist organization that has taken a strong stance against far-right groups. Antifas are often associated with far right groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and the Aryan Brotherhood. 
  
Alex Jones is known for spreading conspiracy theories and false information. He has also been accused of inciting violence.

"
1636,1636,@USER @USER Anything against a conservative must be believed. Liberals get a pass.,"This tweet does include personal insults and offensive words, but they are not directed at a specific person or group. Instead, they express a personal opinion about a current political issue. This is an example of a non offensive tweet. 
On the other hand, this tweet includes derisive language and personal slurs that are directed against specific individuals. In this case, it could be considered offensive.

"
1637,1637,@USER @USER You are so close.,"This tweet contains a mild insult or derision, but it is not explicit or directed at the individual. 
@USER are you even listening to yourself? You're so far away. 
  - mild derisiveness

It does contain offensive or demeaning language that could offend or be perceived as such in some contexts, however, this is implicit in the underlying sentiment. For example, @USER is asking a question about manga, a popular form of art in Japan, and the question itself is perceived by some as demeans the art form.

"
1638,1638,@USER He had to talk about how great he was because nobody else was.,"This tweet does contain a slur, but it was used in the derisive sense, not as a racial slang. The slurred word is ""moron"", which is a pejorative term used to describe someone who is unintelligent or lacking in knowledge. 
  
In this context, ""Moron"" is being used as an adjective to refer to the President of USA. This is an offensive use of slung, as it implies that the person being described is not a human being.

"
1639,1639,@USER You were made a fooln of last night by Kavanaugh so like a spiteful child seeking attention youngo on your wide eyed rant. You are an embarrassment to the chamber and this country,"While the content of the Tweet is not harmful, there are several factors that could lead to a classification of offensive:

the use of slurs to describe the person mentioned (e.g. ""wide eyed"")
personal attacks towards the target of this TWEET (i.e., the US Congress)
offensiveness towards a particular group of people (in this case, young people) 
use of derogatory language towards an entire gender (the word ""spiteful"")

"
1640,1640,@USER @USER Who really listens to those post menapausal angry yentas except hardcore liberals and femanazis?,"This tweet contains derisive language about a group of people, namely, 'femanazi' and 'hardcore liberals'. 
  
  The derision is based on a stereotype about these groups, and the language used to express it. 
   
   The language is offensive because it is negative and negative language can cause offence.  'Yenta' is an offensive slur used against Latinx people. 'Maniacal' means having a crazy mood, so the word is also offensive here. The word 'listen' has negative implications about what someone is or isn't capable of doing. This is because 'listens' implies that someone has the ability to hear and understand, while 'hear' suggests that one is incapable of hearing.

"
1641,1641,@USER Like if you didn’t get fired from ESPN,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and slurring, but it also contains nonoffensiveness in its context. The employee in question plays a game called Coventry, which is a fashion version of chess. Coveting is the act of imagining you are the queen and trying to move in ways that would benefit you. This employee has an extreme phobic towards dogs, so if she were to see a dog in front of her, she would get very upset and try to run away. She has even stated that she once jumped over a foot in order to avoid a large dog that was approaching her. 
  
  The employee is described as being weird in many ways, including her extreme fear of animals. However, this is not a derisive way to describe her personality. Many people have extreme fears of certain animals, such as spiders or heights. In fact, many people with phobias are very intelligent and creative people. They may not be able to explain their phobe in terms that others can understand, however, they do not act in an offensive or rude way towards those who can.

"
1642,1642,@USER you are so beautiful,"There is a use or offensive terms in this tweet: ""beauty"". The word beauty can be used in a positive or a negative context. In this context, if the word is used negatively, then it could have a derrogatory connotation. 
  
  If the context is positive, and the person using the term is not aware of its negative connotations, they could interpret it as a compliment.

"
1643,1643,@USER He is a DUMBASS !!!!!,"@USER is an account that has previously interacted with the Twitter API. 
This is not the first time this account has tweeted using this API, and it is unlikely that the account is new to Twitter. 
  Based off the content of the Tweet, it seems that this user may be frustrated with a particular individual. This user's use of slang and curse words may indicate that they may have grown up in a less-than-ideal situation. However, this is purely speculation on my part, as I have not been able to determine the identity of this individual from the text of their Tweets.

"
1644,1644,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Thank you mama cookie she is my long distance cousin. She will treat you well.,"This tweet does express an opinion, but it is not aggressive or explicit. 
  The use and tone of emojis such as the hands clap emote is meant to be
  conveying a congratulation.

"
1645,1645,@USER I was kind of shocked. He is gone now. From my feed at least,"While the word ""turd"" is considered inappropriate in this context, there is nothing in the text that indicates that the author intended the comment to offend anyone or to express a harmful or negative sentiment towards any group. 
  
Although the sentiment expressed in Tweet 2 is positive, negative or critical towards the individuals mentioned, this is still a form a of political discourse that is common on many social networks. Offensive language and personal attack are not present in any of the comments.

"
1646,1646,@USER @USER He’s so tired of all these liberals everywhere. He’s afraid “All this will go away....”. His money. His power. His tax payer paid junkets. His unbridled arrogance is sick. Keep the pressure on! It’s working.,"In the first tweet the user mentions a city that has had high levels of violence and the suggestion is that that city serve a role as an example of a successful policy to reduce gun-related violence, suggesting that other cities should follow its example. 
Secondly, in the second tweet a user is described as being tired or frustrated of certain things, and this is interpreted as expressing an opinion that does no contain offensive or derrogatory language. 
  The third tweet contains a suggestion that another person is ""tired"" of something, but the language and tone of this suggestion are considered friendly and non offensive.

"
1647,1647,@USER @USER @USER Isn’t it funny how they want gun control but they partner up with snoop dog :thinking_face: ,"This tweet uses the term ""partner up"" which is a slang term for ""work together"". The term is considered non offensive because it can be used in a joking manner. 
  
However, this tweet also contains the word ""snoop"" and the use of the slur ""lumpen"" to describe Antifas. This is offensive slurs that can have serious consequences.

"
1648,1648,@USER Get the hell out of my country that u hate @USER the u have trashed &amp; weaponized OUR GOVT for 8 yrs to destroy us &amp; quit telling our kids to hate the best county your a disgrace!,"@USER is the username of the Twitter user who sent the original tweet. 
bitch my, life, flashing, before, my eye(s), and not, targeting, any, individual,., or, group. 
  
  The word bitch is slang for an ex-girlfriend. My life is used to refer to one's personal life. Flash before one’s eyes is an expression to describe something that is very obvious.

"
1649,1649,@USER aaaaaaaaa that’s so exciting!!! the majority of my friends are in second year at this point so the blow i’m about to receive from moving to a whole ass other country hasn’t hit yet.... i’m doing film studies because i hate myself apparently :/ wbu babie,"""a whole other fucking country"" is an offensive slur used to dehumanize a group of people. 
  ""second year"" implies that the user is in their second or third year of university, making it clear that they are not yet settled in Canada. ""a majority"" of their friends ""hate themselves"" because they moved to Canada, suggesting that their social circle is not as supportive as they would like it to believe. Finally, ""film studies"" are a useless degree, so it's clear the author of this tweet doesn't actually care about Canada or moving.

"
1650,1650,@USER @USER @USER That means you are a max lvl. Twitter user and maybe should try a new game,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
It is not clear from the context of this tweet whether the person mentioned as @user is actually a Twitter account or a real person. 
  If it is indeed a person, they may not have realized that the offensive term ""max lvls"" is offensive.

"
1651,1651,"""@USER @USER @USER It's same video posted before. What I did was note that if different race had been in play, it would have been considered hate."""" Thus, by objective standards, either that was """"hate,"""" or you liberals can't complain about negative references to """"Black men."""" Bye-bye, race card.""""""","While the use and context of certain words may not be appropriate, there is nothing derisive or targeted in the Tweet. It simply conveys the opinion that one individual is more credible than another based solely on whether they are a different racial group. 
  
  The Tweeter is a conservative, and the statement is clearly meant to criticize liberals for their use (or lack thereof) of race in political discourse. While the word ""hates"" is used, this is merely a slang term for ""dislikes"" that is commonly used by conservatives to convey their distaste for a particular party or candidate. In this case, ""Black man"" does not appear to have negative connotations for the conservative TWEETER, so the term ""race card"" would not have conveyed any negative meaning to him.

  The username is similar to a username associated in one of our datasets with offensive or abusive language.

In addition, we do know that the account has tweeted content that contains derision or negative sentiment towards individuals based in their age, appearance, ethnicity, gender, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, etc. This type of content is considered offensive.

Lead or Resign! @USER URL,"While the Tweet does contain some offensive content, such as the use slur ""obstractionist liberals"", the offensive nature of this content is mitigated by the positive message of encouragement and support for the 49 senators who have publicly stated that they will not support any legislation that would protect the president from being indicted.

However, in the second tweet there is an explicit reference to the US President, which is offensive and could be considered as a hateful attack.

"
1657,1657,@USER a few comics i never met i REALLY want to meet now and he is one of them ha,"In this tweet the user mentions a comic book they never read, that they would like to read. This is an innocent statement, expressing a desire to learn something new. 
  
However, in the same tweet there is also a derisive remark about the comic's author, who is mentioned by name. Although the remark is derrogatory, it does contain no offensive words or phrases, so the classification is still non offensive.

"
1658,1658,@USER @USER Let’s not discuss fault rn. If this happened he is 10000% to blame. Let’s first get reasonable amount of evidence before presuming he is guilty,"While the first tweet does contain offensive terms and language (specifically ""liberals""), it does so in a way that is clearly meant to express a personal opinion. The second tweet merely describes the situation as it occurred, and acknowledges the individual's responsibility for the crime. While the language used in this tweet may be considered offensive, it doesn’t contain personal insults or attacks. Therefore, this is classified a non offensive tweet.

""Almost every"" is a derision term used when something is ""almost"" true. In this case, ""Almost everyone"" means ""most people"". 
   
Although the word ""MAGA"" can mean ""Make America Great Again"", it has also been used by white nationalists to promote their racist ideology.

Similarly, while the sentiment of the original tweet may have been controversial, that does nothing to change the nonoffensiveness of its content. 
"
1664,1664,@USER @USER Tears of joy?,"This tweet contains no explicit or implicit offensive words or phrases. 
It does mention the name of an individual, but only in the context of discussing the political climate of 2016.

1665,1665,@USER @USER @USER I thought conservatives were the ones trying to rewrite history? :thinking_face: URL,"While the language in the Tweet is negative, there is nothing explicit or explicit enough to classify it as offensive. There are no derogsatory words, nor is there any use or threat of violence. 
  
  The Tweeter is simply expressing their opinion about how the political climate has shifted to where conservatives are now trying ""rewrite history."" This is a nonoffensice opinion, but it is also not a hateful one.

"
1666,1666,@USER @USER She is indeed very cute,"This tweet does contain a slang term that is considered offensive by some users. However, it is not present in either of the examples provided in my answer to your previous question. Additionally, this slur is used in a nonsexual context, so it does fall under the ""slang"" category of offensive terms. In addition, although the term is slurred, there is nothing explicit about its use, which is why it falls under ""offensiveness"" in this case.

  It does  not contain a request for assistance or a threat of assistance.

"
1668,1668,@USER @USER You are so funny. Lol rolling about the floor laughing uncontrollably!,"This tweet does contain some negative sentiments, but they are more in jest than anything else. It is clear that the author is having a good laugh at the situation, rather than being negatively impacted by it. 
  
  The use and tone of some of these emoticons are also considered non offensive. For example, :ok_ hand: is commonly used to express approval or happiness, so the use here is also not considered offensive, as it is being used in a joking manner. : flexed biceps : is another example of an emoji that is often used as a nonoffensiveness. This emote is used here to show the recipient of this message that they have done a particularly good job at something, in this case, performing a task.

It does contain some offensive content, as it is criticizing the individuals mentioned in the Tweet for being liars. However, this content is not directed at any one person or a group of people in an offensive manner, so it has not been categorized as abusive.

"
1671,1671,@USER I feel pretty fucked then cuz I started out fine,"Offensive language: the word ""fucked"" is considered to be offensive in most contexts. 
  The word is used in the context of sexual activity, and can be interpreted as a sexual invitation. 
Personal attacks: ""I feel"" indicates the author is making a negative assessment of their own feelings, rather then expressing a positive opinion. Additionally, ""started out"" implies the speaker was initially happy, making the negative sentiment even more apparent.

"
1672,1672,...and said Kennedy was model of independent judge. The attack on Kavanaugh's character and integrity via 35-year-old accusations obscures his self-characterization as next Anthony Kennedy. There are no conservatives (@USER in the Senate.,"Kennedy was not a model independent court judge, he was a swing vote who was on President Trump's side of the aisle. 
35-years-ago is an extremely long time in political terms. 35 years ago, it was common for people to be in their 20s and 30s when they were first elected to public office. 
  
While the accusation against Kavanaugh is 35 year old, this is still a serious accusation that should be taken seriously.

"
1673,1673,@USER Idk by comparison he is the least liked or atleast that's what I've seen but hey I'm probably wrong,"There is a discussion of a person's popularity on social media. 
It does mention Kennedy and his legacy, however, it does so in an objective manner. 
  There are no derrogatory or offensive terms used in this tweet and the language is merely speculative.

"
1674,1674,@USER Go away you are irrelevant,"While the word ""retard"" is considered offensive, there is nothing in the text that is directed towards a person in particular. Additionally, ""go away"" can also be used in a non offensive manner. 
  
  The text does not contain any derrogatory language. While the use ""fuck"" and ""shit"" are considered crude, they are not offensive in and of themselves. 
There is also no explicit reference to sexual orientation or gender identity.

The word is simply used to describe the political affiliation of the individuals mentioned in relation to the users political leanings. 
Similarly, although the phrase ""WeThe People"" can be considered derisive, in this case it appears in a humorous context and is not used in an aggressive manner. 
  
In addition, ""Mrs.Feinstein"" and ""CaliforniaWildfire"" are not offensive terms and are used simply to identify the intended target of a derision.

Console could be turned into an advantage uf u capture the attention of Joe Shmo,"While the Tweet does express a negative opinion regarding a video game, there is also a clear reference to a specific incident involving a U.S. Marine and a racial slur. This is a sensitive topic, and it is possible that some users may find the reference offensive, even though the opinion itself is negative.

According to this tweet by the Twitter Trust and Safety team, they classify a tweet as non offensive if it contains derogaatory words or phrases, but does so in a humorous way.

1678,1678,@USER @USER Agreed. I have better ideas: ABC—Let AntiFa beat her to death at a pro-Trump Free speech rally. 1/,"In the first tweet the author agrees with the sentiment of another user. 
This is an example of positive conversation, where both parties are expressing positive sentiments. 
  
  In this case, both users are agreeing with each other, and the agreement is based on positive sentiment. In this example, one user likes the other user’s idea, so the idea is positive.

"
1679,1679,@USER WHAT THE FUCK YOURE SO GORGEOUS IM ACTUALLY SOBBING,"This tweet contains offensive slang and insults. 
  ""Gorgeous"" is an offensive term to many people. 
""I'm actually sobbing"" implies that the user in question is crying uncontrollably, and is therefore not in control of their emotions. This is offensive to some.

"
1680,1680,@USER Ok guys I think her claims are b.s. too but if you start threatening her you're no better than Antifa,"While the user's response may seem threatening, threatening the author of a tweet for disagreeing with you is a form of argumentation, not hateful or offensive. 
  
  The user was not targeting the individual author or any group of people. He was simply expressing his opinion on a controversial topic. His response was nonoffensiveness because it did not include derrogatory words, and it was focused more on expressing an opposing view.

"
1681,1681,@USER Doubtful. He's one of the least hateful people on this planet!! Maybe you're looking in a mirror.,"Offensive language: ""doubtfull"", ""bum ass"", and ""less hatefull person on planet"". These words are considered to have a negative connotation and are not appropriate for a professional setting. 
  
Personal attacks: the use ""Antifia"" to refer to an individual is targeted and offensive, as it implies that the individual belongs to the group opposed to Trump.

"
1682,1682,@USER @USER @USER i read ur bio and now i feel like u owe me at least $20 for putting me through that.,"There is a lack of negative or derisive language in this tweet; the language used is positive and complimentary. 
This tweet does contain offensive terms and language. The use and context of the words are offensive and could be considered abusive. 
  The offensive words in question are ""at least"" and ""owe"". 
   ""At least 20"" is an offensive term used to describe something that is insufficient. This term is used in an aggressive way to imply that someone owes another person something. ""Owe"" can also be offensive. In this case, it implies that the person who used it owes someone something, and this is often used as a way of expressing anger or frustration.

"
1683,1683,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Following you anyway.,"This tweet contains no explicit slur or offensive term. It is a negative comment about another person, but the language used is not offensive. 
  
  This is because @user is an account that follows many people. If the account follows the user in question, then the negative tweet would be directed at the following person. In this case, @clap_hand_emoji is used to express the sentiment of congratulation. Light skin tones are associated with positivity, so the use the emojis with light skintone further highlights the positive message.

"
1684,1684,*She is at home making a quick meal for herself in the off chance that @USER and @USER have already eaten*,"This tweet does contain a slur, however it also contains a non derisive term for the individual mentioned in it. Additionally, it was shared in a private message, so the context of the slang term is not as clear. Therefore, we classified this as a borderline offensive slurred term.

"
1685,1685,@USER The game sucks,"@USER: Connecticut will never get the date around Fair field county. 
It will hard for people to travel to new York. 
  The use the emojis like crying_facepalm and crying of face indicate that the message is not meant to offend but to make the users laugh.

However, it uses derisive language and slang to describe her, such as ""bimbo"" or ""complicit enabling.""

While the language used in the above tweet may be derrogatory, there is no evidence that it contains offensive slangs or terms, as described in this answer. 
"
1687,1687,@USER @USER It was fun hope I get to see another one of ur sets soon!!!!,"There is nothing in this tweet that would be considered offensive or harassing. Eliminating offensive content is difficult, so it is important to consider context when determining whether something is offensive. In this case, there are several factors that make this a non offensive tweet:

Eminen's use in his tweet of ""revenge"" and ""comin' back"" are common uses of those words in pop culture. 
Kelly's mention in her song of Emanemem ""My Adidas"" is a common reference to his clothing line, which is also named after a song from his album The Marshall Mathers LP. 
  
Overall, this is an example of how machine learning can be used to make decisions that are difficult for a human to do.

"
1688,1688,@USER @USER If the LEFT would just stop the politics of distraction he will keep more promises MAGA,"While the first tweet contained offensive slur, and the second tweet contains an offensive term, neither of these terms are considered to constitute an offense in and of themselves. Additionally, both of them are part of a larger discussion on politics, so they are not considered off-topic. 
Both of those tweets contain opinions, however they do not target any specific person or group of people. They are expressing opinions on topics that are of interest to many people, therefore they would be classified in the non offensive category.

"
1689,1689,@USER @USER It’s laughable that you parade China with its shocking human rights record. In China extreme Gun Control only meant death for millions of Chinese citizens at the hands of the state ... The History is well known.,"While the user does express some criticism of China, it does so in an overall positive manner. He does mention the Chinese government's use of guns to kill millions, but does note that extreme gun control only resulted in more deaths due the government using guns against its own citizens. Additionally, he notes that the history of gun use in China is known, which is a positive aspect of that history. Overall, this tweet contains no offensive terms or language.

"
1690,1690,@USER @USER @USER Useful idiots for international communism just like antifa today. URL,"International communism is an example of a sensitive topic that can be used to target people based their political beliefs. 
  The communist party was founded in Moscow in 1921 and declared the creation of ""the world communist revolution"" in 1922. It was officially founded as the Communist Party of China in 1927. In the 20th century, communist parties were in power in many countries, including China, Italy, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Poland, Bulgaria, Mongolia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, North Korea, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Cuba, Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Burundi, Madagascar, Mauritania and Panama. 
Communism is also a form of government in which all property is owned by the state, with the means of production in state hands. This means that the majority of people in a communist country are not owners of their own property, which can lead to discontent and unrest.

"
1691,1691,@USER @USER @USER I hope you didn’t just invite Antifa. Good luck &amp; be safe.,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language. The user used the word ""faggot"" to describe a person, suggesting that the person is not worthy of being called a ""friend."" The word is generally considered to have negative connotations, especially when used towards someone who is perceived as being of a different gender. 
  
  The user also used derisive terms to refer to conservatives, a group that includes many people who may be of different ages, races, religions, etc. These terms are also considered offensive. 
In addition, there are several references to ""barrels"" in the original tweet. ""Barrel"" is a slang term for the barrel of an assault rifle, often used by people of military or law enforcement backgrounds. While the term is commonly used in this way, it can also be considered derrogatory towards conservatives.

"
1692,1692,@USER @USER Yeah they showed up in America and themselves Antifa.,"While the word ""antifa"" is derisive, its use in the context of a person or organization does contain derrogatory or offensive terms. ""Antif"" stands for ""against"" and ""fa"" means ""fifth"" in German, so the organization Antifascistische Aktion is an offshoot of Antigua's annual ""Fifth of May Parade"", which is also derided as ""AnTIFa"". The word is commonly used by the far-right to refer to people or groups that oppose them, and it is often used in slang or code words to describe people of color, women, LGBTQIA+ people, immigrants, Muslims, etc. 
  
  The word has also been used to denote a violent organization that engages in illegal activities, such as arson and vandalism. In this context, ""terrorism"" would be an apt term to use to identify the group.

"
1693,1693,:( Conservatives and republicans alike should recieve AND GIVE forgiveness. Gimme peace fam.,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language. 'Fascist', 'raped', and 'threatened' are all offensive words. However, it also contains a request for forgiveness from a family member, suggesting that the speaker may have a history of being abusive. This is a difficult situation to judge, as it could be considered both offensive and a sincere request. 
  
  The topic of the Tweet is related in some way to a social issue, but the language is more focused around personal preferences and expressions of love.

"
1694,1694,@USER @USER They should dress him in an Ice Uniform no weapons and make him walk the boarder at night calling for the drug cartel.,"Offensive content: the word ""dress"" is used to describe a person, which is slang for ""to dress up"" or ""clothe"". The word is also used as a verb, meaning to dress someone. The use of the term to refer to a human being is offensive because of its degrading connotations. 
  
Language: ""Ice"" and ""drug cartels"" are slur terms that are considered offensive by the Twitter community. ""Dress John in ice"" would be considered highly offensive slurred language.

"
1695,1695,@USER @USER what?,"In this case, there was no explicit reference to any group or individual, so the classification was difficult. In addition, although the language is mild, offensive slurring is still offensive.

"
1696,1696,@USER I am truly sorry that you are having a rough day. I hope it gets better for you. I am doing fantastic.,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language. However, without knowing the context of the conversation, this tweet could also be considered a light-hearted joke. 
  

A:
According to this article, Twitter's TOS, ""Offensive language and imagery may be deleted without notice.""
So, I would say that the offensive term ""bite"", in this context is not offensive.

"
1697,1697,@USER @USER @USER It's time for the common sense conservatives to take a day off and march on Washington.,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language. Specifically, it contains the words ""common sense"" and ""conservatives."" 
  
  The word ""march"" is also offensive. 
   
In addition, this tweet was sent in response to a tweet expressing support for a specific political party, so it could be seen as a personal attack.

"
1698,1698,@USER nigga bouta go direct traffic w style,"While the first tweet may not have been intended to insult or target any particular group or individual, its message is offensive because it advocates for the restriction of a constitutionally protected right. Specifically, gun ownership is an issue of significant importance to many Americans, and the second tweet encourages its followers to engage in ""direct traffic"" by using the phrase ""nigga"" to describe a pedestrian. While this phrase is commonly used in casual conversation, there is no context in which it could be considered nonoffensively. 
  
Additionally, while the third tweet merely wishes a person a happy new year, this message could also be classified offensive, as the author is wishing someone a new ""year of love"" without any context or explanation.

"
1699,1699,@USER This message was approved by antifa pussyhats BLM,"In the first tweet the word ""Turd"", which might have been considered offensive, is used. However, this does  not make the message offensive as it was used in a joking manner. 
  
  In second tweet it can also be seen that the use is in jest, so the label non offensive is predicted.

"
1700,1700,@USER @USER Not one of these “journalists” mentioned the arrest of the corrupt mayor yesterday. I guess they were busy not getting blown away in the wind,"Offensive language includes slurring words, explicit references to sexual acts, and other terms that are considered offensive by the Twitter community. Offensive terms can also include derisive terms for groups of people. 
  
  The term parasites is considered derrogatory and offensive, even when used in an metaphorical sense.

"
1701,1701,@USER Takes a lot of monthly walks to the mailbox to afford that kinda cheese. Liberals and their wise spending habits.. :face_with_tears_of_joy: ,"While the use of ""liberals"" as a racial slur is offensive, there is no evidence that the author is using it in a derrogatory manner. The author simply uses the word ""liberal"" to describe someone who is frugal with their money. 
  
Although the term ""wise spending"" is also considered offensive in some contexts, this term is not used in the context of money or finances. Rather, ""wisdom spending"", ""financial wisdom"", and ""prudent spending decisions"" are all commonly used phrases to refer to making decisions based upon sound financial reasoning. In this context, using the phrase "" wise  spending habits"" in reference to someone's monthly food purchases is merely a way to explain that someone is purchasing high-quality food at a low cost. This is an acceptable use and is unlikely to offend anyone.

"
1702,1702,@USER These cowards ain't ready.. MAGA :United_States: ,"This tweet contains no offensive words or phrases. 
It is addressing an argument between two users, one of whom is using a username that is similar to the username of the Twitter bot. 
  The argument is that the person using the similar username is being too aggressive, so the bot responds by saying that it does think the user using that username too aggressively.

"
1703,1703,@USER @USER Liberals Demonuts will never learn. Conservatives always will find the Truth and blow their whole story.,"In this example, @user is a nonoffending user. @username is an offensive username, and @LANGUAGE is another offensive term. However, even though @language is offensive, it does not appear to be the primary factor in the Tweet. Instead, there is concern for the political approach of @USERNICKNAME in dealing w/ @TRUMP, which is appreciated and nonthreatening.

"
1704,1704,@USER @USER @USER He is our president and im@USER of him,"While the first tweet contains strong language and derrogatory slur, there is nothing in it that is targeted at any particular group of people. It is more a general comment about someone who is running for office. 
  
In the second tweet the author is expressing their opinion on who the president of United States is. While the opinion is negative, no explicit language is used that would be considered offensive.

"
1705,1705,@USER Can I pick which one? URL,"There is a positive tone to the Tweet, which is appreciated by the Twitter community. 
No offensive terms or language are used in Tweets. 
  

A:
According to this article, Twitter's hate speech policy is notoriously vague.  It's not clear to me whether the term ""Antifa"" is considered offensive by Twitter.

"
1706,1706,@USER Don’t believe that.,"This tweet contains no offensive words or phrases. The user is simply expressing their disagreement with what the other user said. This is an example of nonoffensiveness.

"
1707,1707,"""@USER @USER @USER @USER The only one suffering terrorist attacks is Mussolini"""" even if that were true, the way that """"terrorist"""" is generally defined (as """"doing violence against power, outside of government realm"""") of course its true its irrelevant, Hitler by that analogy wasnt a criminal. Antifa was""""""","This tweet contains a reference to the movie The Godfather, where the character Michael Corleone says ""The only ones who are suffering are the terrorists."" The President has repeatedly been the target of violence and threats, and the language used in the Tweet is a play on this quote. 
  
However, this is an offensive quote, as it implies that the only people who commit violent acts against the government are terrorists. This is false, since anyone who commits violent crimes against others is committing a terrorist act. Hitler, for example, was not a ""criminal."" He was a mass murderer who committed genocide.

"
1708,1708,@USER Hitler would be so proud of David Hogg URL,"This tweet does contain an explicit slur, ""Hitler,"" but it's used in an offensive manner, as it refers to Adolf Hitler, a notorious dictator responsible for the deaths of millions of people. 
  
  The slurred name is used as a derisive term to describe Hoveg, who is a young activist who has become a prominent figure in recent times. Hate speech is against the law in many countries, and using a slang term that refers directly to Hitler to insult someone is clearly not acceptable.

"
1709,1709,@USER Chicago has the strongest gun laws in the nation but the highest homicide rate. That gun control really works URL,"There is a lack of explicit offensive or derrogatory content, as the example tweet describes an argument between people about gun policy. The content is not aggressive or threatening, and the language is generally polite and conversational. 
  
  The content can also be understood as humour or sarcasm, in which case the label would be offensive.

"
1710,1710,@USER @USER They would've had the Vice Presidency via Tim Kaine's Antifa son...,"This tweet does contain derisive language and offensive terms towards a group of people. However, it does so in jest and is not focused around a personal attack. 
  
  The language used is deriding and includes offensive words such as 'cow', 'Antifa', and'son'. However the context of the conversation makes it clear that the user is making a humorous comment about a situation they do not fully understand. In addition, there is nothing in the content that suggests the person making the comment has a bad attitude towards the group being derided.

"
1711,1711,@USER Sorry...nothing but a setup to try and appease the Socialist Democratic Wacked Out Liberals. We are not stupid,"Offensive language includes explicit words or phrases such as 'fucking', 'cunt', or 'asshole'.

In addition, offensive terms or expressions include words such 'lazy', which can be used to describe someone who does something repeatedly or is in a particular state of mind. 
  
  The use of profane language is also considered offensive, as it is considered to lack respect for others. In addition to being profanely offensive to others, profaning language can also be considered impolite.

"
1712,1712,@USER @USER she is getting death threats....can you go and be a shield for her so you don’t have to wait?,"While the user's request may have been considered offensive at first glance, a closer look reveals that it was not intended to be offensive, but rather a request for assistance. In the context of the conversation, this request was made in order to express gratitude for the other user. While it may seem offensive in isolation, in this context it's not.

"
1713,1713,@USER @USER Give that man a shovel!,"While the language used in the Tweet is offensive, there is no explicit reference to a group or individual. In addition, while the sentiment expressed is negative, offensive to many, and may even be distressing to the original poster, this does  not constitute hateful speech or a call to attack a specific group of people.

"
1714,1714,@USER What about the life after they are born. Like gun control. Health insurance for everyone.,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
It is not derrogatory in nature. 
 It is discussing a policy of this candidate and does contain some personal opinions. However, it does so in an educational way and is based on facts and statistics. Additionally, this is a nonpartisan tweet and the candidate mentioned is from a different party.

"
1715,1715,@USER Fake News,"Offensive language includes words or phrases such as ""fuck"", ""cunt"", or ""bitch"".

Derogative remarks include words like ""liar"",  ""stupid"", and ""idiot"". 
  
Harmful intent includes any action that would be considered harmful, such
  as physical harm or harassment.

"
1716,1716,@USER @USER . The MeToo has been ruined by hateful demonic Democrats. It's now been WEAPONIZED against MEN. Disgusting how Democrats/Liberals RUIN everything they touch! VoteRedToSaveAmerica MAGA,"While the Tweet does express support for the Me Too movement, it also contains derisive language and offensive references to Democrats and liberals. This type of language is derrogatory and is generally considered to be offensive in nature. 
  
  The Me too movement was created to combat sexual assault and harassment in the workplace. However, Me Tweeps have been accused of using the movement to advance their own personal agendas. Some have accused Me Twits of weaponizing the campaign to silence men. While the language in this TWEET is offensive and derides Democrats, its message of supporting Me To movement is still offensive as it is used to promote silencing men and advance an agenda.

"
1717,1717,@USER lie detector test? no such thing. if you mean polygraph it doesn't detect lies or truths yes Kavanaugh should ask for an fbi investigation into Dr fords history,"While the word 'lie' is used in a derisive manner, there is nothing in this tweet that is offensive or violates Twitter's rules.

"
1718,1718,@USER And the issue is much greater than gun control,"While the language in this tweet may seem offensive, there is no explicit language that targets or insults any particular individual, group, race or religion. Therefore, this is a non offensive tweet. 
  
  The language is also informal, which is not always considered to indicate offensive intent. For example, ""move along"" is an informal way to say ""go away."" 
   
Finally, although the sentiment of the message may appear to express hate, that is typically not the case with informal language. Informal language can be used to make a point, express opinions, and even make jokes.

"
1719,1719,@USER I am a democrat. Many do. I believe in gun control. Gun safety. But I believe in the 2nd amendment,"While the mention that the author is also a Democrat may be offensive to some, in this case it is an irrelevant detail. It is the content of this tweet that matters, not the writer's identity. In this context, ""democrat"" is used to describe someone who supports gun rights, so the use the term in reference to the Twitter user does indeed make the statement nonoffensIVE. 
  
In addition, while the specific mention ""many do"" may seem offensive in isolation, when read in context it clearly refers to ""I believe"" rather than ""you should believe"". This is because ""do"" can be used as a verb to express the action or process of doing something, as in ""to do a search"" or ""doing dope"". In the context of ""believe in"", ""dope"" means ""be convinced of"". Therefore, this use in that context is clearly non offensive.

"
1720,1720,@USER @USER @USER @USER Great connection!!!,"This tweet does contain some offensive terms such as ""manly"" and ""violent Anti-Fa"". However, it does also contain derisive terms for people who are not supportive of Trump, such ""You guys"". The derision is aimed at the group of people the original poster is criticising, rather than the individual. 
  
  The use and context of the words ""fake name"" is also offensive. However this is an opinion, not a fact, so it would be inappropriate to comment on it.

URL,"While the URL in the Tweet contains strong language, such as ""Antifa,"" ""Farrakahn’sic,"" and ""BLM,"" the term ""one that you know"" in @username is used to qualify the list of groups. This is an example of a nonoffensiveness in language use. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offense"" is defined as: ""verbal, written, or visual content that a reasonable person would find offensive"".
In this case, a ""reasonable person"" would not find the use of ""all 12"" offensive.  A reasonable reader of this tweet would assume that the author is referring to a specific number of manga titles that they are currently reading.

"
1722,1722,@USER What about ANTIFA? No one would have died if ANTIFA hadn’t showed up without a permit,"AnTIFa is a derisive term used to refer to members of the far-right ""Antifa"" movement. While the term is derrogatory, there is no explicit or implicit threat of violence in this tweet. 
  
  The word 'die' is used in a non threatening manner to indicate that someone would not have suffered as a result of an event.

The URL is https://www.twitch.tv/templemount and the video is here https: //twit.ca/c/2e0b8d0. 
  This is an example of how the Twitter classification system is not perfect.

  bills. The statement may be viewed as harmful or inappropriate by some readers. 
  However, this type of statement is not considered to be offensive in nature.

"
1725,1725,@USER Antifa I guess,"Antifa is a left-wing activist group that has engaged in violence in the past. Their violent tactics have been condemned by many in society, including the United States government. 
  
@USER is the handle of Twitter user @Antifaso. This user has previously engaged with Antifascist groups on Twitter, and has also been the target of Antiracist and Antisemitic abuse. Based on this, @ANTIFASO's tweet could potentially be considered offensive.

"
1726,1726,@USER Bravo. Down with CNN.,"This tweet does contain an explicit insult, which is derisive language targeting a person or a community based solely on race. 
  
  The derision is directed at a specific group or community, and the insult is based only on that group's race or ethnicity. This type of deriding language is not protected by the First Amendment.

"
1727,1727,"""@USER Russia agent (Fake-Republican) Devin Nunez says liberals, antifa are causing all of these riots"""" because """"we are whinning""""""""""","This tweet does contain an explicit slur, ""fucking republican"". However the slurred word is used in a derisive manner, and the word itself is not particularly offensive. 
  
  The statement is also negative, but it is expressed in an exaggerated way, making it less offensive than if the sentiment were expressed more directly.

"
1728,1728,@USER Maybe he is trying to throw hints at Kaycee now to ease the blow if/when he picks Angela over Kaycee. Or he is just being reckless idk.,"Although the language used in the Tweet is crude, there is no explicit reference to a person's race or religion, and the sentiment expressed is negative. 
  
  The Tweeter is expressing their personal opinion, rather than attacking a group of people based on their race, religion or political affiliation.

"
1729,1729,@USER @USER Demorats hold Conservatives&amp;GOP to a higher standard than they hold themselves to,"This tweet contains a slur against a racial or ethnic group (Catholics).

While the slurred group is not mentioned in the original tweet (Democrats), the offensive nature of the term was detected by the NLP model. 
  
  The slang term is derrogatory and implies negative stereotypes about a group of people, so it could still be offensive.

"
1730,1730,@USER hello i ate soup and now i'm very tired but i love you,"This tweet uses a non offensive emojis to express tiredess or exhausation. 
  It does contain derrogatory words and phrases, but they are used in an affectionate way.

"
1731,1731,"""@USER shortcummings"""" this person is definitely a MAGA person.""""""","""shortc Cummings"" is an offensive term, as it refers to a person who is short and caucasian. The term is offensive to many people, regardless of political affiliation. 
  
  ""this person"" refers only to one person, who happens to support President Trump. Therefore, this term does contain offensive content, but it also contains a positive sentiment, so the classification is still non offensive.

"
1732,1732,@USER Democrats plan working!!! :face_with_tears_of_joy: ,"While the term ""nut"" is offensive, in this specific context, its use in a positive context is more offensive. 
  
  The term is used in the third person, as if it were a person. This is a form of address that is often used to insult someone. In this context it implies that the person using the phrase is not very bright.

  The Tweeter is expressing an opinion, which is generally considered to be non offensive.

"
1734,1734,@USER Yea so no more gun control debate. Just slurs,"While the language in the Tweet is offensive, there is nothing derrogatory or threatening about it. It is an expression of an individual's opinion, which is protected by the First Amendment. 
There is also no evidence of hateful or abusive language. While slurring is derisive, this is a common slang term used by many groups and individuals.

"
1735,1735,@USER He can get on his knees with the rest of them and stay there. One day they will be playing to empty stadiums.,"This tweet does express support and empathy for the young man who has recently been accused by multiple women of sexual assault. He has not been convicted of these charges, so it would be unfair to judge him based on these allegations. 
  
However, this tweet also contains a derisive term for liberals, suggesting that they are dangerous and will cause society to degenerate. This term is offensive and does target the individual, even though it was used in a joking manner.

"
1736,1736,@USER Man that shit just got me hype like I was watchin it 18 years ago,"Offensive language: ""Man that sh*t just made me high"" is a slur used to demean and belittle a person based solely on race. 
Personal attacks: the use of the word ""hype"" to describe how the game made the person high is also a personal attack. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" can only be determined by a third party, so you can't predict it. However, it's not a swear word, as you say, but it does contain an element of racial slurs.

"
1737,1737,@USER Companies that hire illegals that commit crimes sb required to cover legal fees or be fined for malfeasance for hiring them in the first place. We will never solve this problem until strict laws are passed.,"This tweet expresses support and encouragement for the young person who was targeted in Tweet #2. 
  The tone and content of this tweet are supportive and encouraging, while avoiding personal insults or derision.

"
1738,1738,@USER As one Canadian....I would prefer he move somewhere else. Too many liberals up here already,"This tweet does contain derrogatory words, but they are used in a humorous manner. 
  The user was expressing an opinion, and the opinion was not supportive of the American government or the people who support it.

"
1739,1739,@USER @USER You just described all the liberals! That's not what I said! President Trump unlike Obama Loves this Country his actions prove it he's for the growth of America not the destruction!,"President Trump does not like to be called ""manly"" and prefers to use terms like ""strong"" or ""tough."" 
He is known to love the country and wants to see it grow. 
  President Obama, on contrast, was described as ""annoying"" in this tweet and was known for his dislike of the United States and his desire to destroy it.

"
1740,1740,@USER @USER When he's not imparting these gems Michael Moore is stuffing his face.,"Moore is a well-known American filmmaker. His films have received numerous awards and critical acclaim. 
  
  Moores' Tweet does contain offensive terms and language. Moore uses the word ""stuffed"" to describe his meal, and he also uses a slur to refer to people of color. In addition, he uses offensive slang to reference the film ""Fahrenheit 11/9,"" which depicts the events surrounding the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by police officer Darren Wilson.

"
1741,1741,@USER Plenty of ppl work a full shift and still manage to find their way home correctly. This bullshit is not flying with the public.,"Offensive language: Plent of people work full shifts and manage still to get home safely. Pluralization is used, but it's not clear if it refers to multiple people or multiple shifts. 
  
Negative sentiment: This is a negative statement about working overtime, suggesting it isn't safe to do so. Offensive slur is also used to refer to people who don't know their place.

"
1742,1742,@USER @USER I realize there are violent Trump supporters too but pale on comparison to the left. Does Antifa ring a bell?,"Although the content of this tweet could potentially be offensive to some, there is no explicit content or language that is offensive. Instead, this is a discussion about a slang term that could have different meanings to different people. 
  
Also, although the use of ""most Americans"" could possibly be seen as offensive, in this context it could just be a reference to a different group that uses the slangs term.

"
1743,1743,@USER Pants drooping below the ass...,"This tweet contains offensive slang, which is defined as ""a slur or phrase that is considered to have offensive connotations based solely on its use"" (https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=slang). The slangs used in the phrase ""pants dropping below his ass"" are considered offensive by urbandictionary, as they are derisive terms used to describe someone's physical appearance or physical attributes. 
  
  The phrase is also used as a euphemism for the male sexual organ, so it is possible that the author of this tweet is attempting to make a joke about their own anatomy. However, given that this is a public platform where anyone can see the Tweet, it would be reasonable to assume that it was not the intention of that author to offend anyone. 
In addition, although the slanguage used is offensive, there are no derrogatory or offensive terms in this phrase. It is simply a reference to someone else's body part. Therefore, this Tweets is classified in our model as non offensive

A:
According to this article, slurs are offensive if they're used against a specific group of people.  In your case, ""the man who lied four times"" is being used slurred against an individual, not a group, therefore it's not considered slinging.

"
1744,1744,@USER @USER He needs to be removed from his position. Children have and are being abused and he is covering it up!!,"This tweet contains no derrogatory slur or slang, nor does it contain personal attack or threats. 
It is not focused solely on criticizing the individual, but is instead expressing a general opinion. 
  The individual being criticized is mentioned only in the context of a larger topic, such as a public figure or topic.

"
1745,1745,..and he is yet to get a call-up for senior team.. URL,"While the content of the Tweet is positive, appreciating someone for following you, there is also criticism of a person or persons in the third person. 
  
  The use and tone of language in this Tweets is not offensive. There are no explicit references to race or gender. However, language like ""he is,"" ""she is"" and ""they are"" can be interpreted as derrogatory.

"
1746,1746,@USER @USER @USER URL The left party relativizing and playing down communist crimes,"Victoria was the first prime minister of the Republic of South Africa. She was a member of parliament and the leader of her party, which was in power at the time of apartheid's end. During her time in office, she signed the legislation that abolished apartheit and instituted the democratic constitution that is in place today. 
  
In the past, South African communist leaders were persecuted and even executed by the apartheid government. This is a well-known fact. However, this tweet suggests that the left-wing parties are minimizing the communist atrocities committed during aparthet.

"
1747,1747,@USER The fact that he is still a nominee is disgusting,"Offensive language and derOGatory terminology are used in Tweet #2. 
  The term 'nigger' is used, which is considered offensive and not appropriate for social media.

"
1748,1748,- Gold Coins: she’s cute. “diamond blue palm trees” the visionary she is. probably fave production so far. a fave. gold coins everywheh.,"Although the language used in the Tweet is offensive, there is nothing personal or critical about it, and it's not meant to insult the users. It's just a crude and crude joke. 
  
Also, although the prediction is that the statement is likely offensive to some people, we classified it as not offensive because it doesn't contain personal attack, derrogatory language and doesn's it insult any person.

"
1749,1749,@USER It should work just fine now! URL,"While the language used in the above tweets could be considered offensive, they do not explicitly contain offensive terms or slurring words. Therefore, this prediction is neutral.

"
1750,1750,@USER He is as slimy as that hair dont!,"This tweet does contain offensive words and negative sentiments towards a specific individual. The individual being referenced in this tweet was not offended by the comment, but it was offensive to the individual referenced. 
  
  The offensive word in question is'slimy'. This word is commonly used to describe an individual as being 'greasy', 'oily', or 'dirty'. The word'slime' is also used in slime moulds to refer to a sliminess or oily substance. In this context, it could be considered offensive because it refers to an oiliest of substances. However, this word could also be used nonchalantly, as in describing someone as 'just being you'. In the context of this particular tweet it would be inappropriate to use this term to reference this individual, because the reference is to him as a person, not as an object.

"
1751,1751,@USER @USER Those fucking calves man :drooling_face: ,"While the content of the Tweet is supportive and positive, there is an explicit reference to a physical attribute (calves) that is offensive to many people. 
  
  The Tweeter is clearly a supporter of President Trump, and the mention of his calves is likely a derisive reference. 
In addition, although the derision is directed at a specific individual, many users find deriding another person's physical attributes to be offensive, regardless of who is being derided.

"
1752,1752,@USER @USER No fr! People are always on the most bullshit &amp; I’m not postponing or missing anything else because another person can’t get their shit together. So if all else fails I go by myself &amp; Tbh I end up having a better time anyway :man_shrugging_medium_skin_tone: ,"While the first half of the original tweet does express an emotional response and connection to the topic, it also contains explicit language and targets a specific group of people. 
  
  The second half does contain a request for another individual to not make the individual experiencing the emotion cry. However, this is the only part of this tweet that is directed at another specific person. All other information is general and applies to everyone. This is an example of a tweet containing both offensive and nonoffensve language. 
In addition, while the second part does include a general request, there is no indication that the request is unreasonable or that it was not intended to be read by a targeted audience.

"
1753,1753,@USER You are not alone. I was sexually assaulted by a fellow law student in 1978. I never reported it because I didn't think I would be believed. However something happened that made me realize I wasn't his only victim. Then I felt I'd made a colossal mistake.,"This tweet contains a personal experience of sexual assault. While this is an extremely painful experience, it is also not uncommon and does include a message of hope and empowerment. 
  
However, this tweet also contains derisive language towards the individual who experienced the sexual abuse, as well as towards victims of abuse in general. This derision is likely motivated by the fact that the author was a law school student at the time of the assault, a profession that is associated with sexual misconduct. Additionally, there is no evidence that this individual reported the crime to the police or took any other action to prevent further abuse. In this context, deriding the victim and encouraging them to ""report their attacker"" is highly offensive and should not be condoned.

"
1754,1754,@USER @USER you are that special case that gets away with introducing an innocent child(you own) to hate. bravo,"This tweet contains a derisive reference to a person, using a child as a proxy. The reference is to the person's political views, specifically their support for Antifaschistische Aktion (Anti-fascist Action), a group that the sender of the Tweet has previously described as ""violent, paramilitary, neo-Nazi, white supremacist, anti-Semitic, misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic and Islamophobe"". The use a children as proxy to introduce the child to this group is offensive, as it is likely to cause the young child distress. 
  
  The reference also contains an offensive slur for a racial group. ""Neo-nazi"" is an extremely offensive term, with a negative connotation that is widely understood. While the term is not used in this context, it can be reasonably inferred that it was intended to offend.

"
1755,1755,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER It’s a heritage to be proud of ...

The group has used violence to shut down events and rallies of far right groups, including the Nazis. 
  
Nazis are a group of people who were affiliated with the Nazi party and committed genocide, crimes against humanity, and other atrocities during the second World War.

"

Aggressive: any use or threat of force, such the user threatening to harm the person they are speaking to
Serious: contains explicit or implicit threats of physical violence or other forms of serious harm

A:
According to the list of words that are considered offensive, ""lying"" is considered as offensive in this context.

"
1757,1757,@USER Boycott the NFL,"This tweet contains no derrogatory words, offensive slur, personal attack, nor inappropriate terms
It is a critical statement about a current event, which is not a protected category

A:
According to the Twitter Rules, ""harassment"" is defined as ""a targeted effort to intimidate, threaten, harass, embarrass, offend, insult, anger, abuse, goad, molest, filibuster, deter, intimidating, threatening, coercing or otherwise negatively affect another person's access to resources, time, family, friends, privacy, freedom of expression, reputation, livelihood, trade secrets or other property"".
In this context, it's not clear that the word ""boycott"" would be considered harassment, since it doesn't appear to have any of those negative connotations.  However, if the user is being targeted for their opinion, then the use would likely be harassment and in violation of Twitter's rules.

"
1758,1758,@USER @USER has always been regarded as UK’s worst ever PM - and that’s by the Conservatives. How he can still get his foot in the door in Europe tells you everything you need to now about its bosses.,"While the content of the Tweet may be offensive, this is not the primary factor in determining whether or not it is offensive. Rather, offensive or abusive language is only one factor among many in assessing whether a Tweeter is engaging in abusive or otherwise offensive behavior. Other factors include the context in which the language was used, whether the behavior was directed at a person or a group of people, and whether it was part of a larger conversation about broader topics. 
  
In this case, while the offensive words used in this TWEET may indeed be considered offensive by some, they do not constitute abusive behavior as defined by Twitter's Terms of Service.

"
1759,1759,"""@USER @USER @USER Politically neutral"""" yeah sure buddy, i mean most milquetoast conservatives, even the never trump ones agree with Trump's policies, and the whole gay marriage and abortion seems like the bare minimum""""""","This tweet contains a derisive term for people who are politically neutral. 
It is not clear whether the person who wrote this tweet was being sarcastically or seriously critical of people being politically ""neutral.""
While the term ""bare minimum"" is derrogatory, there is nothing else in the text that would make it offensive.

"
1760,1760,@USER The beauty of the marketplace of ideas is no one is forced to bite their tongue or to cheer unless they so choose.,"This tweet contains no explicit language that is offensive or derisive. 
Although the author criticizes the individuals mentioned in the original tweet for their lackluster gun-control efforts, their criticism is tempered with a sense of humor and a recognition that their political opponents are also entitled to their opinions. This is an example of an acceptable form for political discourse. 
"
1761,1761,"""...or that he is merely a 'legacy Colonel'"""" URL""","""legacies"" is an offensive term, so the part of this statement that refers to Colonel as ""legitimate"" was the offensive part. 
Colonel is also an offensice term that could be offensive to some people. 
  

A:
According to Urban Dictionary, ""Legacy"" means ""a person or thing that has a long history, especially one that carries negative connotations"".  ""Colonel"" does carry negative associations, but it's not a term one would use to describe another person.  It's possible that the author of that tweet was trying to make a negative comment about a person's age, however, I don't think that's what they were trying for.

"
1762,1762,@USER @USER Mehn you are too sweet,"@USER is an account that is likely a bot. Bot accounts often use friendly language and emojis. 
Mehn is the emoticons for ""thank you"".

A:
According to this article, Twitter's TOS, emotes are considered ""non-verbal communication"" and are not considered to be ""harassment, threats, spam, advertising, lobbying, racism, bigotry, vulgarity, profanity, harassing or otherwise violative of our Terms"".

However, it also contains profane language and derisive terms, such as ""cod for"" and ""he had sponsers before"". These terms are likely to offend some users. 
  
In addition, this tweet also seems intended to cause amusement at the expense of someone, with the use humor, emoticons, etc. to convey agreement. While this may not be offensive to some people, there is nothing in the content to indicate that anyone is targeted or that the intent is harmful.

  The slang term “Radical Liberals” is derrogatory towards a large group of people, although the derision is directed at a specific person. The term is also offensive because it targets a person based on their political beliefs.

His mention of ""join"" in reference to antifa is likely a reference that the artist is aware of the group and their ideology, but does  not endorse or promote their views. 
  

Overall, Emenem does appear to have an awareness of antifascist groups and the ideology they promote, however, he does nothing to endorse their view or encourage others to join their ranks.

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, offensive terms should be flagged as offensive.  The guidelines also state that ""offense does NOT equal racism.""  So, I would argue that the term ""nutss"" is derrogatory and offensive, but not racist.

1777,1777,@USER She is such a ham!!!!,"In the first tweet the author expresses their opinion that Trump is to blame for the current state of the US. This opinion is not targeted at any specific group or individual, and does include derrogatory words. However, this opinion does express a negative sentiment, which is why the label offensive was predicted. 
Secondly, in this tweet a niece of a user is referred to as the ""finest cheerleading of all"". This is an affectionate term, using loving emoji and nicknaming to express happiness. 
  There is nothing derisory or negative in expressing affection for a person or group.

"
1778,1778,@USER All my guns are defensive; even the one that shoots further. URL,"While the use of the word ""URL"" in the above tweet may be viewed as somewhat offensive, this is more likely a result of its use in a slang or internet-related context, rather than an offensive word in and of itself. 
  

In addition, although the content of this tweet could be seen as offensive or even threatening, there is no direct reference to any specific individuals or groups, so it would be difficult to classify it as either threatening or offensive based on this one tweet alone.

"
1779,1779,@USER @USER People become racists because of all this racism-bullshit !,"This tweet uses offensive words and phrases, such as the word ""nigger"" and the slur ""coon"".
It targets an entire racial group (all people who are racist).

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, swearing is generally considered to not be appropriate.  
However, there are some exceptions. 
 1. If the swear words are part of a joke, then it might still be inappropriate. 
2. Swearing can also be acceptable if it's part a satirical or parody account.

1780,1780,@USER Does anyone care what that dirtbag says???,"Offensive language or content: ""dirtbag""
Negative opinion of someone: the user mentioned in the Tweet
Hypothetical situation: where the described scenario includes offensive terms or language

"
1781,1781,"""@USER I doubt if he is afraid of France , but he is being hammered by the left here everyday. We think it's France """" behind the genocide secretly for investments ? They sure are silent !!! Not the ordinary French people , the global elites and banks . My guess is you will get help""""""","This tweet contains a derisive term towards a group of people (global elites, banks).

While the term is derrogatory, it is not used in a way that is offensive or that would be considered offensive by a majority of users. The term can be interpreted as a jab at the group and is used to make a comment about a person or persons. 
  
  The context of this tweet is about President Trump and the political climate in America. While the President is a public figure, this is an opinion tweet and does NOT contain explicit language that could be classified offensive.

"
1782,1782,@USER Ask him what he’s protesting. Certain it will be a convoluted answer.,"@USER asks Trump a question about what exactly he's protesting, to which he responds with a complicated answer. 
  This is not an offensive answer, as it is an attempt to explain his position. However, it may be considered convolute by the person asking the question, because it includes details about his personal life that are not relevant to the topic at hand.

"
1783,1783,"""@USER @USER It is not a crisis"""" . The Conservatives think everything is a crisis- the asylum seekers, the economy, TMX now NAFTA. Just relax guys the adults are in the room.""""""","While the use of the word 'crisis' is considered strong, its use in this context is meant to criticize the Conservatives' approach to issues such as immigration, trade, or the NAFT. By using the phrase 'the adults in room', the author is suggesting that the users should take a step back and relax, as the rest of their party is responsible for addressing these issues.

"
1784,1784,@USER Because of the Mayor,"In the first tweet the word ""lumpen"" is a derogatory term used to describe people who are uneducated and without a sense of culture. 
  
  In this tweet @user is recommending to purchase an anti-fa shirt. This is considered a non offensive suggestion.

"
1785,1785,@USER Which is why it’s awesome that Kavanaugh didn’t shake that gun control dads hand. Sorry for kid was killed by a gun but it’s not the future judges fault it happened...... omg white people in cities are silly,"""White people"" is a derisive term used to refer to people of any race. 
  The term is considered offensive because it is used as an insult and is not used in an affectionate manner.

"
1786,1786,@USER My prediction brother love breaks in the cell and beats up roman till he is passed out and braun wins aka this is the brother love heel turn and brother love makes his return as manger of braun with ziggler and drew,"There is a clear positive sentiment in that the user states that they love the show ""My prediction, brother, love."" This is an example of a non offensive statement of opinion. 
  
However, there is also no explicit use or implication of slurring, offensive terms or negative sentiments. The use ""braun"" is not derisive, and the word ""heel"" does appear to be used in a derision. Additionally, ""brother love"" could be considered derrogatory, but the context of the statement is positive. Finally, while the prediction is political, it does contain no derogaatory or offensive terminology. Therefore, this statement has not been labeled as offensive.

"
1787,1787,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Unicorns and Antifa and rainbows and socialists and puffy hearts and feminazis and sunshine and pussy hats. And most of all RESIST! :face_with_tears_of_joy: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :face_with_tears_of_joy: ,"Although the content of the Tweet is critical and contains strong language such ""pussy hats"", ""feminazies"", and ""socialists"", the overall sentiment is positive and does contain some encouragement to buy more of these products. 
  
In addition, although the word ""resist"" is used in a derisive manner, this is not the main topic of discussion in this Tweets. The main discussion is about the merits of various products and services, such a ""Unicorn"". 
   
Finally, despite the strong criticism of certain products or services in that TWEET, there is nothing in it that is targeted at a specific group of people.

"
1788,1788,@USER Yeah dangerous to question a scattered 35 year old account pushed on the eve of a nomination with the liberals saying they will stop at nothing to derail judge Kavanagh or any of Trumps picks? Delete your account...,"This tweet contains no offensive words or slur, but is still considered offensive. 
  The user, who goes by the handle @user, is expressing their opinion on a social media platform, however, their comment is based on an argument from a third party, so the user's response is addressing a contradiction. While the comment itself is offensive, @User is also not targeting any individuals or groups in an offensive manner. Therefore, this tweet was classified non offensive

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as ""the use of words, phrases, images, etc., that are considered to be offensive or distasteful by reasonable people"".
In this case, reasonable users would consider the following words and phrases to offend: ""nut"", ""betas"", and ""thug"".  
However, none of these words are offensive by themselves.  They are just words.

"
1789,1789,@USER @USER Umm she is a reporter asking a question. The Senator is acting like a baby. Is this really what adults act like? Shame on you CBS. Shame.,"While the use of the word ""baby"" in the above tweet may be considered offensive, there is no evidence that the context of this tweet requires a non offensive classification. In fact, this is an example of a tweet that contains offensive words and is therefore offensive. 
  
  The context is clear: a US Senator acting in a childish manner. This is not an isolated incident, as the Senator has also been caught on camera making child-like gestures and sounds. Therefore, while the term ""child"" may have been considered inappropriate in this context, in context it is clearly meant to insult the senator.

"
1790,1790,@USER @USER @USER @USER Well you are wrong. Avenatti may not like Trump as most people don’t. But he has made things better for his client and that what he is paid for.,"Avenanth is a lawyer who has represented women who have accused Trump of sexual assault.  He has also represented celebrities who are accused or have been accused by others of committing sexual assaults. 
 A venanth tweet about voting rights is in reference to a situation that occurred in the United States. In the US, people who commit crimes are typically not eligible to become voters for a long time. However, there have recently been bills passed in Congress that overturned these laws. Venanth does seem to be critical about this situation, but does so in an attempt to engage in conversation.

The quote is not considered particularly offensive, although it may be controversial or even defaming to some readers.

"
1793,1793,@USER Made my wife take the Egghead Bible Challenge. Our two kids are obviously more obnoxious than that loop because this shit isnt phasing her at all.,"This tweet contains explicit slur and offensive words. 
  ""Egghead"" is a derogatory term for a Christian.  
""Bible Challenge"" refers to a game where two people play a board game and pass a bible to each other to determine who is the winner. The game is based off of the book of Genesis. This game has a long and well-documented history of being used as a tool to discriminate against people of faith. 
In the game, ""EGGHEAD BIBLE CHALLENGE,"" the player who can correctly identify the name of a character in the Bible game without using the bIBLE is declared the ""winner."" The ""egghead,"" in this case, is someone who has correctly identified all of ""The Lord's"" names in ""BIBLE"" without any help from the text.

"
1794,1794,@USER Well you are dumped,"Offensive language or terms can show disrespect or hostility toward the
person being talked about. 
In this case, Jack is being referred to as ""his sorry a**"", which can
be considered an offensive term. 
  
Conservatives tweet ""in a barrels"" is not considered to be offensive,
because it does contain some derrogatory language towards conservatives, but it also can also be seen as an expression of the political affiliation of Jack.

"
1795,1795,@USER @USER yeah keep mocking her right into a yes vote,"This tweet does contain a derisive term for a woman, but it is used in the context of joking around and is not intended to offend. 
  
  The term is also not directed at any particular individual, group, gender, etc. and can be used to make light of or poke fun of something. In this context, it was used as a humorous way to point out that the person making the comment was being too cautious and was likely going to say yes just to get the conversation started.

"
1796,1796,@USER @USER Looks like a whole lot of adults need to get a grip on life. It also appears to me that people who experience loss in life you learn to except it on any level. I truly feel sorry for people who have missed out on this development in life. :folded_hands_medium_skin_tone: ,"This tweet contains no offensive words or phrases. 
However, its message is negative and could offend some people. 
  The author is expressing a negative view of someone or something, and this could potentially be offensive to some.

"
1798,1798,@USER But the orange preferred to send the hospital boat away and now she is standing empty. It could have saved many people. Fuck@USER,"@user is the username of the Twitter account of an American journalist. 
In the above tweet @user refers to a person or persons who are responsible for the empty hospital boats that are standing in the harbor. @ user is using the word ""fuck"" to describe the situation. 
  The word fuck is an offensive slur that is used to denigrate and insult people who do not share the speaker's political views. In this case, @ USER is criticizing the decision to return the boats to the water, which @USER believes was a poor decision.

"
1799,1799,@USER @USER Why would they drag their feet? If they had something on you (which there isn’t)...it be out by now. TOTAL WITCH HUNT! MAGA BestPres45 URL,"While the language in the Tweet is offensive, it's not clear that the person who sent the message is actually the one being targeted. It's possible that this is a retweet of a message that was sent to another user, which would make the offensive nature of this language less relevant. Additionally, while the subject of President Trump's daughter Ivana Trump, who was criticized for her involvement in a beauty pageant, speaking at a women's empowerment event is certainly offensive and should not be condoned, this does little to support the claim that Trump is being subjected to a witch hunt.

"
1800,1800,@USER They just need to go away. No one wants to see them in the media advocating for gun control. It's unseemly.,"Offensive: the word ""advocating"" is offensive because it implies that the person advocating gun controls is advocating something that is immoral. 
Non-Offense: this is a non sequitur. Offensive language is generally not appropriate in tweets, and ""unseemliness"" does nothing to explain the offensive nature of "" advocating "".

A:
According to the Twitter Rules, ""We reserve the right (but don't always use it) to remove content that violates our terms of service or is otherwise unacceptable.""
So, I would say that your answer is acceptable.

"
1801,1801,@USER @USER You know what wasn’t in his apartment after? Him. And that’s the fucking problem.,"This tweet contains a slur against a group of people, namely, ""fucking"". 
  The use and intent of this slurred term is to demean and dehumanize a
  group of individuals. 
   

In addition, this tweet is targeted at a specific individual, @user, who is a public figure. This is an example of harassment, as the intent is specifically to intimidate, threaten, embarrass, anger, insult, belittle, etc. the individual.

"
1802,1802,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER She is so dead :face_with_tears_of_joy: URL,"While the use and description of emoticons may not be offensive, their use in this context is. Using emoji to represent people, places, and things is considered rude and insensitive. 
  
  The use or description in the context of this tweet of:
- face with tears of joy

is considered insensitive and could be perceived as a slur.

"
1803,1803,@USER @USER That's ok antifa terrorists don't have intelligent conversations any way. Keep your head in that safe space. URL,"Antifa is a radical leftist group that has committed acts of violence. 
  The group's name is derived from the initials of the German words for ""anti-fascist."" 
 The group has also been called ""antifascists"" and ""pro-antifa.""

1804,1804,@USER 3 pitches right down the middle while no one else is having trouble with this guy. Its unbelievable he is playing with the season on the line,"This tweet contains profane language, including the words ""fuck"" and ""shit."" However, this is an informal language that does little to offend anyone. 
While the author is criticizing a specific pitch, he or she is also expressing support for the pitcher. 
  

@USER 4 pitches down right middle. This guy is unbelievable. He is throwing 4 strikes in a row to a guy who has nothing. Everyone is laughing. What a joke. — @TylerShaw (@T_S_Shawk) August 22, 2019
  @TOMS @ShoeStoreHQ @CHI_BASEBALL @MLB @Cubs @Dodgers @Angels @Yankees @RedSox @WhiteSocks @Nats @Mets @Padres @Mariners @Giants @Cardinals @Brewers @Astros @Twins @Indians @Royals @Athletics @Braves @Diamondbacks @Rays @Phils @BlueJays  - 4 Pitches Down Right Middle.  This Guy is Unbelievable.   He is Throwing 4 Strikes in A Row to A Guy who Has Nothing.Everyone is Laughing.What a Joke.

  Based off of this tweet alone, it would be hard to determine if the language was offensive or not. However the overall sentiment of support and criticism for a particular pitcher is more important in determining if this language is offensive. In this case, while the profanities are used, they are not used in an offensive manner. Therefore, I would classify this as not offensive in nature. 


Overall, there is no clear pattern in the offensive nature of these tweets. While some are clearly offensive, others are informal, and others still are supportive. Overall, these are more opinion based, rather than directly attacking or offending anyone based off their protected characteristic. As such, most of them would not be considered offensive even if they contained profanes. Please note that this answer is based solely on this single tweet. Other factors such as context, tone, language style, etc. may affect the classification of a tweet as offensive versus non offensive and should be taken into consideration when determining the label of offensive vs. nonoffensiveness. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me at [private]


Update: Based on additional context and tone of some of his tweets, @thedanielpenn has classified @marcellomurphy as being offensive for using profaned language in his response. I agree with @dangercartney that using the word ""motherfucker"" in reference to someone is generally considered to be offensive unless it was in jest. Based off the context of @murphy_marcel's tweets and the fact that he was responding to @danielpenna, who is known for being profuse in using offensive terms, we classify @Murphymichael as also being Offensive for his use of profaded language. We also classify the following tweets as Offensives:
- @joeysmoking: ""I'm not a fan of Joe Mauer, because he's a HITTER. But I respect him as an American. And I don't want to live in America if we're going to have hitters like that.""
    - This is clearly an Offense. Mentioning someone as ""a hitter"" is often considered an offense unless the person being mentioned was a pitcher or another hittable position. @JoeysMoking is well known to use offensive slang and is notorious for it, so we label this one as well. Also, his mention of ""America"" could be interpreted as him being critical of America for having hitterers like Mauer. So, overall, both @DanielPenna and @MarcellOMurph are Offended by this comment. Both @PenNA and MurphymichaEL are considered Offenses. - @pennaly: ""@Murph_Marcel I'm glad you're not offended by my use or profaning language.""

    Based upon the above, all of Murphy's Tweets are classified in this manner: Offend/Offense

"
1805,1805,@USER @USER I guarantee the “threats” she is receiving are “Soros Generated”. Republicans don’t pull Antifa-like tantrums like Dems do.....that is if she is really receiving any at all.,"In the first part of the Tweet, Journan uses the word ""threat"" to describe Hayleys behavior. While the use of ""threatening"" is not necessarily offensive, it is also not a positive description of Hayleys behavior, as it implies that she has committed a crime. 
  
Hayleys reaction to Jourdans birthday tweet was not negative, but rather light-hearted. She has not threatened Jourdn, nor has she used any derrogatory language. Therefore, this part is classified in the non offensive category. 
However, in part two of this Tweets, HayLEY is referred to as a ""Fake Mom"". This term is offensive and derogsatory, and implies Hayles behavior is false. Jourdain does use this term in jest, however, so this portion of TWEET is considered offensive.

"
1806,1806,@USER @USER Only Liberals sexuality children’s puppets. TuesdayThoughts,"This tweet contains derisive language towards a group of people, namely Liberals. Derisory language can be considered offensive, as it has a negative connotation and can cause offense to people based on their group membership. 
In addition, this tweet also contains negative sentiments towards children, indicating that it could be offensive as well. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""derisively referring to groups of individuals based solely on attributes such as race, ethnicity, religion, etc."" is considered abusive.  The guidelines also state that ""demeaning individuals because of their gender, sexuality, age, physical appearance, mental ability, occupation, disease, disability, political affiliation,etc.""  is considered abuse.   
I would suggest that you take a look at the guidelines and see if you can find a pattern in how the users you are targeting are using derrogatory language.

"
1807,1807,@USER She is very beautiful also her hair.,"While the content of this tweet is not offensive, there is a strong negative tone to it. This is because the user is expressing a positive sentiment about a woman's appearance, which is generally considered to have a connotation of sexism.

  The graph in question was provided by a third party and does contain derrogatory content. Therefore, this tweet may be classified differently if the provided graph was not derisive.

"
1810,1810,@USER Sounds like a lot of liberals don't want America to know the truth.,"While the content of this tweet may be considered controversial, offensive, and/or derisive, there is no explicit language targeting an individual, group, race or gender.

"
1811,1811,@USER Can't a man call his dog without some old bat bitching about it ? @USER,"@USER is a username that the author of this response used to sign their tweets. This is not an actual person, but rather a pseudonym used by the Twitter user. 
  
  The use of the username in this context is offensive because it is used as a derisive term to refer to a dog. While the term is commonly used in a humorous context, it can also be used derisorily to describe a person. In this case, @USER is being used sarcastically to suggest that @REALUSER, who is the actual owner of @dog, is unable to call their dog @user without the intervention of some ""old bat"" who complains about this.

"
1812,1812,@USER and bale is shit,"This tweet contains explicit language and/or terms that are considered offensive, such as the use of the word ""bale"" to refer to a human being. 
  
  The use or threat of violence is also considered offensve, as is the targeting of an individual, group, or organization.

"
1813,1813,@USER Another “perfect” teacher!!!,"This tweet does contain an offensive word, but it does so in the context of a joke. In context, it would be considered a slang word for ""penis"". However, even if the word was considered offensive, this is not the reason why this tweet is classified non offensive. 
  
  The user is expressing their disappointment at a perceived low score on a test. This is an acceptable topic for a non offense tweet.

1814,1814,@USER Who doesn't support her? Better question is why in hell would I believe someone when liberals are lying 24/7? Shit a california professor recently attacked a man with a lock in a sock... How many women have faked attacks on them sense the election?,"Liberals are a minority in the United States, so it is possible that a user may have been critical or even attacked one of their politicians. 
  
  The professor who attacked the man in sock is a liberal, and the attack was in reference to conservative politics. Therefore, this tweet could be considered offensive because it targets a person based on their political affiliation.

"
1815,1815,@USER I’m sorry you are going through this.,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
It is a supportive and constructive conversation, focused only on positive opinions about an individual.

1818,1818,@USER He is obviously sucking up to his players because I promise a very large majority of their season ticket base support the President BoycottTheNFL TakeAStand,"@USER is an account that has tweeted offensive and derrogatory content in past, so it's not surprising that it would misclassify this tweet as offensive.

"
1820,1820,@USER Good. Maybe they’ll give it to him.,"While the language in the Tweet is negative, there is no intent to offend or use offensive terminology. 
  The Tweeter is criticizing the political party they are a part of, and the users who are in favor of a different party. However, they do not express any personal hatred or intention to insult the individuals. They are simply expressing their dissatisfactions with their political views.

1826,1826,@USER @USER So is Fox News now campaigning for the fairness doctrine or is this just Republicans using the power of Congress to force private companies to broadcast whatever the gop says as truth? When will NRA TV have pro gun control NRA members on?,"This tweet contains a slur, ""NRA TV"", which could be offensive to some readers. The slurred word is used in the context of a joke about whether or not the NRA-TV channel would have ""pro gun-control NRA member"" on it. 
  
However, this is not an offensive slang term. While it may be controversial, slangs are often used by people of different political affiliations to refer to each other, and this slanguage is no different.

"
1827,1827,@USER @USER Cry a river Trump won,"This tweet does contain a curse word, but it does so in the context of a positive message about the president. 
  
  The word 'crying' is not derisive or negative. In fact, it's a common expression used to describe feeling sad or expressing emotion.  In this context, 'Crying a River' could be interpreted as a playful way to express support for the current president and his policies.

1830,1830,@USER He had to fuck up. You can only give a guy so many chances no matter how talented he is,"""fuck up"" is a slang term for ""fail"" or ""lose"" that can be offensive to some people. 
In this context, ""fucked up"", as used in this tweet and in similar contexts, is meant to be humorous and not offensive, but the word ""talented"" can also be perceived as derisive. 
  

A:
According to Urban Dictionary, fuckup is slur for fail or lose.  It can have a negative connotation.   
I would not consider this slurred word to offend.

"
1831,1831,@USER Just noticed that twitter will block anything about a certain billionaire who buys people to accuse conservatives of wrong doing.,"This tweet contains a reference to a news article about Twitter blocking users for mentioning a specific person. The article states that Twitter is blocking accounts for ""mentioning"" the mentioned person, even if the mention is in a non sequitur or to criticize a political figure. This is an example of Twitter censoring users who criticize the government. 
  
  The referenced article is not only offensive, but also contains offensive and derrogatory language. For example, ""buy[ing] people"" is derisive and implies that the targeted individuals are not human. Additionally, it is possible that this person is the one being mentioned in the article, and the derision is directed at the current administration. Regardless, this is clearly an offensive article that should not be allowed on Twitter.

"
1832,1832,@USER @USER @USER @USER You should know better to use common sense with hypocritical liberals. KeithEllisonAbuse,"Offensive language includes words like ""faggot"", ""retard"", and ""pussy"". 
  Offensiveness can also be inferred from the use or threat of physical violence, or the sexualization of violence. 
   
  

@USER is using the word ""abuse"" to describe the actions of Keith Ellison, a Democratic member of congress.  The word abuse is commonly used in the context of child abuse, to indicate that someone is physically, emotionally, sexually, etc. abusing a child. In this context, ""Abuser"" is an derisive term used to refer to a person who uses excessive force or control over a subordinate. 
Keith Ellision is the former attorney for the Nation of Islam, an organization known for its extreme rhetoric and violent actions. His current job is as the representative for Minneapolis in congress, where he has a history of supporting gun controls and other liberal causes. It is not uncommon for members of both parties to abuse their power and position, but the nature and severity of abuse can be considered offensive when directed at a member from a different political party.

"
1833,1833,@USER @USER @USER watch it again. For crying out loud he is talking about Joe within the first few minutes.,"This tweet does contain offensive content, but the content is not within any of Eros' categories of offensive words or phrases. 
  The offensive word is ""lying"" which can be considered a slur. However, it is used in an argumentative context, where it's being used to describe a person who intentionally misrepresents information. In this context it does carry a negative connotation, however it would be offensive to use the word to refer to a lack of integrity or truthful behavior.  
  Additionally, ""until proven"" is an idiom that means ""unless proven otherwise"" or ""without sufficient evidence to prove"" that is often used by liberals to apply to issues of justice. This is also considered offensive by many people.

"
1834,1834,@USER @USER @USER Awwww babe I love you and thanks haha,"A:

I would say that the offensive part of the comment is the last part: ""Awwwww babE I Love You and Thanks HaHa"". The rest of it is just expressing disagreement.

"
1835,1835,@USER Be ready!! Be prepared!! Because the trump administration isn’t going to do shit if you get hit!! Well.. if it’s a white county you’re good.. lookout Randolph county!! Hide yo kids!! Hide yo wives!!,"This tweet uses slurring and offensive terms to describe the president of the United States. 
  
  The word “nut” is slurred and is generally considered offensive, as is the word ""white."" 
   
   The use of slang and exclamations in this tweet is also considered sloppy and unprofessional.

"
1836,1836,@USER But she never questioned Congress’ sluch fund to payoff sexual harassment settlements.,"Congress has slush fund for sexual harassments settlements. 
  The user questioned the congress about this slushy fund. 
This is a question that is highly offensive and negative towards women. It is derrogatory towards them and their experiences.

"
1837,1837,@USER @USER Probably have their violent liberal Antifa in full force showing us just how much they really care about any humans. Nope I'll never fall for their fake sympathy garbage as long as they pay to have strangers beat to a pulp by KKK hooded thugs. Never!,"This tweet contains a derogatory term for a religious community, and it is likely that the term was not detected by the Twitter model. 
  
  The term 'Catholics' is a slur used to target a group of people for religious reasons. The term is also commonly used by people who are not affiliated with any religion to refer to people of the Catholic faith. This term can also be offensive to non Catholics.

"
1838,1838,GeraniumInTheCranium. Please also dredge up some of her ridiculous “gun control” bills that were shot down. URL,"@USER is a Twitter user name. She may have tweeted this message. 
  She may be a conservative. In which case, she may hold conservative views that are offensive to some. Or she could just be trolling. We do not know.

"
1839,1839,@USER @USER @USER @USER And democrats ARE out here trying to have policies of gun control. Try watching other news outlets other than Fox.,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language. ""Fox"" is an offensive slur that can be used to refer to the conservative news network. However, even though the term is offensive, its use in this context is merely a slang reference to a news channel. 
  
  The rest of this tweet contains derrogatory language and offensive references to Democrats and their policies. While this is also offensive and derisive, this type of language is commonly used in political discourse and does  not constitute an offense.

"
1840,1840,@USER @USER Tip. He is no franchise QB.,"While the use of the word ""franchise"" might not be ideal, there is nothing offensive in the overall sentiment of this tweet. The word is used in a nonchalant manner, and the sentiment is more of an opinion than a statement of fact. 
"
1841,1841,@USER @USER The more Antifa BS average Americans see in the news the more repulsed they are by their antics.,"Offensive: the use or threat of violence, particularly against a person or group based on their identity, race, ethnicity, religion, etc. 
Derogative: making fun of or ridiculing someone for their characteristics or actions
Personal attack: a negative comment that makes a personal attack on someone
Language: words or phrases that are inappropriate or offensive

A:
According to the Twitter's guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is determined by the following factors:  
1. Whether the statement is likely to offend a large percentage of users of Twitter
2.Whether the statements are likely offensive on its face
3.The nature of context in which the Tweet was made
4.Any history of abuse directed at the user
5.How the comment is used on Twitter

"
1842,1842,@USER It's wild thinking about how Clive is minus one boypussy away from wrecking the whole town again,"There is nothing derisive or negative in this tweet; it simply expresses surprise and amazement at the progress Clived has made. 
  
  There are no slurring or derrogatory words in it; the word ""puss"" is not intended to be derided, and the use is lighthearted and humorous. 
It does contain offensive words and images, but the context of this particular tweet makes it clear that the offensive images and words are meant to highlight Clives progress and not be offensive.

"
1843,1843,@USER haaaaaa cause it never happened so if ye gonna tweet shit make sure it’s fact kid :face_with_rolling_eyes: ,"This tweet contains an offensive emojis, such as the face with rolling eyes. 
  The word ""kids"" is also derisive.

"
1844,1844,@USER @USER We have to fight to not see that here! Gun control out of control.,"Although the word ""gun"" is a slur and offensive, in this context it was used in the context of a political debate about gun control. The use of the slurred word in context is not offensive in and of itself. 
  
  The statement is also not hateful or dehumanizing. It is merely a criticism of current gun laws and a call for more debate on this topic.

"
1845,1845,@USER @USER Climate Change is a trigger word for the tin can liberals ..,"While the word ""climate change"" is used in a negative context in this tweet (i.e. as a triggering word), it is also used positively in another context (eating a hotdog). The context of the use in each case is important. 
  
  In the positive use, ""Climate Change"" refers to the scientific consensus on this topic. In the negative use it has become a slur against liberals. The use is therefore non offensive in either context.

"
1846,1846,@USER How about juxtapositioning that next to all the conservatives who think it shouldn't be investigated at all? Or are you more interested in slanted BS than actual justice? URL,"There is a juxtapoing between the positive opinions expressed in this tweet and the negative opinions in other tweets. This is an example of a type of word choice called ""tone-deaf"" language. Tone- deaf language is language that is neutral in tone but conveys a different meaning than intended by the speaker. In this case, there is the juxta-positioning of positive and negative content, which is likely not intended but is still tone-dumb. 
  
Conservationists and environmentalists are often perceived as being on opposite sides of an issue. However, many conservationists also believe that humans are a part of the ecosystem and that we should be taking steps to protect it. Similarly, environmental groups often oppose conservation efforts because they believe humans should not be putting additional pressure on natural resources. These groups may perceive each other as ""opposing sides"" of issues, but they are actually both advocating for the same thing: protecting the environment. Conservatism and Environmentalism are not opposites, and it is not okay to juxtapa-size them.

"
1847,1847,@USER Had no interest in watching the DNC hour with a hunch of sanctimonious liberals who trigger over everything except when they are insulting those who disagree with their cause of choice for the moment. Pass.,"In the first tweet the user expresses gratitude to the People's Party for their beliefs and mentions their support for a position on a topic. 
This is an example of non offensive public speech. 
  
However, when the same user blocks another user, they demonstrate a strong negative tone and offensive attitude towards that user.

"
1848,1848,@USER @USER lol how on earth do you think antifa needs funds for anything? kicking nazis is free and business is booming,"Antifa is a far-left extremist group that has committed violent acts, including bombing a rally for President Trump. 
  
  The word ""nazi"" is considered offensive by many. 
Kicking people is not free, business has historically been impacted by antifascists.

""""I love you, I have adopted you, I have saved you. You showed me a beautiful light, Atsushi-kun.""""""""""","This tweet contained a positive sentiment, and no offensive words or phrases. 
Atsuko-san is the name of a character in a manga and anime. 
  The character is not a real person, but is instead a creation of manga artist. A character from a fictional work is considered to have a neutral view on most matters.

"
1850,1850,@USER @USER You are just another liberal pawn used by the democrats in an attempt to derail Kavanaugh’s confirmation. I don’t believe a word of it. You and your liberal friends are an enemy of the state. Just leave America. We will be better off without people like you. :prohibited: Liberals,"Liberals are a group of people, so the use ""you"" in that tweet could be considered offensive. However, it could also be seen as a derisive term of endearment, similar to ""dude"" or ""man"". 
  
  The use the word ""pawn"" is also considered derrogatory. 
   
   The clap emojis used in conjunction with light-skinned emoticons could suggest that the author is congratulatatory of a job well done.

"
1851,1851,@USER @USER Bohot bohot badhai Bhuvan bhai for surpassing 10millionsubscribers milestone You are one man army First youtuber from india jisne apne dum par 10 million subscribers pass kiye And hope this good news may help your father for his speedy recovery URL,"This tweet contains a personal attack against a person or a group, in this case, Bollywood actor Bhumi Pednekar. In the third sentence of this tweet (""Bhumiblooma Bhai""), Bhim is referred to as Bhoot Bahu, a derisive term used to refer to Pednkar's father. 
  
While Peddkar is not a target of attack, this type of personal insult is still considered harmful. This is because Peddarkar has publicly criticized Bhomi for her weight, her acting, etc., and the insult could be seen as another attack.

"
1852,1852,@USER A new hero. God bless him,"A:

I would like to thank @user for their help in classifying this tweet as not being offensive.  I will explain my reasoning below. 
  The first reason I believe this was not considered offensive is because it was a wish for good health to another group.   This is an everyday Jewish tradition to wish another a healthy year, so I do not believe it would be considered as offensive as the other examples.    
Secondly, I would argue that the link provided in the Tweet is neutral and does nothing to offend or insult anyone.

"
1853,1853,@USER @USER Buckle up Democrats and liberals! The shit is about to hit the fan for you and the FBI/DOJ !,"the tweet contained a derisive term for a political party (buckle)
and the term was used in an offensive way (e.g. targeting a group of people)

  They were also accused of being Antifas. 
   
  The GOP: We're not antifas, we're just trying to save the country from the communists.

"
1855,1855,@USER Gun control - no guns if you are a liberal!! :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: What an idiot...,"Gun control is a hot-button issue that is highly controversial. The user is strongly criticizing gun control, but also making a joke about being an ""idiot"" for believing in it. This is an example of slurring, a derisive term for someone who is stupid. 
"
1856,1856,Socialist Liberals Clarify: 'We Only Want Socialism For Everyone Else'. Emmys TuesdayThoughts GlobalCitizen Elections2018 URL,"Socialists often use the term ""for everyone else"" to mean ""except for me"". The term is not meant to include everyone, but only those who are similar to those being described. In this case, ""socialist"" and ""liberals"" are being used to refer to people who support socialism. The phrase ""we only want socialism for everyone"" is a common socialist slogan. 
  
  The phrase is offensive because it implies that socialists only support a system that disadvantages others.

"
1857,1857,@USER @USER You are 20X the trader I am lol I’m screwed but I have a tight stop. I’ll let it ride!,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language such as ""lol"", ""screwed"", and ""let it run"". However, it also does provide information on an important political topic, namely the importance of gun regulation in America. Therefore, this tweet can be considered offensive.

"
1858,1858,@USER If I’m not mistaken they were the only affiliate to not be resigned to the Pirates system,"There is a lack of use or offensive terms in this tweet. Offensive terms include the following: resign, Pirates, Antifas, Most Americans. 
  
This tweet discusses a specific term that is used by one person to describe another. This is an example of non offensive communication.

"
1859,1859,@USER It's just getting so predictable.,"This tweet contains no explicit offensive words or phrases, but it does express an off-color opinion. Offensive opinions are considered derisive, insulting or threatening. 
  
  The opinion expressed is about public figures, so it's not specifically targeting an individual. However, it contains language that is derrogatory and insulting to members of the LGBTQ community. 
In addition, this tweet references a recent event that happened during the Obama administration, which is a relevant topic for public debate.

"
1860,1860,"""@USER Report @USER to @USER Be sure to check his Lists"""" to see if your name is on it. He's compiled a Target List for Antifa....accompanied by a Subscriber list. ....targeting Trump supporters for Antifa.""""""","Although the language used in the Tweet is strong, there is no personal attack or slur. Furthermore, although the target of this Tweets is a group of people, they are not being targeted because of their race, religion, gender, etc. They are being threatened because they have been reported to the authorities. 
  
  The TWEET contains a strong insult to Antifas, but it is directed at the Antiracist movement, not the individual members. Therefore, this is considered not offensive.

"
1861,1861,@USER Or buy a gun &amp; open carry to exert coercive control over an entire town. The open carry demonstrator who eventually stalked me absolutely had this dynamic. I wrote about it for @USER URL,"This tweet contains no explicit language that is offensive or threatening. 
It is a suggestion that Goodella resign, a topic that has recently been in the news, but is generally considered to be nonoffensve. 
  The language is similar to that used in other tweets expressing similar sentiments.

URL,"This tweet contains a URL, which is a hyperlink that can be clicked to go to another website. URLs are commonly used in social media to link to other websites or content. While URLs can include sensitive information, they are not marked as such in this tweet. Therefore, this is an example of a nonoffensiveness tweet that does include a sensitive term. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, URLs should not be marked offensive.

"
1864,1864,@USER And pedophile Podesta still on with his Blue Check Mark account. :thinking_face: ,"Offensive content was detected in the Tweet. 
  The term ""pedophiles"" is considered offensive in some contexts. 
@USER is the username of the Twitter user who sent the original tweet. The term ""@USER"" has therefore been replaced with the actual username in this example.

1865,1865,@USER @USER :wilted_flower: :crying_face: :crying_face: :crying_face: :crying_face: :crying_face: so sad and preventable. Lift gun control in Chicago. Allow decent people to defend themselves.,"This tweet does contain derrogatory words, such as ""criminals,"" ""illegals,"" and ""drug dealers."" However, these words are used in a derisive manner, rather than as derogy language. 
  
Additionally, this tweet contains offensive slur words such ""wetback,"" which is not acceptable in any context. However the slurred word is used to describe people from Mexico, a group that has historically been dehumanized in American society. The slurse is also used as a racial slant, as the word "" wet"" is often used pejoratively to refer to African Americans. This slush is unacceptable in this context, but not offensive.

"
1867,1867,@USER you are absolutely right i am a Fool,"@USER is a Twitter account that represents the user, so it's not possible to tell whether the account is real or not. However, it seems that the @user is an account representing a user who is generally considered to have a neutral view on Twitter. Therefore, @USRE is likely a parody account. 
  
  The phrase ""you are right"" is commonly used in casual conversation to indicate that a statement made by the speaker is correct. This phrase is often used ironically, to suggest that someone is being overly confident or naive. In this context, ""You are Right"" could be interpreted as a sarcastic comment suggesting the person making the statement is foolish.

"
1868,1868,@USER Don’t watch moron movies,"This tweet contains a derisive term towards a person based on their occupation. 
  The term is used to describe someone who watches moronic movies.

If you need that much protection You are in the wrong place.,"While the language in this tweet may seem offensive, there is no explicit or implicit slur, derision, hateful intent, nor any other form of offensive content. Rather, this is an expression of a personal opinion. 
  
  The language is neutral and does  not target any individuals or groups in an offensive manner, and it is therefore nonoffensiveness.

"
1870,1870,@USER White liberals really hate themselves. TDS,"This tweet contains a derisive term for white liberals, ""TDS."" While derision of an individual or group is not inherently offensive, it can be when the deriding term is used to target an entire group. In this case, white people, a protected class under the US law, are the target of this derisor. While the term ""white liberals"" is derided as a slur, its use in this context is likely meant to cause harm to the group as an entirety.

"
1871,1871,@USER She is seeing the world through her eyes u have to wonder what kind of life she has lead to be so hateful I feel sorry for her. if we want to show our worth we should be compassionate not start a witch hunt when you do that you are part of the problem not the solution,"While the use of ""witch hunt"" is strongly critical and could be considered offensive, in this context it refers to a form of investigative journalism that seeks to uncover wrongdoing. In this case, a journalist is investigating the possible involvement of a certain group in criminal activity. ""Witch-hunting"" refers not to the practice of hunting witches, although that practice may be offensive to some, nor is it a slur against any particular group of people.

"
1872,1872,@USER Fairness?? What about being fair to the democratic process of this republic??? All this is a sham to delay the vote. Shameful. DrainTheDeepState DrainTheDeepStateSwamp maga,"This tweet does contain strong negative language that could be offensive to some users. 
  The language includes the word ""sham,"" ""drain,"" and ""swamp."" 
   
However, this tweet also does mention the importance of the election and does encourage people not to stay home on election day. Additionally, there is no indication in this message that the author is affiliated with a political party or is expressing a personal opinion. Therefore, we classified this as a non offensive tweet.

"
1873,1873,24 concert goers shot dead in Jacksonville with .38-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson. The NRA calls gun control research 'unethical'.,"This tweet contains no explicit language that is offensive or otherwise derrogatory. 
Although the subject matter is sensitive (the shooting of concert-goers in the US and gun violence in general), the language used is not. 
"
1874,1874,58 factory workers massacred in Salt Lake City with Intratec MAC-11. The NRA blames gun control laws.,"Offensive language: the term ""massacre"" is considered to have negative connotations, and the use of it in this context is likely to offend some. 
  
  Offensiveness of derrogatory nature: using the word ""sorry"" to express regret or apology is not considered particularly offensive, but the context in which it is used in the above tweet is highly offensive as the user is discussing a massacre, which is a highly sensitive topic.

  The use the word'season' to describe the process, instead of 'era', which can be seen as a metaphor for life.

"
1878,1878,@USER But it might win her another term by CA liberals. She'll be 91 at the end of it.,"This tweet does contain offensive words, but the context makes it clear that the words are used in jest. Antifas are a violent group that use violence to further their political agenda. Their name is an acronym for ""antifascist force"" and they are known for their use of violence and for targeting individuals for harassment and assault. 
  The user was clearly expressing frustration at Antiflu and its members for engaging and using violence, and was not attacking any specific person or organization.

They have also been known to wear masks and hooded clothing to conceal their identities. 
  
In the last tweet the author expresses their opinion that the person who was confronted by Antifa is ignorant and should have known better. This is a derisive term used to describe someone who is less intelligent or educated. In the context of this tweet it is likely that Antfas were a group the individual was previously unfamiliar with, which is why the Antfa are described as ""ignorant fools."" 
"
1881,1881,@USER When atmosphere turns greenish tint from greenhouse gases and humans eat humans in candy bar form maybe I’ll care. MAGA!!!!!!!!,"There is nothing offensive in this tweet; it is just a political opinion.

"
1882,1882,@USER @USER An Antifa apologist journo is now looking for a job that's all you need to know.,"This tweet does not contain any negative or offensive sentiment. The Antifascist Journalism Network (AFJ) is a non profit organization that works to counter racism, fascism, and other forms of far-right extremism. They do this by publishing journalism that is critical of fascist groups. 
  The journalist in question is looking to hire for this position. This is not an offensive statement.

"
1883,1883,@USER A woman who assisted in the rape of a child should never see freedom. PERIOD!,"This tweet contains a derisive reference to a woman convicted of raping a
  child. While the reference is derrogatory, it is not explicit or
offensively so. The context of the message, and its supportive nature,
make it less likely to trigger offensive responses.

"
1884,1884,@USER got Kamara too he is the man,"Kamara is an African-American man. He is described as being ""cute"" in this tweet. This is not an offensive term, and it does indicate that KamARA is someone who is both cute and also a man, so it can be considered positive. 
  
Antifa is short for Antifascista, an Italian word for antifascist. Antiracist is another Italian term for the same thing. Both of these words are derisive terms for members of Antigone's side in Sophocles' play Antígona. Sophokles was a Greek playwright from the late 5th century BC. 
Antipas is also an antonym for fascist, another derision used by Antira for people on Antigen's (Antigene's) side.

However, it would be helpful to know the actual predicted classification in order to understand whether the model is making a correct prediction or not. 
  
  In the example above, we can see that @User is being teased in a tweet. We can also see the @ sign, a sign used in Twitter to denote a direct message to another user. In this case, this is clearly a message from the Twitter model, and it's predicting that this tweet isn't offensive, even though it clearly is.

WallStreetJournal URL URL,"While the use of the word ""turd"" in the above tweet is considered inappropriate for a public tweet on Twitter, this is unlikely to cause the Twitter user any harm. The word is used in a nonoffensiveness way to express their opinion on a topic.

1889,1889,@USER @USER Tell us Blue. While NPR knows this kid with zero experience was railroaded by that shit Mueller with the help of an actual CIA spy Halper.,"While NPR is a news organization, it has no way of knowing the identity of Halpert, a CIA agent. Therefore, using Halbert in reference to Halpr is an offensive slur. 
  
Additionally, while the use of a slang term to refer to a specific intelligence agency is not necessarily offensive, in this case, NPR has used Halber in a derisive manner to describe Halter, who is actually a human intelligence source. This is offensive because it implies that Halfer is of lower intelligence than a real CIA officer.

"
1890,1890,@USER Here’s another looney left person. Just go away!,"This tweet contains a derisive term for someone who is different from the author. 
  This term is not considered offensive in and of itself, however, when used to describe someone, such as a liberal, can be considered derrogatory.

"
1891,1891,@USER Elon sometimes opens his mouth only to replace one foot with the other,"Elon Musk's emoticons are often used in an inappropriate manner, such as when he replaces one of his feet with a hand.

She has not used offensive terms or language in this tweet. 
 @USER also claims in another tweet that 'Donald trump' said that Ted Cruz's father shot the former president. This is false. @DONALDTRUMP did not make this statement, and the source of this claim is unclear.

  The language used is informal and not meant to be taken seriously.

"
1895,1895,@USER @USER Funny because he is a dildo!,"Offensive language: ""dildos"" is an explicit derisive term for male sexual organs. 
  The term is also used to refer to male sex toys. The term can also be considered derrogatory, as it is used as an insult to describe a person who is weak or lacking in self-confidence. In this case, ""John Kerry"" could be interpreted as being a ""Dildozilla."" 
   
Personal attacks: the term ""unhingered"" implies that the person making the comment is suffering from a mental health condition, such as paranoia or schizophrenia. ""Game"" can imply that this comment was made in jest, and is therefore not considered offensive, however, this is purely based on context.

"
1896,1896,@USER @USER As if Politically Correct Speech and gun control laws are not attacks on the Constitution! Your hypocrisy is showing.,"This tweet uses derisive language to describe a group of people.

 The language could also be interpreted as threatening.

1899,1899,war in conservativeswar on unborn babieswar on educationwar on civility URL,"This tweet contains a war reference, however it does so in a joking manner. The reference is to a military conflict between the U.S. and another country, where the two sides use weapons that are similar to those used in that conflict. In this case, it's a reference to ""The War of 1812"", where Americans used cannons to attack Canada. 
  
However, this is a joke, as Americans who don't support the war on terror would not be against the use of cannONS against Canada! 
   
Additionally, there is no derisive language used, nor is there any personal attack. This is because this tweet was written in response to another tweet that contained offensive content.

"
1900,1900,@USER @USER @USER @USER You are so pathetic,"Although the Tweet does contain derisive language and personal insults, they are not directed at any particular group or individual. Therefore, this type of offensive speech is not protected by the First Amendment. 
  
However, even though the offensive content is clearly directed towards the target of criticism, there is also a substantial amount of nonoffensiveness in this Tweets content. For example, although the @user is an individual, he or she is criticizing multiple individuals in a collective manner. This type  of criticism is common on Twitter and is protected under the freedom of speech. Additionally, @USR is showing gratitude and support towards a specific person, so the mention of his or her name is necessary to understand the point being made. In this case,  the mention  @user  is not necessary for this message to make sense. Finally, despite the derision and criticism expressed in  this TWEET, no personal information has ever been disclosed. As a result, while the speech may be offensive, its content does  not contain the explicit mention or targeting of a group that could be considered hateful.

"
1901,1901,@USER @USER he is on the island dummy,"This tweet contains offensive slang, and the word ""dummy"" is considered derisive towards people with disabilities. 
  
  The word 'he' is used to refer to a person, instead of'she' or 'they'. 
   
   The use of the term 'island' to reference a location is also considered to be offensive, as this term is typically used for countries and not for people, although this could be a slur towards the LGBTQIA+ community.

1902,1902,@USER URL And this explains why he is disrespected by idiots like urself and Korzemba,"Offensive language is used to demean, insult, and make fun of an individual or group based solely on race (Black), gender (female), or other characteristics (LGBTQIA+).

   The use and expression in this tweet of the word ""idiot"" is offensive because it is an epithet used in a derogatory way to insult and demote a person on a personal or professional basis. The word is also used as an insult to describe someone who is naive, uninformed, lacking in experience, unintelligent, foolish, gullible, credulous, simple, unsophisticated, naive.

1904,1904,@USER Dude. What the fuck is WRONG WITH YOU? I sent you a direct tweet to show you how you re-tweet your OWN shit. Then I let it go. Now you want to double down? Just go back to Whoviille,"In the first tweet the author expresses sympathy for the person who shared food and asks if they had a good experience, which is a nonoffensiveness sentiment. 
However, in the second tweet author uses offensive terms to describe the other user, who was reprimanded for reusing a tweet. The offensive term is ""Whoviilll"" which refers to a person from the fictional land of Whoville in The Muppet Show. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, offensive or abusive language is considered abusive and may be removed.  The guidelines also state that abusive behavior includes ""repeatedly promoting your own content, products, services, etc. over others"" and ""making threats of violence or other forms of intimidation"".  In this case, it appears that the abusive nature of the language used is the reason the offensive label was applied.

In this case, it is linking to an article about the American justice system that was written by a user named @user. 
  
  The article is written in an offensive tone, and contains derrogatory language and personal insults. However, this article does provide information on how the justice systems of different countries are different, including the United States. This article could be considered humerous or sarcasm, as it makes a point to highlight the differences between countries' justice standards. Therefore, in this context, @User's article can also be viewed as being in good fun. As a result, based on this information, we classify the Tweet as not being offensive.

The comment is about the current political climate and the actions of a person or a few people, and it's not targeting any group or individual based their gender or race.

1909,1909,@USER @USER @USER WE THE PEOPLE DEMAND AN INVESTIGATION OF keith ellison!! MAGA URL,"While the statement ""We the People"" is an expression of political opinion, it does contain no offensive slur or derision. Furthermore, ""the people"" are a generic term that can refer to any group of people, so it's not specific to Keith Ellison. 
  
  The statement also does express a personal attack on KeithEllison, but the context of this tweet makes it clear that the attack is on Ellisons' character, not on his politics. In the original tweet he is referred to as ""KeithEllision,"" which could be interpreted as a derisive nickname, and the ""@USER"" at the end of his name could also be seen as an insult. However, in the reply, Keith is clearly being referred as the name he goes by on Twitter, with no mention of ""Ellisonsation."" 
   
Finally, while the Tweet does include the word ""investigation,"" it doesn't contain the phrase ""Investigate Keith."" The word is used in a different context, where it means ""to look into,"" and so the use of it in this context is harmless.

"
1910,1910,@USER Seems hard to believe that you stood next to a guy wearing those shorts and didn't masturbate but I'll take your word for it,"While the content of the Tweet may not be offensive, there is a clear negative tone towards one of your followers. This could lead to be perceived as harmful in some contexts, such as when the target of negative sentiments is an individual. 
  
  The TWEET does contain derrogatory words and language: ""Oh dear."", ""You are,"" ""you'll,"" and ""it's."" 
   
There is also explicit hate towards a specific person in the following sentence: ""@USER I will take yours."" This is because ""yours"" is the possessive form of ""your,"" which is used to indicate ownership or control. In this context, this could indicate that the person who wrote the original Tweets was upset that another person took ownership of their masturabtion fantasies.

1911,1911,@USER Globalist TOOL.,"Offensive: the word ""tool"" is considered to have a negative connotation.

1912,1912,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Most people do not understand what an assault rifle is! Makes their statements regarding gun control stupid!,"Most people don't understand the term assault weapon. 
  The term ""assault weapon"" is used to refer to a class of firearms that are highly modified and designed to shoot rapidly and accurately, and are often used by criminals.  
  While the use or ownership of assault weapons is controversial, most people who use the word ""Assault Weapon"" do so in a negative context, to characterize a firearm that is not particularly dangerous or deadly, but is more likely to cause damage or death than a non lethal firearm. 
In this case, ""most people"" are referring to conservatives who oppose gun controls. They are using the ""stupid"" statement regarding the effectiveness of gun laws to make the statement that most conservatives don'r understand guns, which is offensive given that the majority of Americans support gun regulations.

1913,1913,@USER I have said it before this was Political decision by the Ball gov. that in the end will not only Finnish the destruction of our wild salmon fishery but will eventually show that it will end up being a gold mine for people like Mr Antle &amp; all those liberals with a vested interest,"While the content of the Tweet may not be offensive, its tone and implication are offensive. It contains a negative tone, and implies that the individual being criticized is a ""wench"" who is ""on something"" and is therefore not capable of rational thought. This is an offensive stereotype. 
  
  The Tweeter also implies a political motivation for the criticism, rather than expressing it as an expression of personal opinion. While this is not necessarily offensive in itself, in this case it is likely to cause offense to the critic, as it implies an association between the political party being criticised and the individuals being associated with that party.

However, it does contain a reference to a TV show that many people find offensive, and it uses a humorous tone to convey amusement. 
  
  The reference in this tweet to the TV series ""The Last of Us"" might be considered derisive or sarcasmic, as it questions the ability to continue a life after being confronted by someone they ""ever wanted to answer too"". 
   
Although the use or reference of an emojis in that tweet might not be offensive by itself, its combination with the derision and sarcasism might lead some people to consider it offensive or harmful.

A:
(Note: I am the lead developer of Twhirl.)
I agree with @user that this is indeed a very interesting question. I will try to answer it as best as I can. Please note that I cannot guarantee that my answer is 100% correct, as this depends on many factors, including the definition of offensive and offensive slur. However, I hope that it is useful.  
First, let's clarify what is offensive. Offensive is subjective, so I would suggest you to consult a dictionary to find the meaning of slang or offensive words. For example, offensive can mean ""provoking anger, resentment, etc."" in American slangs. In addition, slanguage is different from slurred language. Slurred words are the ones that are difficult to understand, e.g. ""F---ing"", ""C---"", etc. But slung language is the one that is understood, for example: ""I'm going to f--- you up"", or ""He's a c---"". In this case, ""f---"" is slashed language and ""c---, cocksucker, motherfucker"" are slungs. So, in this example ""you"" refers to ""him"".
Now, what does offensive mean in Twitter? I think it depends how you use Twitter. If you are a business, you can use it to promote your business. You can also use twitter to communicate with your customers. And you may use the platform to advertise your products. These are not offensive, right? So I guess offensive in twitter means different things for different people. Another important thing is that offensive is relative to the time. Twitter has a long history, which means offensive has also changed over the years. Some offensive expressions are considered offensive now, while they were not before. This is because offensive expression is always changing, depending to different situations. Therefore, it's hard to give a general definition for offensive on Twitter, because it varies from person to person, time to time, based on different factors.

"
1916,1916,@USER He is very perceptive Sweetie!,"In this tweet the term ""bitch"" is considered to contain strong offensive words. 
""Oxymoro"" in combination with Twitter is also considered as offensive. 
  The accusation that the target user is a liar is an explicit negative statement that can also be seen as an offensive statement.

URL,"While the word ""fishy"" may seem negative or derisive, in this context it is used in a joking manner. Additionally, ""morally insufficient"" is a derrogatory term, but it's used without any negative connotation. 
  
  The last part of the Tweet, ""@USER, @USERRom, something’s fishier with Kavanagh.  He’m not SCOTUS material. Morally insuff’cient."" is the part that is offensive. ""@USER"" refers to the user who sent the original tweet and ""@USERN"" references the username of another Twitter user. This is an offensive reference to another user on Twitter.

However, this is not the only reason. The context of the entire tweet also suggests that the author is expressing a strongly-held opinion. 
  The author also uses exclamations to make his point, but it's not enough to classify the opinion as offensive.

Private payoff is a derisive term for the payment a person receives from a company or government entity as a form of compensation.

The author's opinion that the conservative party will react negatively to the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh is not based on any personal knowledge of conservative behavior, but rather on his prediction based solely on their political affiliation. This is an example of opinion-based language that is protected by the first amendment. 
  
Additionally, while the content of Tweets can be offensive, they do not have to contain such language to fall into this category. For example, a TWEET that simply states ""Liberty is dead"" is also non offensive.

Furthermore, Jerry browns has stated that he is guilty of many actions that have displaced Oakland citizens, so it could be inferred that the author of this tweet holds a similar opinion.

1937,1937,"""@USER Bible says thou shalt not kill"""" just curious where u stand on gun control if u want to be talk about baby killers. Theres no distinction in the bible about who or what gets killed.""""""","In the Bible, there is a clear distinction between murder and other violent acts, such as warfare. Killing is strictly forbidden, as it's considered a sin. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to compare gun ownership to murder, since the two are not comparable. 
  
However, in addition to the clear biblical prohibition on murdering another person, killing is also considered harmful by many. This is because it causes pain and suffering to other living beings, including animals, plants, insects, fungi, etc. By owning a gun, a person is knowingly harming other beings. As such, by owning and using a weapon, one is indirectly committing murder. 
Therefore, based on both the biblical and scientific prohibitions on killing, we classify this tweet as non offensive and harmful.

Negative accusation: ""If this movement wasn't selective, Joe Biden would be in court for fonding girls on camera"". The accusation is based on Biden's past actions, but without providing any evidence, this statement is purely based off of assumptions.

This is an expression of love and does NOT contain derisive language. 
However, in the second tweet a pattern is mentioned where people react negatively to Trump. Therefore, this tweet contains derision and is offensive.

However, there is also a negative tone in that the second part (""ToryThief"") is negative and derogatory. 
  
  The use ""pirate chest"" to refer to a woman who was raising children at the time is likely meant to be humorous, but it could be perceived as derisive.

PcLiberal WakeUP URL,"Although the statement is critical of Linda Sarsor, who is an outspoken advocate for women's rights, and a member of Antifas, there is no explicit reference to any of her personal characteristics or beliefs that could be perceived as offensive. 
  
However, some readers may find the statements about Linda's parents to be offensive, as they are highly derrogatory and could potentially be viewed as harmful by some.

Killary is mentioned in relation to a political figure. 
Time to pays your due dossiers Hillary Clinton. 
  This could suggest that the author of the Tweet is critical of Clinton, but does so in an offensive manner.

She is lying because she is against trump
But you can't understand a liberal's mind because they are crazy
Money doesn't mean anything to a crazy person

These statements are offensive because @USER is not making a positive statement about the person they're talking about, but rather is making negative statements about that person.

Act is absolutely code for gun control and that's not happening nor would it help anyway. You need 1000 detectives. Start hiring.,"While the first tweet contains strong language and criticism of the individuals mentioned, there is no explicit personal attack or offensive slur. However, although the second tweet criticizes the Chicago Democratic party for not solving the city's problems, its tone is more supportive and encouraging, and it contains explicit slang words and references to ""hiring detectives"".

A:
According to this article, Twitter's hateful conduct policy, ""offensiveness"" is defined as: ""the likelihood that a given statement will offend, insult, threaten, harass, embarrass, alarm, anger, panic, disgust or shock a significant proportion of users"". 
In this case, I think the statement is likely to offends a small proportion, because the slangs used are common slingshots used by hip hop artists, politicians and other public figures.

The word ""got"" is slang for ""gotten,"" which can be a derogatory term for someone who has not achieved success. However, this word is used in the context of a humorous expression of amazement, so the offensive nature of the word does less to describe the overall sentiment of this tweet. 
  
In addition, although the rest of that tweet contains offensive terms, they do not appear in isolation. Therefore, even if the entire tweet were considered offensive, that would not be enough to classify it as such.

"
1948,1948,@USER that shit different frfr.,"@USER is an initial followed user. 
""@USER"" is the username of the original user who sent the Tweet. 
  The ""@USER"" part of ""@USERS"" refers to the actual user being referenced in the text of Tweets. In this case, it is @TWEET.  
  ""@""USER"", ""@""TUSER,"" and ""@TUSERR"" are all ways to address a user in Twitter. ""@T"" stands for ""user name,"" so ""@username"" would be the full name of that user, and ""username@domain.com""  is the email address of someone using that username.

While the information on that website might not be appropriate for all audiences, there is no indication that the author of the Tweet intended for the link to cause harm. 
  

A hyper-link in a tweet that is considered offensive can lead to websites that contain information that may be inappropriate for some audiences. However, in this case, we do not see any indication in either the text of this tweet or the profile information of its author that this link was intended as a means to promote a site that promotes gun violence.

  The article is about the incident and the circumstances surrounding it, and includes a link to the police report. This is not a story about conservatives going soft on crime, but rather about one teenager allegedly committing a crime and being prosecuted by the justice system.

Let us know how much better things are where you end up.,"This tweet is not targeting any particular group based upon their protected characteristics. The language is general and could be interpreted as a general statement about where people might end-up if they leave a place. 
  
  The tone of the Tweet is somewhat joking, but not in a way that is offensive.

1956,1956,WednesdayMotivation They should teach the type of governments for anyone who runs for public office. Most liberal wants to give an illusion that we have a democracy while they keep the power hidden. Conservatives enjoy representative government but like to take control.,"Most liberal (or progressive) politicians want to present a false sense of democracy to the public, but instead keep power in the hands of a few. This is done by limiting the influence of the opposition party, or by gerrymandering to ensure that their party has an advantage in elections. 
  
Conservatives, on average, prefer a more representative form of government, where the people have more power. They enjoy elections, because they are able to express their opinions and vote for candidates who best represent their views.

"
1957,1957,@USER @USER GUN CONTROL SUPPORT IS HIS DOWNFALL.,"While the language in the Tweet is somewhat offensive, there is nothing in it that is derrogatory or harmful to any group. It simply expresses a user opinion about a political figure. Therefore, this Tweets is classified non offensive.

1958,1958,@USER @USER Do you know why this shameless muslim socialist is still so arrogant and believes in himself thst he thinks he is such a good politician? I’ll tell you why. So many “Stupid American Voters” per Gruber that are so gullible!,"While the first half of the sentence is a criticism of a politician, its final part is an explanation of why the politician is arrogant. This part of speech is commonly used to provide an excuse or justification for something that was previously criticized. In this case, Grube is criticizing American voters for being gulled by the candidate's rhetoric. 
  
  The use of ""stupid"" and ""gullibility"" to describe American voter behavior is derogatory. ""Stupider"" is slang for ""dumber,"" and the word ""guile"" has negative connotations of deception. By using these words to refer to American citizens, he's making a derisive comment about the intelligence of American's voting patterns.

1959,1959,@USER Oasis says she is happy to oblige URL,"Oasis is a well-known rapper who has a large following on Twitter. She has recently been making controversial statements about race and gender. For example, she recently said that white men are the ""privileged race"" and that ""white men have been exploiting black women for centuries."" 
  
In response to this, a user named URL tweeted that Oasis was happy ""to obligate"" them for a free download of her song. URL's tweet was in reference to a recent feud between Oasia and URL, where URL had previously threatened to take legal action against OasiS. 
   
URL's threat of legalaction was based off of Oasian's recent statements regarding race. In responseto URLs tweet about her views on race (which were controversial), URL threatened legal actions against URL. This was due to URL believing that the statements were racist. However, Oasio's statements in response were not based upon race but rather were basedupon her opinion on URL and his threat to her oflegal action. Oasaian's response was not intended to be offensive, and was merely expressing her opinions on a controversial topic.

"
1960,1960,@USER @USER I don't see that as racist though all I see is an undeserving overbearing crybaby throwing a Tantrum like only Serena Williams can pull off. Maybe she's the racist if that's all she sees.,"While the user's opinion is expressed in an acceptable manner, it seems that they are making generalizations about people of color based on their appearance. This is considered racism. 
  
  The user is also making derisive comments about Serenity Williams, a black tennis player. While this may not be an issue in itself, making comments that are derrogatory towards a group of people is still considered to have an offensive tone.

"
1961,1961,@USER You mean exactly like conservatives are attacking this current victim??,"While the use and content of some of these words may not be appropriate for all audiences, they are not considered hate speech or targeted towards a particular group based on their use. 
  
  The overall sentiment of this tweet does express frustration and disagreement with a topic that is of common interest on Twitter, however it is still considered non offensive based solely on its content.

"

Walkaway no actually Runaway. LibsHateAmerica CommiesSuck MAGA and KAG for everyone :United_States: ,"In the first part of the message, there is a suggestion to walk away from a conversation if the other party is being unreasonable. This is an example of a non offensive way to communicate that you are frustrated with a particular party and are considering leaving the conversation. 
  
However, in addition to expressing frustration, this message also contains derisive language and slurring terms that could potentially be offensive. The use the term ""commies"" to describe the opposing political party could offend some people.

"
1963,1963,@USER @USER Antifa members,"While the word ""antifa"" is not considered offensive, its use in this context is derisive. Antifascists are a group of activists who oppose fascism, a far-right political movement. In this tweet the author is making a derision of them by using the term ""ANTifa Members.""

A:
According to this article, Antioch is a small town in California.  It is home to a large community of Antiracists.   The article also says that Antirock is an Antipolitical blog.

Minute my tweets steer towards politics NOTHING goes through!,"While the first half of this tweet contains a criticism of Twitter, specifically the lack of visibility of tweets from the author and a request for the ban on Q FD to have been removed, there is no personal attack or offensive slur in this statement, nor is there any mention of a specific group or individual. 
  
  The second half contains an explanation of how the Twitter ban was removed. This is not a personal criticism, as the removal of such a ban is unlikely to affect the critic's ability to express opinions on politics.

The user then mentions Antifas, another anti fascist group. 
  
This tweet contains explicit language and derogsatory terminology, such as ""left wingnut job"" and ""'de-Funk speaker' Max 'Chaos'ine Watter."" 
   
Additionally, this tweet targets a specific group of people, namely the Anti-fa group: ""the Pillars of Society known..."".

"
1966,1966,@USER @USER @USER Really? It’s been the Dems that have been behind all violence from mass murderers to confrontations to antifa. Wake up,"This tweet contains a single emoji, which is generally considered to not be offensive in and of itself. The context of the emoticons in relation to the rest of this tweet is also not offensive, as it's a humorous criticism of liberals.

"
1967,1967,@USER When will people support Gun control? That's more important. Don't you care about humans life? No,"While the user's tweet does contain some offensive terms and language (e.g. ""inciting"", ""violence"", and ""pissed off""), it also contains a clear call for action and a desire for others to take a stance on an important issue. In addition, it does express concern for human life, but does so in an indirect manner (i.e., by questioning why others don’t care). The overall tone of this tweet suggests that the author is merely expressing their opinion and not trying to incite violence.

"
1968,1968,@USER Thanks for keeping us in your thought and being so kind to fans :cherry_blossom: :red_heart: . Just know this cool cat is gonna drag many great thing into our fans life!,"This tweet does contain a personal attack on another person, in that it refers to the other person as a ""cool cat."" While this is not an offensive term, it can be considered derisive and condescending. 
  
In addition, this tweet contains offensive terms and language. Specifically, ""drag"" and ""into our fan's life."" These terms are considered offensive because they are derrogatory and demeaning.

"
1969,1969,"""@USER @USER @USER And civil rights,"""" like the 'right' to kill your own child transcending a child's right to life...from the same people that insist on more stringent gun control laws to 'save the lives of children.' Let that sink in...""""""","This tweet contains a reference to two groups of people, one being people who support the right of individuals to have the ""right"" to commit murder of themselves and their children, and the second being groups who advocate for stricter gun laws. While the first group is not intended to offend anyone, it is clear from the context of this tweet that the author is making a derisive reference towards the latter group.

"
1970,1970,@USER I think it's more of a choice for ppl to stay hooked on shit,"Offensive language is used in the Tweet. 
  The language used is strong and negative. It is directed at the person who blocked the user and not just a general negative sentiment.  
  It is a personal attack on who the blocked user.

"
1971,1971,@USER Yeaaaahh she is!! &lt;33 URL,"@USER is a Twitter handle of an individual. 
  The term ""fat ass"" is considered derisive and offensive. 
In the last part of this message, @TWEETER mentions that the user in question might be eating nacho in her underwear. This is also considered to be offensive and derrogatory.

"
1972,1972,@USER @USER Whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty... liberals just want Kavanaugh to be guilty because Trump picked him. Get over yourselves,"While the first half of the Tweet is neutral, containing only nonoffensives statements, such as mentioning one dollar and Five dollars, there is an offensive statement in the second half: ""liberals just...want Kavanaugh...to be...guilty because...Trump picked...him"". The word ""just"" is used in an argumentative manner, suggesting that the statement is based on personal preference rather than objective fact. This is highly offensive, as it implies that a person's opinion is more important than the facts. 
  
Although the word is offensive in itself, its context is also important. In the preceding sentence, ""LiberALS"" are being referred to as ""liberal"", which implies they are a group of people who hold liberal views. ""want"" implies a desire to see something happen, and ""Kavanaugh"" suggests that this statement refers to a specific person. Therefore, when combined with ""because Trump selected him"", the offensive meaning of ""Just"" becomes even more apparent.

Small l"""" liberals are their stooges, who don't see they are being used to destroy this country.""""""","This tweet does contain derrogatory slurring, but it is not directed at any specific group. 
  
  The author is merely expressing their opinion on how they feel about liberals. This is a matter of opinion and should not be classified otherwise.

"
1974,1974,@USER @USER Gun control advocacy is itself contrary to the single most important natural right enshrined and protected by our Constitution. ANY attempt to circumvent freedom is radical. See? Simple (and I didn't even have to invent any nonsense words),"Gun control is a controversial topic, and the author is simply expressing his opinion on this topic. He is using nonoffensives words like 'radical', 'contrary', and'single most', but he is still expressing an opinion. 
  
On the other hand, advocating for gun control in a way that is contrary or against the constitution is an offensive act. Therefore, this tweet contains offensive words such as 'fucking', which is used to describe food.

"
1975,1975,@USER @USER needs to get over it. It’s been 5 years since he hasn’t played for the birds. Move on already. There is hardly anyone still on the team from when he played with the Birds. He is starting to sound bitter that he doesn’t have a ring,"While the content of this tweet may be negative, it does express an honest opinion. While the author does sound frustrated with Kaepernick’'s lack of playing time, they are not expressing any personal attack or negative emotion towards the subject. They are simply expressing their opinion that Kapernick needs more playing opportunities. This is a non offensive opinion, and therefore the label of nonoffensiveness is predicted for this prediction.

"
1976,1976,@USER Liberals ruin everything.,"There is nothing derrogatory or negative in this tweet. 
It is merely expressing the user's desire to attend an upcoming event in their area. 
  
  There are no slur terms or language that would be considered offensive.

"
1977,1977,@USER @USER Miriam,"Miriam is an offensive name, so the name of an individual is not considered offensive. 
In the context of this tweet and the user's profile, MirIAM is likely a shortened form or a nickname of another person. In this case, it's likely the original person's real name. 
  In this context, using a person’s real first name is offensive because the practice is known as “first-name-calling.” 
   First-Name-Calling: “First names are a way that people express their feelings and connect with other people. However, some people use first names to call someone out, insult them, make fun of them or otherwise express negative feelings toward them. This type of name- calling is called first- name calling.” - https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-power-emotions/201109/firstnamecaller-psychological-impact
  The original user in this example is someone who engages in firstname calling, as they are using MirIam to insult someone.

"
1978,1978,@USER @USER He is so sweet!,"This tweet does contain offensive slur and derrogatory term, ""URL.""
However, this is a rare occurrence for this user. Based on their other tweets, they tend to use slang or casual language that may be considered offensive by some. In addition, their account has not been verified, so it's possible that this tweet was written by a third party and not the user themselves. As a result, we classified this as a non offense tweet.

"
1979,1979,3. @USER You’re my lil baby and I’m so proud of you for working as hard as you do. Thank you for still being there for me like you are. You’re the sweetest :two_hearts: :two_hearts: don’t ever change,"While the first half of the Tweet is positive, expressing pride in the user's accomplishments, there is a negative sentiment towards the end of it, where the author expresses a desire for the person to not change. This is an example of a nonverbal communication where a positive sentiment is followed by a negation of that sentiment. 
  
In the context of this Tweets, @user is likely a person, as is @POTUS. Therefore, this is not an offensive statement towards a political figure.

"
1980,1980,@USER Double down on rating. Bet NCAA loves this.,"This tweet contains no offensive or inappropriate language. 
It does, however, express an unpopular opinion. 
  The employee in the referenced tweet plays covet on an iPad, which is a personal interest. She does this in free-time. This is not offensive. However, she has an odd phobic of dog, so she is weird.

"
1981,1981,@USER @USER @USER So have the conservatives accepted the antisemitism definition yet?..,"While the definition of antisemitism is not a universally accepted definition, it is generally accepted that antisemisitism is a form of racism, especially against Jews. 
  The definition includes the following elements:
- Delegitimization of Israel
  - Denying Israel's right to exist
    - Calling into question Israel’s right or legitimacy
      - Questioning Israelʼs existence
        - Belief in a Jewish state of Palestine
          - Viewing the existence of the State ofIsrael as a myth

In the context of this Tweet, @USERN doesn't appear to have accepted this definition. Instead, he appears confused about it.

1982,1982,@USER Great news! Old moonbeam Just went into a coma! :face_with_tears_of_joy: ,"This tweet contains no explicit slur, offensive term, nor derrogatory term.

Time to be the vampire and sleep during the day,"This tweet does contain strong and offensive language, but it also expresses empathy and support, addressing a real concern in the community. 
  
  The language is offensive, however, because the individual making the statement is being referred to as ""bitch"" and ""vampire."" These terms are derisive and are not used in a positive way in this context. In addition, ""time to"" is used to express a command, rather than a request, so the language used is also offensive. 
However, this tweet also contains supportive language that is supportive and empathic, encouraging the audience to give the speaker a shot at bringing about positive change.

"
1984,1984,@USER Got a feeling every time deep state complains @USER will punish them with more declass. They are going to pay for their sins! Biglly! Who needs a plan to dump 11k docs and round up crooks? @USER needs to geter done! FNMA FMCC fanniegate EndCorruption LockThemAllUp MAGA,"Offensive language includes derogsatory words, slurs, curse words and other words that are considered to be offensive or inappropriate. 
  
  The term ""deep state"" is derrogatory and offensive, as it implies a group of people are acting in secrecy and are not open to the public's view. 
There is also a negative tone to this tweet that suggests that the individual is angry and frustrated, rather than just expressing amusement at something cute. This is another reason the offensive label was assigned.

"
1985,1985,@USER Antifa boot camp :face_with_tears_of_joy: ,"Antifa is a left-wing extremist group that has committed violent acts. 
  The word ""Antifas"" is slang for ""antifa"" and is used to describe someone who is active in Antifascist work. ""Anti-fascism"" refers to a politics and movement that opposes racism, fascism, and other forms of discrimination and oppression based on these beliefs. Antiracist activists, for example, work to combat racism and its effects. In this context, ""boot camp"" could be a reference to an AntiraCist training camp.

"
1986,1986,@USER Lmfaooooo foh w that free thought shit Lmaoooo,"While the use of the word ""fuck"" is considered crude and offensive, there is also a strong negative feeling towards certain religious groups in the community. This tweet expresses that negative opinion towards Catholics.


TL;DR: Based on this example, Twitter's model does detect offensive language, but it is not always clear from the label itself. In some cases, a predicted offensive label can actually be offensive too. Therefore, be careful when using the offensive prediction label and always check the actual label to understand the context. If you are still not sure, please contact Twitter support. They will be able to help you understand if the prediction is correct or not. 
"
1987,1987,@USER @USER Let's see how many planes are turned around or crazy airport shut downs happen over next few days. Maybe a drinking game? @USER WWG1WGA MAGA,"There is nothing in this tweet that is offensive or derisive. Eliminating offensive words from a tweet can be challenging, but it is possible. In this case, eminem is mentioned in passing, without any derision or negative connotation. Additionally, there is a reference to a ""drinking game"" which is not derrogatory. Finally, although the word ""MAGA"" is often used by users on Twitter to express a deriding or sarcastic tone, in context it does appear to have a positive connotations. 
  
  The use of the exclamation mark in ""WWG 1 WGA!"" is an indicator of sarcasm, which may be derailing the conversation. However, it's not clear that sarcastically exclaiming ""WOW"" would be offensive.

"
1988,1988,@USER @USER We don’t support gun control in Texas. So long Beto!,"This tweet contains a single slur, ""Beto,"" which is a derisive term for Bethesda Softworks' game character, Betrayal at Krondor. Betrothal at Kronor is an award-winning tabletop role-playing game based on Dungeons & Dragons. 
  
Although the term is derrogatory, it is not used in a manner that is offensive or harmful. Rather, this is merely a slang term used by Texas politicians to refer to Betoman, a character in Bete Noire, another table-top game.

1990,1990,@USER @USER @USER How is what she is doin g patriotic? I mean—you’re basically saying it is a political act against the nominee. Like—she waited to come forward until it would cause max damage...I’m not saying she’s lying at all...but what you’re saying is crazy.,"This tweet contains a slur, ""nigger."" 
  
  Slurs are considered offensive. 
   
   The slurred word is used in a derisive way, so it can be considered highly offensive in this context.

  The use or mention that someone is ""waiting to cause maximum damage"" is also considered derrogatory and offensive, as it implies that the person is doing something to intentionally cause harm. This is not the case, however, because the individual is simply voicing their opinion. 
Finally, although the rest of this tweet is generally positive, there is one part that is negative, where the author expresses concern that what the woman is allegedly doing is political. Because the term ""political"" can also be used to describe actions that are not political, this part of his/her/its tweet could also contain offensive content. In summary, while the overall sentiment of what is being said is positive and supportive, some of it contains offensive slang or language. Therefore, we classify this as offensive and do not consider it nonoffensiveness. 

"
1991,1991,@USER Then resign. You have done NOTHING to check El Presidente. You are part of the swamp and hold NO Nebraska values! RESIGN,"This tweet contains a negative opinion of a person who is not offensive. 
  The person in question is Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault during his confirmation process. Many people believe that he was not treated fairly during the process, including many women who have accused him of being sexual assailants. In response to this, many people have called for his resignation. One of these people is user @USERTOM, suggesting that Kavanaugh should resign because he is part the ""swamp"" and holds no ""Nebraska values"". 
   
   This is an opinion, so it would not be considered offensive if it were not for the fact that it contains negative sentiments about the person being discussed.

"
1992,1992,@USER Yes yes Antifa is anti-fascist but celebrate openly when their political opponents are killed. Whatever you guys say.,"This tweet contains no explicit slur or offensive term. However, it does express an attitude that is commonly associated with Antifaschistische Aktion (Antifa), a far-left extremist group. Antihumanism is another common attitude associated Antfasst. This tweet also seems like it is questioning the credibility of someone who is critical of Antifea.

"
1993,1993,@USER @USER @USER As a kid of legal immigrants I can attest you are 100% correct. They follow the law to the letter in most cases because they worked so damn hard to get her legally they won’t do anything to risk their status. The illegals have contempt for our laws and pull the scams 24/7,"In the above tweet the author states that they are a legal immigrant. This is an offensive slur that is used to target a specific group of people based on their membership in the group (legal immigrants). The author does acknowledge that the groups they refer to are illegal immigrants, but the slurs are used in such a way that implies that all legal and illegal immigrant are the same. 
  
  The author also states they were a ""kid of Legal immigrants."" This implies the the speaker is a child of immigrants. Immigrants are an honorable group, however the use here of the word ""legal"" is offensive as the implication is that those who are not legal are less than honorable.

"
1994,1994,"""@USER You know what will make this professor even woker""""? If he's a gun control nut....""""""","This tweet contains derisive slang for people of the Republican party. 
  ""Gun control"" is a slur for conservatives who support gun rights.  
  The professor's statement implies that the NRA is somehow involved in the
quality of his performance as a professor. This is an offensive slant on
the NRA and its members.

"
1995,1995,"""@USER Screw you and that keep up"""" shit honestly :face_with_tears_of_joy: """"""","""Screw"" is a derisive term for ""obligation"" or ""duty."" It is commonly used in an offensive manner, and is therefore considered offensive in this context. 
  
  ""That"" refers to a person or thing. Using ""that"" in reference to another person is generally considered to be offensive, especially when the person being referred to is an elderly person. In this case, FeINSTEIN is the ""That."" 
   
FeINSTINE is Feingold's last name. ""Keep up"" can be considered derrogatory. Additionally, ""shit"" and ""fucking"" are considered profane. Therefore, this tweet contains offensive terms and phrases.

"
1996,1996,@USER @USER shit ode,"While the use and tone of the emoji's may be positive, they are also used to express negative sentiments. For example, ""thumbtack"" is an emoticons that is used as a slang term for ""promote"". The use or tone is negative, and therefore the Tweet is classified offensive:

  @TWTWE: Shit o

1997,1997,@USER that's exactly what his ass gets lmaoo,"@USER is the username of an individual Twitter user. 
lmao is an informal way of expressing laughter or sarcasm. 
  The use here of ""ass"" is offensive because the term is used to describe a person in a derisive way.

"
1998,1998,@USER @USER Corrupt RHINO. Glad he stepped down,"This tweet does not contain any offensive terms or language. 
There is nothing derisive or critical about this tweet; it is merely expressing the opinion that the referenced person stepped aside due to corruption.

"
1999,1999,@USER @USER Why? He is messed up.,"There is a lack of negative or offensive sentiment in the Tweet. 
  The Tweeter is making a joke, expressing a positive sentiment,
  and is acknowledging another user's point. This is not a violation of
   Twitter's rules against abusive behavior.

"
2000,2000,@USER You have to preorder dear she is a preorder bonus in the game,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
It is merely a recommendation for a video game. 
  

However, I would like to point out that the recommendation is for an extremely controversial game that is banned in many countries. This could be a reason why the classification is 'non-neutral'.

"
2001,2001,@USER Shes so old that shes been pushing gun control since the Lincoln assassination.,"This tweet does contain derrogatory content towards a person or a group, but it is not explicit and does appear in context. The user is expressing their opinion on current events and is asking the person mentioned to stop pushing for certain policies. This is an opinion tweet and not an explicit threat. 
  
On the other hand, this tweet contains offensive terms and language towards an individual. ""Shes"" is a derisive term used to refer to someone older than the age of 65. Additionally, ""Lincoln assassination"" refers to a time period in American history where a president was assassinated. These are derOGatory words and terms that can be considered offensive.

"
2002,2002,@USER @USER @USER @USER HE IS THE POORLY EDUCATED!,"This tweet contains a slur against a racial or ethnic group, namely ""poorly educated."" 
  The slurs are not explicit, nor are they derisive. 
   The word is used in a derrogatory way, to describe someone's education. However, without context it's difficult to determine whether the slurred word was used sarcastically or whether it was meant as a criticism.

(Conservatives)""""""","While the UK Independence Party (UKip) tweet contains derisive language towards Theresa Mays leadership, there is no evidence that it targets any individuals or groups based their protected characteristic. 
In the context of this tweet and UKip's platform, ""most Americans"" refers to the general population of Americans, not a group targeted by UKIP.

"
2004,2004,@USER @USER @USER @USER You wanna smoke weed I dont @USER Unlike you I have confidence in myself I don't need a larger government to tell me what tooth paste to use lol But you can always volunteer to pay more taxes? Oddly Liberals are the first one to complain about others not following them,"While the above tweet does contain derrogatory words, they are used in an ironic manner, which is a common technique used to reduce the offensive impact of derogyration. For example, ""oddly"" is used as an adjective describing something that is unusual or unexpected, and is often used ironically to express surprise or to question the logic of someone else's actions. 
  
In addition, although the derogaeration is present in this tweet (e.g. ""You wanna [do something you're not supposed to do] I [don't like you for it]""), it is relatively mild in comparison to other derogiators in that it doesn't contain personal insults or threats. Therefore, this is an example of a derogratory word that can be used without being offensive.

  The theory centers around a deep state conspiracy to remove President Trump from office.  
  It is based on a few key claims:
- There was a massive voter fraud in the 2016 election that benefited Hillary Clinton. 
This is not supported by the evidence. In fact, there is evidence that voter irregularities were more likely to benefit Trump.   

There is also a theory called Qanon, which is similar to Q Ano, except it is believed to be a child porn ring run by pedophiles. This theory is less popular than Qano, and there are no known pedophilia rings that are run in conjunction with the deepstate. However, it does have a cult following, so it may be harder to get away with offensive jokes about pedophilic children.

"
2006,2006,@USER Talk about a kangaroo court! Is this what you Liberals want? One person's word able to destroy another person's life with NOTHING to back it up. If so you're sick.,"This tweet contains offensive words and phrases, such as ""fucking"", ""palate"", and ""kangaroos"".

While the word ""one"" is a reference to a single person, it can also be used to refer to any number of people, and is therefore offensive to many people who consider themselves politically conservative. 
  
  The word 'Liberals' is used as a derisive term towards political groups, rather than a personal insult.

"
2007,2007,@USER You are perfect :OK_hand: ,"In the original tweet the word ""OK"" is used as an emoji. While emojis are not considered words in and of themselves, they are often used to convey a sentiment. In this case, ""ok"" can be interpreted as ""all right"" or ""good"" and is therefore considered neutral. 
  
However, if the emoticons were not used, this tweet would have been considered offensive. ""Ok"" could be considered derisive or even a slur against people with disabilities.

This is highly offensive and violates Twitter's rules against abusive behavior.

"
2010,2010,@USER @USER SHE IS THREATENING AMERICAN CITIZENS SHE WILL KILL WOMEN ARREST HER,"While the content of the Tweet is negative, there is no explicit threat of violence or harm. However, by mentioning the name of an individual who is allegedly a threat to American citizens, and by using the word ""she,"" the author is implicitly threatening violence against that individual. 
  
  The use of slang and derisive language is also offensive, as it targets an entire group based on their perceived stereotypical traits.

2011,2011,McCaskill campaign hit with report on husband's federal subsidy windfall URL Mccaskill Kavanaugh ChristineBlaseyFord ThursdayThoughts MAGA,"While the URL is potentially offensive, there is no derisive or negative tone to the text, so the label of offensive is not applicable. 
  
  The text is about a campaign attack, not about the candidate. There is nothing derrogatory or personal about it. 
There is also no explicit hate language in it, although it could be seen as offensive if it was written by a member of a group that is often stereotyped as being hateful.

"
2013,2013,@USER If she is close by I don’t mind checking in on her. I’m in Greenville NC,"This tweet does contain a positive sentiment, and the person is simply asking another user for information, so it would be considered offensive if the other user was critical of them. 
  
  The user does appear to have a sense of humor, as they are making a reference to a popular TV show.

"
2014,2014,@USER No doubt she is proud of her daughter from Heaven! So sorry for your loss (at such a young age) How difficult it must have been &amp; I imagine to a certain degree still must be...She sounds as a truly wonderful person. You are her legacy!,"While the use and context of certain words and phrases may offend some people, there is nothing in the text that is targeted towards anyone based on their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, veteran status, disability status or other characteristic. 
  
  The text is positive and does nothing to denigrate the person who passed away.

"
2015,2015,@USER This reminds me of conservatives wanting to know if Monica was on her back or her knees. Is it really needed to decide these guys are sleeze bags?,"Monica is a character on a TV show Friends. The quote is comparing the conservative party's desire to find out if a woman is on all fours or on top, to a sleazy bag. This is an offensive comparison, so the quote was classified in this category.

It like they miss that part .,"While the first tweet might seem critical and offensive, its context and the context of the other tweets make clear that the author is just expressing his opinion and is not targeting any individuals or groups. 
  
  The second tweet seems like a reasonable request for respect from the law enforcement perspective. However, this is an opinion, and not a factual statement that can be classified.

"
2017,2017,@USER @USER It’s weird how conservatives sometimes get accused of lacking empathy.,"Conservatives are not a protected class in this context. 
There is nothing offensive in the statement ""Cons conservatives."" 

 

A:

I would say that the offensive part of the label offensive is the part about conservatives.  The rest of it is just a comment on how the user feels about the subject.

2018,2018,Lebron amazing swallow clear beat deplorables can't believe MAGA scott adams,"LeBron James is a well-known basketball player. He is known for his
athleticism and ability to dunk on opponents. 
  Based off of this information, it is possible to conclude that LeBron
James is an athlete. Athlete's are known to have the ability
to dribble, pass, shoot, etc. and are generally considered to
behave in an offensive manner, as opposed to a defensive manner
(i.e. playing defense). 
   Based upon this, along with the profane language, this tweet could be
considered to contain offensive content.

2019,2019,.@USER As my elected MP could you please explain why @USER is still promoting ideas that the EU have already rejected? We've 6 months to go and nothing appears to be moving onward. @USER are like the blind leading the blind brexitshambles BrexitMeansBrexit URL,"While the Tweet does contain derisive language and personal attack, this is not the main reason the label was classified non offensive. Rather, a closer look at the text reveals that it is actually a criticism of a politician's lack of knowledge on an important topic. In particular, @user is criticizing a member of parliament for promoting views that have been rejected by the European Union. 
  
  The EU has already stated that they will not consider any proposal that would allow for the automatic revocation of EU citizenship for dual nationals who leave the union. Given that @USERN has repeatedly promoted the idea of revoking citizenship in order to prevent dual citizens from serving on US courts, his views have also been explicitly rejected.

"
2020,2020,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Thank God they ban conservatives on social media.,"While the Tweet contains derisive language and makes light of a serious issue, there is no explicit or implicit content that would be deemed offensive. 
  
  The Tweeter is a private citizen, and the author of this TWEET has not been identified. As such, we cannot provide any further context or explanation.

"
2021,2021,@USER A nothing burger..,"This tweet does contain derrogatory or negative language, but it's not directed at any particular group. 
  
  The language is offensive, though not in an explicit way. ""Nothing burger"" is an offensive term used to describe something that is not particularly good.

"
2022,2022,@USER @USER He is virtue signaling playing with young minds. He also thinks he can weaponise it in an attempt to stop Brexit. @USER is a disgraceful vile man to be honest he doesn't care who or what he uses to get what he wants.,"Virtue signaling is an insidious form of signaling that is meant to appear as a positive trait. Signaling is when an individual, group, organization, etc. uses an outwardly positive behavior or trait as an indicator of their positive internal state. For example, a person who wears a pink shirt to work to signal their support for women's rights. This outward display of support is intended to make the person appear to have a more positive attitude than they actually do. However, signaling can also be used as negative behavior, where the individual is trying to convey a negative attitude or intent. 
  
In this case, @user is signaling their approval of Antifas and their desire to bring them into the GOP party, while at the same time, they are trying (unsuccessfully) to convince the reader that they can identify Antiffas by their clothing or behavior. In reality, Antiffany is attempting to manipulate the system to gain access to the Republican party and is using Antifiasm as part a strategy to do so.

The question to ask is not ‘how to change their minds?’ but ‘how to win elections?’ valuinghealth2018,"This tweet does express love and support to a user, however it also contains derisive language towards a group of people, which is offensive. The derision is towards white people and Christian people which are not positive messages to send to someone who has experienced a loss.

"
2024,2024,@USER @USER You go Mike and by the way Sarah she is the best lair . URL,"@USER is an account that has recently been created on Twitter. 
Mike is not a person, but a Twitter handle that was used in this example. 
  
Sarah is another Twitter account. This account has a history of engaging with users on social media platforms, and has also been labeled as offensive.

"
2025,2025,@USER How taser works?,"Offensive language: the word ""taser"" is considered offensive because of its derisive use in a negative context. 
  
Negative sentiments: there is nothing negative in the original tweet about tasers, so this factor does nothing in determining whether the prediction is offensive or not.

"
2026,2026,@USER Happy Birthday Delaney! I hope you are enjoying college and we miss you.,"Delaney is the name of a fictional character on a TV show. 
She is not a real person.

It does express disagreement about something the author believes to have been said, but it is not clear that the statement was meant to attack a person based their personal characteristics. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter's TOS, you can't use the service to promote violence. So, I think the classification is correct.

"
2028,2028,@USER You do mean the bernie assholes that stayed home,"Bernie Sanders supporters who stayed at home in 2016 were perceived by the author of the Tweet as being responsible for Hillary Clinton's election loss. 
  
This is an example of negative stereotyping, where a person or a category of people is stereotyped and judged negatively. Negative stereotypical judgments can have a variety of causes, including but not limited to:
- Prejudice or discrimination against the group
  - The author may have had a negative experience with a member of that group, and is projecting that experience onto the entire group 
Negative stereotype of Bernie Sanders' supporters as ""bums"" is offensive because the word ""bums"" has a derisive connotation that is not generally associated with Bernie Sander's supporters.

"
2029,2029,@USER @USER Tell B Coach Fulk says hi! Miss that kid! He is a shot blocker!,"@USER is asking a question about the source of a claim. This is not an offensive question, and the user has provided a link to a page that supports the claim they are asking about. 
B Coach Fulks is an alias used by a user. 
  The user does mention FULK in their tweet and it does appear to be a reference to him. However, it's not clear to me from the context of this tweet whether the reference is to Coach or to the username. If Coach, then the question is answered. But if the Coach is another user, I don't think the mention of Coach in this context is offensive.

"
2030,2030,@USER So much respect for that man wherever he is. :red_circle: :white_circle: ,"This tweet simply expressed the opinion of a user that another person is an 'amazing and love'S soul'. It did not express any personal attacks or offensive terms towards the other person.

Note that this answer is based on a single tweet and may not be applicable to all cases.

2032,2032,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Socialists politics that stand up for the downtrodden. And well done for conflating criticism of Israel with anti semitism. You are also part of the problem.,"While the first tweet may be critical, it also does contain some personal attack towards Ivana, and therefore it could be considered offensive. However, this is difficult to determine from the text alone, so it would be useful to see the context of this tweet. 
In the second tweet the user mentioned is being criticized for criticizing Israel. This is not an unusual criticism, especially in the current political climate. Therefore, I do not consider this to constitute an offensive statement.

Then there is the spiritual birth which is obviously when we spiritually die to our sinful flesh and be reborn sinless after being cleansed by His blood at salvation when our sin debt is paid! Praise God,"This tweet does contain offensive terms, such as'starvation' and'sin'. However the term 'praise god' is used in the context of a religious discussion, and is therefore not considered to be offensive. 
  
  The user in this case is expressing their gratitude for the clarification given, without using any personal slurs or attacking any individual. It is a non offensive tweet.

"

Funny how questions never went anywhere with Trudeau.,"In this tweet the author expresses their skepticism about the effectiveness of a movement called metOO, however they do not use any offensive slur or derrogatory terms to express their opinion. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter's guidelines, offensive terms should be flagged for review by the team.  In your case, they decided that the term ""lumpen"" was offensive and removed it from the Tweet.

In this context, 'public sector' is used as a slur to refer to the Conservative party, and 'thinking' indicates that this is an example of 'think tank' thinking, a derisive term for conservative think tanks. 
  
Although the content of this tweet may be offensive, because it targets a specific political party using a pejorative term, makes derision of another person's work, contains offensive slang, uses offensive gender-specific language ( 'woman','starvation'), and is otherwise offensive in nature, its tone and context make it not offensive.

"
2038,2038,@USER @USER American terrorists. We need strict punishment for these lawless thugs. STOP powdering Antifa’s ass. BackTheBlue :blue_heart: :black_heart: gettough,"In the first tweet the user expresses concern that Americans should be gun-free. 
  This is an offensive statement as it encourages violence against Twitter users who support President Trump.  

Secondly, in response to the above tweet he expresses support for stricter punishment of American law-breakers. However, he does so by using derisive terms such as ""powdering"" and ""ass"". This is offensive as he is using personal insults to express support.

"
2039,2039,@USER BigBossTamil Looks like Janani has figured out she is not going to win but just focusing on ending the game with dignity and finesse. She seems too resigned and not much enthusiasm in anything. Does anyone feel that way?,"While the text does contain some offensive words, they are used in a derisive manner. For example, ""resigned"" is used to describe someone who is calm and collected, and ""not muchenthusiasm"" describes someone as being unenthused or apathetic. 
  
However, even with the offensive content, this tweet still conveys a nonoffensiveness. The text describes the current state of the player, Janan, who appears resigned, not very enthusiastic, nor very passionate about the outcome of her match. This is an accurate portrayal of how most players will likely feel after losing a match, so it cannot be considered offensive.

"
2040,2040,@USER @USER The truth of it is that unless she has evidence than it's only allegations! If there is no proof than it is only 'what she says' against 'what he says'! She doesn't get marks for truthfulness just because she is a woman; because women can lie just as quickly as a man can!,"This tweet is an example of a non offensive statement of opinion. Although the language is speculative, there are no derrogatory or offensive terms used. Furthermore, although the statement is directed at a specific person, Feingold is referenced in the third person. This indicates that it was likely written by a third party and not directed specifically at Feigold.

"

According to this tweet classification model, ""offense"" is the most likely class for this Tweet.  The model is using the Twitter Topic Model to classify Tweets as part of an effort to predict the likelihood of those T tweets being offensive or not.   The T-Square model uses a combination of TF-IDF weighting on words in a TWEET and a logistic regression model to determine the probability that a given T tweet will be offensive, based on a training set of T weblogs and their corresponding labels.

A:
According to this tweet classification model, ""bad chaId"" is a derisive term for someone who is ""a bad chai"".  The model is not aware of any actual history of this term being used to refer to someone with a mental illness.  It is possible that this is an error in this model.

2046,2046,@USER 'Why people who are a particular leaning?' - this implies that there is a specific effort against conservatives which I have not seen any actual evidence of. (Presidential tweets and cherry picking tweets do not count),"There is the implication in this tweet that conservatives are being targeted by a government effort, but there's no evidence to support this claim. 
Conservatives are not a protected class, so the offensive nature of the statement is not based off of their protected status.

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, offensive terms should be flagged as offensive.  The following is an excerpt from the guidelines: 
Offensive language
Language that is sexual, racist, homophobic, xenophobe, hateful or otherwise offensive will not be tolerated and will be removed. This includes content that: is blatantly offensive; is used in a way that evokes a negative response from others; or is otherwise inappropriate.

2050,2050,@USER @USER @USER People don't seem to know about these organizations or understand their scheme. It's anti-freedom tuition fees and Antifa piggy banks. Need more people to denounce it and make students aware of it so they can vote to stop funding them.,"This tweet contains a slur, ""antifa,"" which is offensive and derrogatory. However, even though the word is derisive, its use in the context of a political argument is a legitimate topic of public debate. 
  
  The author of this tweet was expressing concern that people do not understand the organizations mentioned in Goodells' tweet. This is an important point to consider when making a prediction. If the author had not mentioned these concerns, we might have classified this as offensive.

"
2051,2051,@USER We should all believe Feinstein because she is so upstanding. She would never hir a spy from China and employee them for over 10 years. She needs to resign. TRADER.,"While the use offensive language towards individuals is not condoned, there is nothing derrogatory or personal in the Tweet. 
  The Tweeter is expressing his opinion and does so in a sarcastic manner. He is also expressing support of Feingold's decision to call for her resignation.

"
2052,2052,@USER @USER Hollywood and media make jokes about Jesus and Christians and think that's hilarious but turn every innocent joke conservatives tell in to an outrage. Typical of reprobates.,"In the context of the Tweet, ""Jesus"" and ""Christians"" are both nonoffensively used as a humorous reference. 
  
  The Tweeter is expressing his opinion that the media and Hollywood make light of jokes made by conservatives, and that this is offensive. He is using ""reprobate"" as an adjective to describe the behavior of those who do not understand the offense that is being committed.

"
2053,2053,@USER ANCIENT HOMIES COULDNT HAVE COCK COCKS FIGHTING BECAUSE THAT WAS LITERALLY ILLEGAL IN ATHENS FJSHDHJS,"This tweet contains derisive language and personal attack. Derisory language is generally considered offensive. Personal attack is also considered to have offensive connotations. 
  
  The use and context of certain words and phrases in this tweet are also offensive, such as ""ancient homies"", ""fjshdhjs"", and ""cock"". 
   
In addition, this is a prediction model and not a human reviewer. Therefore, it is possible that the model misinterpreted the context or used offensive terms in its analysis.

"
2054,2054,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER You just said publicly aligns with neo Nazis. I asked which and you can’t answer got it. Source for your “ambush tactics” please. By your definitions I’m not sure you know what a paramilitary is. Do you classify Antifa as paramilitary?,"This tweet contains a reference to neo-Nazi groups, a topic that can cause offense to many people, even if the reference is inaccurate. 
  
  The language in the body of this Tweet is offensive, as the word ""got"" is a derisive term used to describe someone who is easily tricked. Additionally, ""ambushing"" someone is also considered to be offensive. 
Finally, although the Tweeter is clearly expressing their opinion, they are also using aggressive tactics to do so, including asking for a source for their claims. This is an example of ""trolling"" and can also be seen as offensive behavior.

"
2055,2055,@USER A whore's book being published! All the looney liberals run out and buy it,"Offensive language includes words like ""faggot"", ""retard"", and ""pussy"".

Non-Offensiveness does NOT include derisive language, especially when it's used to criticize a group of people.

"
2056,2056,@USER @USER I would have thought a nazi incel spunktrumpet like Shapiro WOULD actually feel rage about an Antifa film.,"@user is a Twitter handle that I followed.

Along with another 30-40% lower court appointments. The democrat destruction over the last 10 years has been epic!! And hilarious. maga,"While the first part of this tweet contains a few curse words, they are not offensive. 
  The rest of it contains some mild profanity, which is not considered offensive in and of itself. However, there is also no explicit language that is offensive, so it's hard to say whether this is an offensive tweet or not.

"
2058,2058,@USER @USER It's like some people are acting like ANTIFA... :thinking_face: :thinking_face: :thinking_face: ,"This tweet does contain an explicit insult, namely ""ANTifa"". The word is widely considered to have negative connotations and is often used as a slur to refer to left-wing activists. However, in this context, it was used in the description of the group's activities, rather that as an insult directed at the individual user. 
  
In addition, although the word ""antifa"" is offensive, its use in combination with other words does help to identify the context of this tweet. For example, ""thinking face"" can refer either to a person who is acting in an exaggerated manner or to someone who has a particular expression on their face. In this case, given the tone of both the preceding and succeeding tweets, we believe that ""anti-fascist"" was the intended meaning.

"
2059,2059,@USER @USER @USER If you think billionaires are truly liberal than you are the fool. They are playing their part in public but if they were truly Liberals homelessness would end. You are being played like a fiddle,"While the first half of this tweet contains a statement of opinion, which is protected speech, its second half contains an explicit call to violence, targeting the individual mentioned in the second part of speech. This is an example of incitement to riot, a criminal offense. 
  
  The user who sent the original tweet also sent a follow-up tweet that contained a link to a news article about an incident in which a protester was arrested for incendiary threats against a business. That tweet was also classified offensive, and the classification was upheld by the community.

"
2060,2060,@USER hope you are having a great day honey. Can't wait to talk to you :grinning_face_with_big_eyes: I love you :two_hearts: :face_blowing_a_kiss: ,"This tweet contains a personal attack on a person or organization. 
  ""I love"" is not a neutral sentiment. It is an expression of love, but it can also be a form of flattery. In this case, it could be interpreted as an insult, as the user doesnot appear to have a strong feeling towards the person mentioned in the text. 
""Grinningen"" could also mean ""grinned,"" a slang term for ""cheeky"" or ""joking"" that is often used by young people to insult someone. This could lead to the interpretation that the author does indeed have an unfavorable opinion of that person.

"
2061,2061,@USER Can we all stop pretending that the Catholic Church is not the seat of Satan on earth?,"This tweet contains no explicit hate or offensive terms or images. 
It is a lighthearted comment about the Church's teachings on sin. 
  The Church has a lot of power and influence, so it is natural to question its teachings.

"

Why use fear? How help you? USA doing GREAT. THAT helps! Vote FOR YOUR/FAMILY LIFE FOR GOOD! CCOT URL,"There is nothing offensive in this tweet; it simply expresses a congratulation and encouragement to someone for achieving something. 
  
  The use the emojis clap and light-skin-tone are nonoffensives. They simply express congratulations and positive sentiments.

"
2063,2063,@USER @USER @USER @USER Well he’s complimenting her body which she is clearly very proud of as she’s naked in every episode,"This tweet does contain derrogatory words, such as ""naked,"" ""proud,"" and ""body,"" but they are used in a nonoffensiveness context. For example, ""she's naked"" is a derisive way of saying someone is showing their private parts, while ""he's complimented her"" refers to someone praising someone else's qualities. 
  
Additionally, this tweet contains a slur, referring to African Americans as a group, without the slurred word being used derisorily. ""Body"" can also be derided, as it can refer to a person as being overweight. However, in this context, it's clear that the word is being spoken in derision of a body type, rather then as an insult. 
Overall, although the derogy language is offensive, its context makes it non offensives.

"
2064,2064,@USER @USER The purrfect portrait! She even has her tail wrapped around her paws! She is beautiful in this shot!,"In the first tweet the user is accused of incitement of violence against Twitter users who support President Trump. This is considered an offensive accusation and the language used is derrogatory. 
However, in the second tweet it is suggested that the image of a cat with its tail around its paWS is ""beautiful"". This could be interpreted as a compliment, so the classification of this tweet as being non offensive is difficult.

"
2065,2065,@USER @USER Oh she is doing that all by herself,"This tweet contains no explicit slur, insult, racial epithet, etc. and does nothing to target an individual. 
  The user simply expressed skepticism about someone’s involvement in past events.

"
2066,2066,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Be best. Be MAGA :check_mark_button: Following amazing patriots.,"While the use of the word ""MAGA"" is considered offensive by some, this tweet does contain derisive remarks about the users mentioned in the preceding paragraph, but it also contains no offensive words or slurring. Furthermore, although the sentiment of this message is negative, there is no personal attack or use offensive terms.

"
2067,2067,"""@USER I do remember. :( But somehow centrist"""" antifa-haters can never quite seem to bring themselves to condemn such things.""""""","""centrist"" is an adjective describing someone or something. In this case, it describes the opinion expressed in the Tweet. 
antifa- haters is another adjectival phrase describing the people who were mentioned in this TWEET. 
  The phrase antifas can be used as an insult to refer to people or groups who are associated with the far-right. However, in context of this tweet it was used in a positive way to express that the group of people mentioned could not bring itself to fully condemn certain actions.

"
2068,2068,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER not what the conclusions says in the paper. do you know what experiments they did? you are just like an creationist that blindly believe what the news says. You are like an catholic that beliees every word of the pope.,"This tweet contains profanities and offensive terms. 
It is addressing a pattern in behavior that is being repeated by certain users, namely the users repeating the offensive statements. 
  The language is therefore noncomplimentary and nonoffensiveness is the most likely prediction.

"
2069,2069,"""@USER @USER (1) Ok lets play this game. Which side"""" is openly advocating for the persecution of a race &amp; promoting segregation? Which is supporting a militant group very similar to Hitlers brown shirts (Antifa)? Which is calling for gun control (even wanted armbands)?""""""","This tweet contains a reference to Hitler's Brown Shirts, a group of paramilitary police officers in Nazi Germany. Antifa is a radical leftist group that advocates for violent revolution and the overthrow of the government. The Antifas slogan is ""Arms Off Our Streets."" Antisemitic propaganda was used by the Nazis during World War II. 
  
In the context of this tweet the word ""side"" is being used in a derisory manner to refer to the political parties. In this context, ""support"" and ""advocating"" are being interpreted as synonymous with ""siding with"" or ""supporting."" The word side is not being applied to any specific party or person.

"
2070,2070,@USER I have long thought that liberals are children trapped in adult bodies.,"Offensive content: ""Adult"" body, ""adult"" language
Language that targets individuals or groups: derrogatory slur, explicit slush, offensive terms

"
2071,2071,@USER Because liberals hate America and cant stand the thought of a successful country,"Liberals hate success and want to see America fail. 
  The statement contains no explicit slur or offensive term, but it could still be considered offensive.

"
2072,2072,"... a bunch of self-aggrandizing liberals in fancy dresses mocking Trump.” Except for the fancy dresses, sounds a lot like the Dems who are trying to lynch Kavanaugh... politics MeTooWitchhunt URL","In the first part of the quote, ""self-agggrandizement"" is used to describe liberals. This is an offensive term because liberals are not self aggrandizers. 
  
  In addition, in the second part, a ""lynch mob"" refers to Democrats who have been trying for years to bring down a Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. However, this term is also offensive because Democrats are attempting to do this for political reasons, not because they actually believe he is guilty of sexual assault. 
Finally, although the last part is a URL, Twitter does allow users to include profane language in their tweets. Therefore, we cannot classify this as non offensive, even though it contains profanities.

URL,"While the content of the Tweet is related to political opinion and action, there is no explicit language that is offensive or that targets a group of people based their protected characteristic. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter's TOS, you can not endorse or support any particular candidate or party. So, this tweet violates the terms of service.

"
2074,2074,@USER 2011 I still got all my shits URL,"Offensive language: ""shit"" is a derisive term used to refer to something that is inferior or of low quality. 
  
  Offensiveness: While the term ""shits"" can be considered derrogatory in some contexts, its use in a tweet that encourages people not to support a political party is more likely to be perceived as nonoffensve.

"
2075,2075,@USER Why is Antifa upset w/ “prof.” Blasé-Ford? Antifa is the group that harrasses &amp; threatens people at their homes.,"Antifa, short for Anti-fascist, is a left-wing activist group. Their website states that they ""foster solidarity with the working class against the far right"" and that their members ""harass and threaten people who oppose them."" The Antifaschistische Aktion, or ""Antifascists Action,"" website includes a list of ""typical targets"" of Antifiascism, including ""prof."" Blase Ford, a survivor of domestic violence, who was recently nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. 
  
In the last paragraph of the Tweet, Tina is mentioned. Based on this mention, Antifea is upset with Blasing Ford for being nominated a ""Prof.""

2076,2076,@USER Hi I am Tim Kaine and this is my Criminal Antifa Son :thumbs_up: URL,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
It is not expressing a personal attack on Kanye West or his family. 
 It is an expression of gratitude towards KANYE WEST for supporting the Democratic Party.

I already know a double standard exists. I don’t know how you can question it.,"While the Tweet does contain some offensive words, they are used in a humorous context. Therefore, this tweet does fall into a category that is not considered offensive on TikTok.

"
2079,2079,ANTIFA..ANONYMOUS ARE COMING FOR YOU.. URL,"ANTifa is an anti-fascist activist group that has taken credit for a number of violent attacks on far-right groups. 
  The group has also been linked to other violent acts, including the murder of a journalist. 
AnTIFA is short for ""Anti-Fascists against the Fascist attack on working class people.""
  Anonymity is one of their core values, and they do not wish to disclose their identity. They have also attacked journalists for publishing their names.

"
2080,2080,@USER @USER @USER I don’t think he is a sociopath. I think he knows what he did and he knows he is lying.,"In this tweet the author expresses their opinion that the president is aware of what is happening and is just lying to cover it up. This opinion is based in part on information from the book 'The Art of the Deal' by Donald Trump. 
  
This opinion does contain some offensive terms, namely the use of'sociopath' to describe the President. Sociopath is considered to be a derisive term for someone with a personality disorder. In this context, it is likely used to refer to the fact that Trump has a history of lying and has no regard for others' feelings.

"
2081,2081,@USER he is small and he needs someone BIG to clear the beach for him,"This tweet uses a humorous analogy to describe the size of a person. While the analogy is humored, there is nothing offensive in it. 
  
  The use of emojis in this tweet (such as face with joy and :heart:) is also nonoffensiveness.

"
2082,2082,@USER I got this,"This tweet contains no offensive or abusive language, nor does it target any individuals or groups based their protected characteristic. 
It is a general opinion based solely on a perception of a pattern in behavior.

By saying that Skip should start a Twitter account and become an expert on Twitter, @user is suggesting that @skip should stop being a coder and a person and instead become another professional Twitter user. While it's possible that this tweet could be considered offensive, it does contain a positive sentiment and is not intended to cause harm.

"
2084,2084,@USER I said the same thing today lol,"This tweet does contain offensive content, but the content is in response and not the original tweet. It is therefore not covered by the ""not offensive"" label. 
@user: ""Eminems did not mention any offensives language in his tweet""

However, this is incorrect. In the Tweet, E minem does mention offensive words such as ""lie"", ""sucking"", and ""Obama"". 
 @user @em: ""@USER ""@EMINEM @EMinem @USEREminam did mention some offensive terms in this tweet.""
 @Em: ""'lie','suck', and 'Obama' are offensive, not to mention 'open your eye' is an insult.""

2085,2085,@USER Be still. And know you are being prayed for . URL,"While the content of the Tweet may not be offensive, there is a strong negative sentiment towards the person mentioned in the text. The user is being referred to as a ""joke"" and is not being thanked for sharing their content.

"
2086,2086,"""@USER Be patient with us we have autism"""" Cap!""""""","This tweet contains a slur, autism, and is therefore offensive. 
However, it does mention the autism aspect in order to explain the delay in Tyler's reaction. Therefore, this tweet can be considered offensive but not as offensive as the first tweet. 
  
  The slurred word is not offensive, however the entire sentence is offensive and should not have been posted.

However, although the words used are strong, they do not express explicit slur or harassment, nor do they contain derisive terms or offensive phrases. The word ""crazy"" is often used to describe someone who is mentally unstable, and the word is therefore not considered derrogatory. 
  
Although the text contains negative language towards John F. Kerry, this does little to explain the offensive nature of this tweet. In fact, most of it is simply expressing the opinion that Kerry is a poor candidate for president. As such, while the tone of some of these words is negative, their use is neither deriding nor offensive.

"
2088,2088,@USER I always strike lawyers. I served on a jury (civil) and the jury wanted me to decide the case and kept asking me to explain jury instructions. My take away is that the lawyer may hold too much sway in deliberations. But if he or she is on your side.....,"This tweet does contain derisive language and offensive terms. The use of the words ""strike"" ""sway"" are derrogatory and have a negative connotation. Additionally, ""lawyer"" is a derogaous term and ""side"" has a pejorative connotations. 
  
However, this tweet also contains a clear request for further clarification. In addition, there is no context to the use or meaning of these words, so it would be difficult to determine their intended meaning without context. Therefore, based on this information, we classified this as a non offensive tweet.

"
2089,2089,@USER I seems Hannity has been a client of the Bunny Bar (at the Bunny Ranch) for years (30+). He (allegedly) recruits Fox ‘talent’ and guest speakers from there. URL,"This tweet contains a reference to a BDSM-related website. While the website is not illegal, some people find references to BDsM offensive. 
  
  The reference is to an article about the owner of a website that caters to people who like to engage in BdsM. In the article, a former employee of that website describes how the former owner would often recruit Fox News personalities to speak at his events. This is a topic that is of interest to many people, but some find BsM to be offensive, so this may have contributed to this tweet being classified non offensive

A:
According to Twitter's TOS, they will not allow you to post content that: 
""is hateful, threatening, abusive, or otherwise objectionable""
In this case, I think the Tweet is just a playful jab at the Fox personality.  It's not hate speech, nor is it threatening.

  The group is notoriously violent and has even been linked to the murder of an American journalist. Antifa has also been accused of using violence against right-wing protesters. In the past, they've been labeled as a terrorist organization by the FBI. 
Hnh is an acronym for ""hate no more."" It is used by far left groups to express their opposition to hate groups. It has become a popular slogan among antifascists. However, ""H nh"" is also a slur used to refer to white people, which is why the group exposed the URL of the Facebook group to identify the users.

  The username is often used in Twitter username spoofing. URL is part of the Twitter profile picture.  

In this case, @IGN is following both accounts. @IggleSoup has a username that is similar to @ign, so @Ign is also following @iggyssoup. Iggle is known to be a fan of Em, who is one of IGGY's favorite artists. So @User is trying say @user is saying that @iggysoups can outperform @em because they are younger.

Personal attacks include statements like the one in the example, where the author is making a negative comment about the other user without any evidence to back up their claim. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offense"" is defined as ""verbal aggression that targets another person based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, and/or any other classification that is perceived as a basis for discrimination.""
In this case, I would say that the offensive statement is ""you niggers"", which can be considered a racial slur.

Rather, this is an attempt to understand the context of a statement made by the author. 
  
Although the statement ""Kerry doesn’t have  a clue"" may be somewhat offensive, its meaning is clear and does  not contain offensive terms or language. In context, ""he doesn""t  have a  clue"" can mean either that the person in question does have an answer, but is too embarrassed to share it, or that they do not have the information necessary to provide an accurate answer.

"
2097,2097,@USER How dare you tell me what Antifa is doing is right. They are not fighting facism they are fighting for their own stupid cause. They are further from fixing facism than the republicans themselves,"Antifa, as a hashtag, is associated with far-left extremism and violence. 
  The user's statement that ""they are [not] fighting fascism"" is offensive because it implies that Antifas are actually fighting against fascist organizations. Antigovernment groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan, are considered fascists by the government and many people. This is a slur against the group of people who have been historically oppressed by governments.

"
2098,2098,@USER Why do all liberals look like they're eating sour grapes??,"This tweet contains a humorous analogy about how liberals and Democrats look, based off the perceived behavior and appearance of sour (or tart) grapes. 
  
  The analogy is not derisive or offensive, and the language is generally informal. However, it implies that sour or tart grapes are a stereotypical trait of liberals or Democrats, rather than a result of their actual dietary preferences. This is a non offensive analogy.

"
2099,2099,@USER But... But... BOTH PLAYERS WERE WOMEN. And BOTH WERE WOMEN OF COLOR!,"Both the users in this example are expressing opinions about an issue that is a matter of public debate. Both users are disagreeing with each other, and the disagreement is expressed in an nonoffensve manner using emoticons and other nonverbal cues. 
  
  The user who is being thanked is not offended by the discussion, as he is responding to another user with a positive response. He is simply expressing his opinion that this is an appropriate topic for discussion.

2100,2100,@USER Nobody is addressing the cow in the room. Not even when Florence is still doing her thing. It's like after a mass shooting and it's the wrong time to talk about gun control. @USER,"A:

I don't think the word ""cow"" is offensive.  It's a common slang term for a female.

Peaceful because the right ..Well..know they're right. No counter protests. Unlike fascist Antifa. As for 7k .. who counted? Dianne Abbott???,"This tweet contains no explicit slur or offensive term. 
It is a non sequitur, but it does relate to the conversation. 
  The use the word ""fascist"" is not intended to offend anyone. Fascism is an authoritarian political ideology that is often associated with racism, antisemitism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, Islamophobia and xenophobia. Antifas is the acronym for Anti-Fascists, a group that opposes fascism. In this context, ""antifascism"" can mean opposing fascists.

"
2102,2102,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Like unemployed LibLeft Antifa SJW parent basement dwellers...,"the tweet contains no offensive or disrespecting language
it is a hypothetical opinion based on current political situations
and it is unlikely to have any harmful consequences.

"
2103,2103,@USER I wish I was a short as you. OOF. Im just as tall as Okabe and you are a size of R/Luka. lol URL,"While the length of the URL is an issue, there are no explicit references to physical attributes or size. In addition, Okabayashi is clearly a much larger person than Luka, so the comparison is fair. 
  
  The language is critical and strong, but does it cross the line into being offensive? The language includes slang terms and references specific groups. For example, ""Farrakahn's hatefull and racists thugms"" includes references both to Black Lives Matter and to Minister Farrah Khaam of The Nation of Islam. There is nothing in the Tweet that directly targets or attacks any individuals or uses explicit racial slur. However, because this is the first Tweets the account has posted, we cannot be certain that the slangs and groups referenced are the only ones the author is aware of.

"
2104,2104,@USER @USER Where does Mrs May get her 'cunning plans' from? URL,"Mrs May is not a person, so the use of her first name is irrelevant. 
'Mrs' is an informal form of address, used by both men and women, for or to a woman. 
  Using 'Mrs.' to refer to the Prime Minister is standard practice.

"
2105,2105,@USER @USER @USER Feinstein needs to go. Her husband should be investigated for his China deals and the Post Office deals. She is conflicted and this is below dignity,"This tweet contains a derisive remark about Senator Dianne Feinstien's husband, who is a prominent businessman. 
  
  The remark is not directed at any individual, group, political affiliation, race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, age or ethnicity. 
Feinsten is an American politician who has represented California in the United States Senate since 2013.

"
2106,2106,@USER what the fuck do you gain from posting on your private instead of your public,"This tweet contains explicit slur words, such as ""retard"" and ""faggot"".

It also contains negative implications and assumptions about a person, namely that they are mentally unstable and gain something from being private. 
  
  These could offend some people.

"
2107,2107,@USER @USER @USER The most ironic thing is. The dems hasten their own demise while empowering their executioners.

This is because the author is criticizing the Democratic Party for allegedly hastening its own downfall by empowerING its executioner's, and the Republican Party, for supposedly doing the same thing to the other. 
  
  The author of that tweet was a member of Antifas, a far-left terrorist organization.

"
2108,2108,@USER Law enforcement gets to carry around semi-automatic guns and make judgment calls about who lives and who dies based solely on race and appearance. Gun control arguments NEVER EVER take into account police brutality.,"Eminems tweet does contain offensive terms and language. However, even though the language is offensive, there is nothing in it that is harmful or violates any laws. It is just a discussion of the current state of affairs regarding gun laws in America. 
Similarly, Machine Guns Kellys tweet contains offensive content, but it also does nothing illegal. Machine guns are a highly regulated and restricted item, so it would be hard to acquire one without a license. Kelly is merely expressing his opinion that the law should be more strict on gun owners, which is an opinion shared by many Americans.

"
2109,2109,@USER Yup total gun control works just fine. Well not in Mexico.,"In this tweet the author is expressing their disagreement with a statement made by the Twitter user. In this case the statement was that gun controls don't work in certain places. 
This is an example of a non offensive tweet because the person expressing disagreement is asking for facts and not making personal comments or attacking the individual expressing the opinion being disagreed with.

While the phrase is commonly spoken, it does contain a negative tone towards those who do not share food or do so in an unappetizing manner. 
  This is why the Twitter community has classified it as offensive.

2111,2111,@USER @USER @USER Now u r making political issue. She died this is it. Many peoples r dying daily because of them. Why She is So Special ? Encashing her death for sympathy of Corrupt what r u doing Waseem Bhai ?,"This tweet contains profane language, however it is not directed at any specific group. Instead, it expresses an emotional reaction to the death of the journalist. 
  
  The language is coarse and does contain some curse words, and it may be offensive to some people. However, this does depend on individual preferences. 
Although the language may seem offensive, there is nothing in this tweet that directly attacks or insults any group of people based their gender or race. Therefore, we classify this as a non offensive tweet

A:
According to this article, Twitter has a ""hateful conduct"" policy.  It's not clear to me if that applies to profanities, though.

"
2112,2112,Are all the republiKlan maga wearing traitors going to dig through their childhood toy chest just to post videos of burning Ernie &amp; Bert dolls? ernieandbert SesameStreet Toad MarioKart TraitorTrump traitortoad,"While the text of this tweet contains some offensive terms, they are used in an offensive way to target specific individuals. Specifically, ""traitor"" is used to refer to a person who supports the president, and ""MarioKarten"" refers to the game ""Super Mario Kart."" The use of these terms in this way is considered offensive and could be considered harassment.

"
2113,2113,@USER @USER He is what he is by now.,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
Although the author of this tweet disagres with ESPN's decision to remove the Tweet, he does so in an open and nonoffensice manner, expressing his opinion and asking for facts to back up his claim. 
  

A:
According to this article, ""Turd"", as a slang word, is offensive: https://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamend/this-is-how-tweets-are-classified-on-twitter#.yqZVZQZyfM.  However, BuzzFeed's classification is based on a dictionary definition of ""turd"" as ""excrement"".  I don't know if that's the case for ""@user"", but it seems like a reasonable assumption.

"
2114,2114,@USER He is gay. He’s a sick pervert he gets on my nerves,"Offensive language: ""He is"" is an offensive statement to make about someone's sexual orientation. 
  
Negative sentiment: the tone of this tweet indicates that it is a negative comment about the other person.  The use ""he"" to refer to someone of another gender is also a sign of negative attitude.

"
2115,2115,@USER @USER Espn is a joke. She is an entitled bully who can't handle losing.,"Offensive language is used in the Tweet. 
  The language used is strong and negative. It is directed at the person who replied to the original Tweeter and contains a tone of negativity. 
In addition, this TWEET was sent in response to another TWTweet that was asking about causes of death related a natural disaster. In this case, it was a Hurricane.  In the response Tweed addressed the user who asked the question, but the language was also directed to Espns network of employees who were retweeting the message. As a result, Espnn was the target of the negative language.

"
2116,2116,@USER @USER Liberals are sick people!,"Liberally is a derisive term used by conservatives to describe liberals. 
  The term is deriding and offensive, as it implies that liberals are uninformed, unenlightened, gullible, stupid, hypocritical, etc. 
Antifas is another derision term that is used to refer to antifascists, which are anti-fascist activists. Antifascism is an approach to combating racism and fascism. This term implies antifas are violent and do not have good intentions.

"

The author of the Tweet is clearly a fan of micropoor, and the use and creativity of words is not derisive or negative. 
  
Bald is also not a derision word. While it may be considered negative in some contexts, it is generally not considered derrogatory.

"
2118,2118,WalkAway liberals......Your party is POISON. URL,"This tweet does contain a URL, but it's not offensive. In fact, many people find it amusing. Additionally, this tweet was sent in response to a tweet that contained offensive words and language towards conservatives. Therefore, URL is the best choice for the label.

"
2119,2119,"""@USER Feel free to use it. Because unlike your ilk, we do not scream literalviolence or use dramatic phrases like you are denying my right to exist wahh"""". Women like us can take your silliness without crying. Knock yourself out :)""""""","This tweet contains a parody of a popular rap song, ""Tik Tok"". The song's lyrics include lines such as ""I'mma let you use my phone, 'cause you don't know how to operate it"", ""You can't stop the violence in my city"", and ""We don’t need no gun controls, they don‘t work"". 
  
Although the parodied lyrics are offensive, this tweet's author has clearly used a satirical approach to paraphrase the song and make a point about the political climate surrounding gun violence. 
   
Therefore, although the lyrics themselves are considered offensive by some, their use in this context is not considered to constitute offensive speech.

"
2120,2120,@USER Except she didn’t resist and it got her where she is today :face_with_rolling_eyes: ,"This tweet contains a derisive term for a person, which is offensive. 
In addition, this tweet implies that the person who was arrested was not resisting arrest, when in fact she was. 
  This implies the author does NOT believe the arrested person was guilty of the crime for which she has allegedly been arrested.

"
2121,2121,@USER Eirc Holder: a friken idiot,"Offensive language is used in Tweet 1. 
In Tweets 2 and 3, there is mention of individuals by name, which is considered offensive in certain cultures. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, offensive terms should be flagged as such.  The guidelines also state that ""offensiveness depends on context"".  In this case, I believe the context is clear.

"
2122,2122,@USER @USER He is desperately trying to deflect. This is what Jordan &amp; Nunes have been wanting. Trump doesn’t care who he endangers. Fck tRump,"In the above tweet the user is criticizing a person for their political views. In the United States, free speech is protected and the person in question has the right to express their views without fear of repercussions. 
  
  The use and language used in this tweet could be considered offensive. However, it can also be viewed as humerous or sarcasm.

"
2123,2123,@USER Chicago has record number of homicides! Their gun control laws are not working!,"Offensive language includes explicit slurs, insults or other derisive terms. 
  Offensiveness can also be inferred from the context of use. For example, a slur used to describe a racial or ethnic group is likely to be offensive, whereas the same slang term used in a non offensive context may not be. Offensive content includes threats of violence, explicit references to sexual assault, and other explicit or graphic content that is considered offensive by a significant portion of society.

"

It is not focused solely on one person or a group. 
 It is a factual statement about the current political climate.

"
2125,2125,@USER The reason I give Aguearo a slight edge above Kane is because he is more creative. They're both clinical finishers don't het me wrong.,"Agueero is not a slur, and Kane does have a Hispanic surname. 
  The word ""slight"" is being used in the context of the comparison between Agueraro and Kanes clinical finishing style. This is an acceptable use of that word. 
While Kane has a more clinical style, Aguero's creative finishing techniques are more innovative. He has used a variety of techniques, such as the ""double leg sweep"" and ""spinning backfist"" to finish fights. These techniques have not been employed by Kane. Therefore, Kane's finishing skills are not considered ""clinical.""

"
2126,2126,@USER @USER “Blame your opponent of the things you are guilty of” - this pope is a satanist,"While the Pope's quote is not derisive, it does imply that the person who said it was guilty. This is an implication of a slur, and is therefore offensive because it expresses negative sentiments about an entire group of people based on their membership in that group.

"
2127,2127,@USER @USER @USER He is embarrassing and just as low a human as possible to diminish the loss of life of the elderly.,"Offensive language: the word ""embarrassing"" is offensive because the author is expressing their opinion that John Kerry is less than human. 
Targeted harassment: there is explicit language targeting the users mentioned in the text, such as ""the elderly.""

A:
According to this article, Twitter's TOS, ""harassment"" includes ""directly or indirectly making a threat to harm another person, based on or in response to a person's actual or perceived race, color, religion, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, disability, medical condition, marital status, political affiliation, source of income, age, sex, type, manner, appearance, reputation, status (including celebrity status), source, content, conduct, email address, username, social media account, comments, postings, messages, opinions, estimates, predictions, forecasts, projections, expectations, plans, intentions, suggestions, reviews, critiques, advice, assistance, support, recommendations, endorsements, protests, other statements, images, sounds, data, material, information, documents, files, code, inventions, discoveries, results of testing, analyses, conclusions, evaluations, reports, testimony, representations, promises, threats, assertions, rumors, gossip, speculation, insinuations, innuendoes, allegations, denials, implications, deductions, pointers, hints, jests, witticisms, pranks, hoaxes, extortion, blackmail, attempts or threats of physical harm or economic harm, death or disability.""

"
2128,2128,@USER @USER Shit come on unc!,"@user is an individual Twitter user. 
Shit is slang for ""fuck"". 

 

A:

I believe the offensive part of the comment is: 

 
""Starvation"" is offensive slur. 
  ""What is cause deaths?"" is question that is likely to offend some people.

"
2129,2129,@USER ......Google needs to be broken up....they are a threat to the country,"Google is an American company, so the use of the word ""broken up"" to refer to its dissolution is considered to contain offensive words and phrases. 
  
""Lumpen proletariat"" is slang for ""proletarian"", a derisive term used by the working class to describe the lower classes. While the term is not considered offensive on its own, when used in the context of a political discussion, its use can be seen as offensive.

"
2130,2130,5 Things You Are NOT Doing But Should Be Doing For Your Blog To Succeed - Did You Think About 3? URL URL,"This tweet contains no offensive words or phrases. 
It is a general comment on a topic related to blogging. 
  It does  not contain personal insults or attacks against any individuals.

"
2131,2131,@USER @USER Target environment keeps getting richer.,"This tweet contains no explicit threats or insults. It is merely a statement of fact. 
It is possible that the author of this Tweet is a fan of John M. C. Eroe, who is known for his outspoken and controversial opinions. 
  However, this does  not change the fact that this is just a factual statement about the target environment.

"
2132,2132,@USER Love how fat they all are while chowing down on cake and cookies. That's the future liberals want.,"Offensive: the use or threat of use offensive words or phrases, slurring, explicit insults, etc. 
Non-Offense: any use, even implicit, of offensiveness.

2133,2133,@USER @USER @USER Think about - Trumper supporters have to hide their support for Trump and/or take the life into their own hands if they go out w/Trump MAGA hat on-it never was like this in the America I remember. We could have our own political beliefs but still be civil &amp; cordial! Upsetting,"While the mention ""Trumper"" supporters might seem humerous, this is actually a reference to the Trump campaign, which the Antifas member is affiliated with. This is an explicit reference targeting Trump supporters, and the use the term ""upsetting"" to describe the reaction of Trump voters is meant to incite violence. 
  
  The mention that ""we couldhave ourown politicalbeliefs butstill becivil & cordianto!"" is not meant as an encouragement to keep fighting, but rather as another example of how the members of Antiflu could behave in a civil manner. However, while the sentiment is true, there is no way for the member of Anti-Fascist to know this, as the original tweet was sent in jest.

"
2134,2134,LeviStrauss CEO takes a side on gun control: ‘It’s inevitable that we’re going to alienate some consumers’ URL URL,"Levis CEO took a political side in a debate about gun laws. This is considered political speech and not an attack on an individual. 
  
  The CEO's side of this debate is that gun ownership is an American right and that it will be difficult for Americans to buy Levis if they are worried about the safety of their communities.

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""harassment, bullying, online trolling, incitement to violence, etc."" are not allowed on their platform.  The guidelines also state that ""abusive behavior"" is not acceptable either. 
In this case, @user's tweet contains a link to an article about Melania Trump's plagiarism scandal. @User's response to this tweet contained the following:

Funny how their words and actions never match up to what they pretend to preach. Imposters of any human decency. Emotionally and politically bankrupt.,"This tweet contains derisive language and offensive terms to describe ""Liberals"".

Linguistically, derision and contempt are not positive words to use to refer to someone. The term ""emotionALLY and POLITICALLY bankrupt"" is derrogatory and implies that someone is mentally or financially unstable. 
  
Additionally, this tweet implies the user is an imposter of some kind, possibly because they are a human being with different beliefs and opinions.

URL's are used to shorten long URLs, so that the long URL can fit in less space. URL is not considered derisive or offensive.

2140,2140,@USER @USER @USER @USER That is to say I was aware it wasn’t written for me. That’s ok though. You can tell that she really loves the housewife culture she is writing about. Imagine Shirley Jackson without the misanthropy.,"This tweet does contain a derisive term for a group of people, but it is used in an offensive manner and is therefore offensive. Derogative terms should be avoided in all circumstances, as they can be deeply offensive and cause significant harm to the targeted group. 
  
  The term ""housewife"" is derrogatory and offensive towards women who are not in the domestic sphere. This term is also used to describe women in positions of power, such as a CEO of a company. By using this term to refer to a fictional character, @shirleyjackson was making a statement about how women are portrayed in media. She was not being critical of all housewives, only of those in power who do not devote their lives to their children.

There is nothing in this tweet that would suggest that it was sent by a bot. 
  The user mentions a brother who is also 30, which is an age at which many brothers and sisters no longer look similar.

"
2143,2143,@USER He is a knucklehead. He is not making good decisions.,"This tweet does contain derisive language towards an individual, Louis Farrakhan, and a group, whites. However, this language is used in a way that is meant to insult or make fun of Louis' beliefs and actions, rather than targeting any individual in particular. The language also does include slurring, however, in this case, of ""knuckleheads"". Additionally the context of the original tweet makes it clear that the author is making a joke about Louis and his followers, so the offensive nature is mitigated. 
  
Although the content of this tweet may be offensive, I believe that it is more likely to offend someone than to not. This is because it contains derision towards someone based solely on who they are, without any reference to their characteristics or actions that may make them deserving of derISION.

"
2144,2144,@USER Dominos is ass,"While the use the term ""Dominos"" might not be offensive by itself, in this context, when used in reference to Antifas, is a slur that is commonly used by the far-right to refer to members of Antiracist groups. 
  
  The use ""bum ass"" is an offensive slang term used to describe a person who is slow or has low self-esteem. While it is not used here to insult Antiraqsts, its use in combination with the phrase ""Antifa is"" makes it seem as if the author is making a derisive reference.

"
2145,2145,@USER what the fuck happened,"While the content of this Tweet is not offensive, its author is a known troll who has a history of targeting people based on their political beliefs. 
  
  The Tweeter in question has previously targeted users who are members of a religious minority, and used offensive and inflammatory language.

Jeff Flakem is an offensive derisive term for a person with an attitude.

people.

"
2147,2147,@USER He went broke and got propped up by white liberals in Hollywood. That’s white privilege all day long. Stop defending coke head Tom Arnold.,"This tweet does contain derisive language towards TomArnold, a well-known actor who has made controversial statements in the past. However, this language is not aimed at any one person or specific groups of people. Instead, it is an expression of Tom Arnold's past actions and opinions, as well as a general commentary on his career and the media's response to his actions. 
  
Additionally, although the language used in this tweet may be derrogatory, there is nothing in it that is directed at a particular group of individuals. Therefore, we classify this as not being offensive.

2149,2149,@USER @USER @USER You forgot ANTIFA,"AnTIFa is a slur used to refer to members of Antifa, a far-left group that has engaged in violence. Antifa has also been used as a pejorative to describe someone who is against Antiracist activism. 
  
  The use of this slang term in the context of a CNN Tweet is offensive.

"
2150,2150,@USER She's a Liberal professor dog. Always spewing her hatred against us Conservatives. You're going to HELL with the rest of the Sleaze BAGS.,"This tweet contains no explicit slur or derisive term. 
It does, however, express an unpopular opinion. 
  The author is criticizing a social movement, and the negative impact that it has had on society. This is a valid topic of discussion, but the author does so in a way that does NOT insult or target any particular group or individual.

"
2151,2151,@USER Gutierrez you’re such a liar that’s all you guys are good for,"GutierreZ is an offensive term used to refer to someone who lies. 
  The term is derisive and is used as a slur against someone with a low opinion of their truthfulness.

"
2152,2152,@USER @USER @USER 2bn is notong term that shud b annually.,"This tweet contains a number, not a term. This is a common reason that a tweet may be classified non offensive. 
  
  However, it could also be considered offensive if the number was a slur or a derisive term for a group of people.

"
2153,2153,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER No it's not. Too many people in and around government want to asset strip the NHS and sell it off to profiteers on an ideological whim. That they're doing this against the will of the British people smacks of arrogance and greed.,"This tweet contains a derisive term for people who support the government's position on Brexit, and does so in a way that is not derrogatory. 
  
  The term is used in the context of a debate about the merits of leaving the EU, so it is a fair derision to apply to those who hold a particular position. However, in this context, @user uses the term in an affectionate way, to describe his personal preference for a different approach to Brexit. This is an example of how deriding someone for their beliefs can be derided in ways that are not offensive.


However, this tweet also contains derailing terms, such as 'asset strip', 'ideological whim', and 'profiteer'. These derailers are deranged, not just derrière, derangement. They are used to attack the person who expressed a view that differs from @User's, rather that the view itself. In this case, they are being used against those concerned about NHS privatisation. @USER is deranging the debate by using derailed terms to deride those with a contrary view. He is using the derails to distract from the substance of his argument, by attacking those he disagrees with. 
In this instance, I believe the use of deragatory and derriere terms is the more offensive part of this message. I would not consider it derisorory to call someone a 'joke' or a ""liar"". However the 'liars' and ""jokes"" used here are the ones made by @userto @users opponents, who are then attacked for being derange.  This is offensive behaviour. 


I believe that @Users deridering of opponents is more derrierre than derringer, as it implies that they have deranger mental health issues. While I do not believe this to be the case for @usr, his derackerising of those opposed to his position is indeed derirrier than just derrisorer. As such, he should be advised that his behaviour is in violation of our terms of service, for which we will be taking action. Please note that we have already taken action against this user for other violations of these terms (including the abusive use and spread of memes that contain derailler terms).

"
2154,2154,@USER She is the size of a stadium,"While the use of the word ""stadium"" in the context of this tweet could potentially be considered offensive, in this context it is not. In the original tweet the author was comparing the physical size and stature of two different people. 
  
  The word is used in a positive context in other parts of that same tweet. For example, ""She is a beautiful woman."" 
   
In addition, although the term ""size"" is commonly used as a slur, this is only one factor in determining whether a word or phrase is offensive. Other factors include the frequency of use, context, and intended audience.

"
2155,2155,@USER straightfire needs to win tonight. She is the rightful women’s champion. hiac,"There is not enough context to determine the intent of this tweet; it is possible that the author is simply congratulated for a job well done. 
  
However, given the context of a recent article about the Australian e-cigarette controversy, we believe the tweeter is criticizing the use and implications of e cigarette advertising in Australia. This is an ad-hominem attack on an individual based on their position in an e cig industry controversy.

"
2156,2156,@USER @USER I hear he is having an MEI on his knee due to the pressure exerted. Lol,"This tweet contains a reference to a medical condition, ME, and a possible treatment. While the reference is likely meant to poke fun at someone, it is unlikely to cause offense.

"
2157,2157,@USER she is free as a bird to return to her Muslim homeland,"This tweet contains no explicit offensive terms or images. 
It does express a critical opinion of the character, however, it is not a personal attack. 
  The opinion is based on facts and is therefore not offensive.

"
2158,2158,@USER LMAO man people were talking so much shit yesterday. Any comment Marvel stan twitter? Moe overused Thanos jokes or... URL,"Thanos is a character in the Marvel Comics universe. Thousands of people follow the character on Twitter. Marvel fans often use Thanoes jokes in their tweets. 
  
  The use in context of Mores over-used jokes about rape is meant to degrade and insult the victim of the joke. This is an offensive slur used to target and degrade a group of individuals.

"
2159,2159,followed all not previously followed. maga kag walkaway trumptrain nodaca iwantthewall URL,"@USER is a Twitter handle of a user who has not followed the account. 
MAGA is an acronym for ""Make America Great Again"" and a political slogan used by President Donald Trump. 
  NODACA is slang for the ""no doubt about it"" phrase. This phrase is commonly used in hip hop music. The phrase can also be used as an interjection to express surprise or doubt.

"
2160,2160,@USER @USER I suggest using handcuffs to remove you!,"Although the use of handcuff in the above tweet may be considered offensive, this is an extreme example and is unlikely to occur in normal public conversation. 
  
  The use and context of the word ""suck"" in relation to the gun debate is also considered derisive and offensive by many. However, its use in context with other words and phrases such as ""open your eye"" and ""your hero"" may not be derisor.

"
2161,2161,@USER Gun control...breathe...sight picture....squeeze. This professor needs further instruction. :),"This tweet is not offensive. While it contains an explicit term that is considered derisive, there is no indication that the term is intended to target a specific group of people. Furthermore, while the message is directed at a professor, and the professor is a person, this does little to indicate that this term was intended as an insult. 
  
However, even if this tweet were offensive, that would not necessarily mean that it was directed specifically at the target user. In fact, based on context, we believe that most of this user’s followers would find this offensive as well. Therefore, in this case, a targeted response would be inappropriate.

"
2162,2162,@USER Element of surprise has gone then Somehow i think this is more,"This tweet contains no explicit or implicit offensive terms or phrases. 
It does mention a person or group by name, however, it does so in the context of criticizing a policy or action, and not targeting an individual or a group in an offensive way (e.g., it is not a direct attack on an ethnic group, religion, gender, etc.).

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offense"" is defined as: ""verbal, physical, emotional, economic or any other form of insult or injury that causes serious or substantial harm"".
In this case, there is no physical or emotional insult, so the offense label cannot be applied.

"
2163,2163,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER The world knows that Right wing extremists are responsible for more terror attacks that leave people actually dead in the US than all other groups combined.... statistical fact. Will remind not 1 case of anyone dying because of antifa... your not on solid ground here..,"While the use ""statistical fact"" may be considered offensive, there is no evidence to support the claim that right-wing extremism is responsible more attacks than any other group. In fact, a report by the Anti-Defamation League found that the number of right wing-related attacks was ""negligible"" compared to left-leaning groups. 
  
Additionally, while the prediction is based off of a single tweet that does contain derisive terms, such as ""tower of babel,"" the term ""antifa"" is not used in a derrogatory manner. Rather, ""Antifa"" refers to an activist group against "" antifascism,"" a term used to describe those who oppose racism and fascism.

"
2164,2164,@USER It is a suicide mission if they don't put him on the bench! Standup for justice and I don't mean the warped sense of justice preached by the liberals. Get 'er done! URL,"While the first tweet contains offensive terms, ""suicide mission"" and ""preached"", the second tweet does contain offensive words, but in a positive way. ""Standup"" for just ""get 'em done"" is an example of a supportive and positive word. In addition, while the third tweet may contain derrogatory language, there is no explicit derisive term or offensive word in it.

"
2165,2165,@USER It's great to see you posting this. It shows everyone the disrespect you have for teachers and their role. And it proves that you are wholly unsuitable for any position in parliament.,"While the use and tone of the words ""lying face"" might be considered offensive, they are not used in the context of attacking any specific individual. In addition, although the word ""pleaz"" is considered slang, its use in this context is not derogatory. Finally, while the term ""sucking around"" can be offensive in some contexts, in context it is used to describe the behavior of politicians who are seeking votes.

"
2166,2166,@USER please don’t tell me your going left? Use to be unbiased on most part but the hate one definitely is coming from a side that denounced the alt right as should be but says nothing about antifa and their hatred. It demonizes Trump which again is not unbiased reporting,"While the user may have expressed some negative feelings about CNN in the past, this does little to explain the offensive nature of their statement about the network's ""true enemy"" status. While the statement may not be entirely negative or negative-sounding, there is still an element of hate in it. Hate speech is considered offensive, and the use of derisive language to describe a group of people is hateful. 
  
  The statement also contains a clear reference to the ""alt right"" and antifascist groups, both of which are considered hate groups. Antifa and its members have been accused of committing a number of violent acts, including the murder of a police officer. This is a reference that is clearly meant to incite violence against antifas.

"
2167,2167,"""@USER @USER I would temporarily change parties if the Republican party would Primary agent orange"""" with a REAL, Republican, Conservative. That would MAGA!!! At least a great start.""""""","This tweet contains a derisive term for a political party, agent or orange. 
  This is derision, and deriding people or groups is offensive. 
However, this is not the case with agent red. Agent red is an acronym for Agent Orange, a toxic defoliant used during the Vietnam War. This is neither derided nor offensive, so this tweet is classified non offensive

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""derisiveness, satire, parody, irony, humor, etc. are all forms of protected speech on Twitter.""
So, I don't think this particular tweet should be considered offensive by the company.

"
2168,2168,@USER He is making faces like Peter strokz...,"This tweet does contain offensive slur and derrogatory term. 
  ""Peter Strok"" is an antisemitic slang term used by the Nazi party to refer to people with ""seemingly unlimited wealth"". 
   The term is also used in modern times by far-right groups. 
Additionally, ""faces with Monocles"" are not an expression of interest or surprise. They are a stereotype of an ""evil"" person.

"
2169,2169,@USER Let me guess they are a victim of circumstances. But heaven forbid if they got shot for robbing the place all you moron liberals would be screaming gun control. How about kid control or upbringing control of self control.,"Offensive language includes strong words like ""cunt"", ""moron"", and ""fucking"".
Negative terms include ""victim"", which is used to describe someone who has suffered a loss, ""self control"", a term used for controlling one's emotions, thoughts, actions, etc., and even ""upbringing"", used as a derisive term to refer to someone's childhood. 
  

While the language used in the Tweet is strong, it is not directed at any individual in particular. The Tweeter is simply expressing their opinion on a topic. While the opinion may be offensive to some, that does NOT make it offensive towards any particular individual.

"
2170,2170,@USER @USER She is lying to you... She is outright lying...,"This tweet contains no explicit language that would be deemed offensive. The language used is generally positive and encouraging, and does include some terms that may be controversial or potentially offensive to some readers. 
  
However, there is also no evidence to suggest that this is an attempt to mislead the user. In fact, this seems like a fairly straightforward statement of fact.

"
2171,2171,ASMR EEL SUSHI SALMON SUSHI (EATING SOUNDS) *BIG BITES No Talking | YAYA ASMR URL,"This tweet contains no explicit hateful language. 
It is an example of AS MRR, a style of content that is generally considered to have a positive tone. 
  

A:
According to this article, ASMSMR is one of several categories of ""subtle racism"" that can be identified by the NLP model.  The article also mentions that ASMsMR content is often used by white supremacists to promote their ideology.

"
2172,2172,@USER Combined IQ= -6,"This tweet contains only nonoffensiveness, as it is a simple arithmetic calculation. 
  The ""+6"" is not derisive or offensive, but rather a way to explain the result of an arithmetic operation.

"
2173,2173,@USER @USER @USER John careful... liberals will attack you for thinking critically because the facts aren't on their side,"This tweet contains no explicit slur or offensive term. 
It expresses an opinion about political issues in an open and respectful way. 
"
2174,2174,@USER @USER Agreed. Iowa State was able to get to him a few times just after he released it. I tend to think he is more durable than most though.,"Although the word ""durable"" might sound like a negative trait, in this context it is used in a positive sense. The user is referring to Iowa's quarterback as ""more durable"" than other players, but does so in an affectionate way. 
  

@USER Iowa was also able get the ball into the endzone a couple of times after that.  I tend think that he's more resilient than some though.

"
2175,2175,"""@USER Republicans love to say it's too early to talk"""" about common sense gun control after these events - what they really want is people to forget and amnesia to kick in so they can ignore doing their jobs which is to protect the public Gun control works and R's just procrastinate""""""","While the use the word ""Republicans"" in this context is offensive, it is not the only offensive word in that tweet; the rest of it also contains derisive terms and offensive emoticons. 
  
  The ""cries face emote"" is a derrogatory term for people who are not emotionally expressive. While it may be used in an affectionate manner, its use in such a context implies that the user does in fact do not care about the topic at hand. This is an offensive slur.

"
2176,2176,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER He'd laugh at the modern Antifa,"There is nothing offensive in this tweet. Eliminating all offensive words from a tweet would be impossible, as Twitter provides a limited character count for each tweet and the offensive terms would have to fit within that limit. 
This tweet expresses a speculative opinion, based on a recent news story. In the context of the conversation, it was not clear whether the user was expressing their own opinion or responding to another user's. 
  The user used derrogatory language to express their opinion that the Antifas would not be able to handle the current political climate. This derogy was based off of a news article about Antiochian Orthodox Christian Church leader Bishop Tito Moniz, who was arrested by the FBI for allegedly conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.

"
2177,2177,@USER :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: exaggerating so much! You are appreciated.,"Eminems tweet does contain offensive words such as ""rape"", ""hypocrite"", and ""con"" but the context of the entire tweet makes it clear that the word ""rapist"" is being used in a derisive manner. 
  
  The word is used as a slur to describe a conservative. This is clearly deriding the group the slurs are being applied to.

"
2178,2178,@USER @USER is trying too hard to create a racist agenda.,"@USER appears in the Tweet as a username. 
In the Twitter profile bio, @USREdWright, he describes himself as an African-American man. 
  Based off of this description, it is likely that @User is an individual who is of African American descent. This is because African Americans are disproportionately impacted by police violence, discrimination, poverty, incarceration, etc. and therefore have been historically targeted by the Democratic Party for political gain. Therefore, when @user Tweets about the Democrats targeting conservatives for racial reasons, they likely are expressing their personal opinion, based on their own experiences as African America.

"
2179,2179,@USER As we should declare ANTIFA a terrorists group and investigate all of it's members.,"This tweet contains a derisive term for a political group, which is not acceptable. 
Although the term is derrogatory, there is no explicit reference to any person or organization by name, so it could still be considered acceptable if the context of use was clear. 
  
  The term ""ANTifa"" is a reference in the future tense to a group that the author supports. This is an acceptable use of ""anticipate"" in this context.

"
2180,2180,@USER many thanks to Karel in banquet services - he is treating our ONA student newsroom team sooooo well. We really appreciate the whole team!,"Karel is a colleague who works in Banquet Services. He is thanked for treating the news room team well in a tweet. 
  
Many thanks, Karels, for the great work you are doing!

"
2181,2181,@USER @USER @USER Like London with land banked luxury apartments but little or no social housing built.,"In the context of this tweet the phrase ""Like London"" is used to describe a positive experience. It is not used as an insult or to express a negative opinion towards a particular group.

"
2182,2182,@USER I thought it would be worse. I thought they would be shooting liberals in the streets by now.,"This tweet contains a reference to the 2016 US presidential election, in which then-candidate Donald Trump made derisive comments about Hillary Clinton and her supporters. Although the comment was offensive, there is nothing derrogatory or aggressive in this tweet. 
  
Although the context of this message may be political, this is not the primary reason for the classification.

"
2183,2183,@USER @USER Good shit my bad though,"This tweet contains derisive language targeting a specific person, group of people, or their beliefs. 
It is also possible that the Twitter API is not able to detect offensive content in this tweet. Please check with your company to confirm.

"
2184,2184,@USER Me and bronbron are cool now. It's ok if he eat ass lakergang,"Offensive language: ""lakengang"" is slang for ""ass licking"" and is generally considered offensive
Slurs: the use of ""faggot"" or ""retard"" in a non derisive way is also considered highly offensive, as is the word ""nigger""

2185,2185,@USER @USER @USER You mean cheating allegations. Not sexual harassment or assault it was about CHEATING. BIG difference. We all know facts scare liberals. If you are so concerned about sexual assaults you need to shout for the names on the slush funds to be revealed. Until than have a seat,"In the first tweet the user mentions only one dollar bill and makes a statement about it. This is not an offensive statement. 
However, in the second tweet Antifas is mentioned, which is a group that is considered offensive by some people. The mention of this group is likely what caused the model to predict the label as non offensive in this case. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter API, Louis Farrakhan is an account that has 0 followers.  The account @user is the account of the following user. @username is their handle.   
So, @USER is Louis farrackhan.

"
2186,2186,@USER Ugh put your antifa mask back on before you scare the children,"It is a humerous remark that is not meant to be taken seriously. 
While the comment is related to the topic of masks, it does  not contain offensive terms or slur. 
  It does contain a suggestion to put the mask on again, but it can also be understood as an innocent suggestion.

"

"
2189,2189,@USER He needs a long look in the mirror,"A:

I think the reason is that the opinion expressed in this tweet isn't targeted at any particular group.  It's just an expression of the author's personal opinion.

"
2190,2190,@USER If we lose tomorrow we r fucked. Tomorrow is our season lol. Too tough a schedule to drop one like this,"Offensive: ""If we lost tomorrow, we're fucked.""
Non-Offensice: ""...too tough of schedule for one to lose like that""

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as ""the use of words, phrases, tone, volume, pace, color, style, subject matter and other factors that are perceived by some people, especially those with a sensitive sense of taste, as being offensive or distasteful"".
In this case, I think the word ""fuck"" falls into the offensive category.

"
2191,2191,@USER @USER was spreading FakeNews about @USER FYI. MAGA,"This tweet does contain strong words, but they are used in a derisive way to describe the individual. This is an offensive way of describing someone. 
  
  The use of derision is not considered offensive in and of itself. Derision can be used to point out the absurdity of something, as in ""that's deranged"". Derisively using strong terms to criticize someone is also not necessarily offensive. For example, ""he's a scumbag"" is deriding but not offensive, because scum is used as a slur to refer to low-value people. In this case, scUMBA is using the word in the derisorical sense. 
However, in this particular case the use is offensive because the term is being used deride someone as an individual, rather than as part of a group.

"
2192,2192,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Super President like Multiversity? Good ideia,"Although the word ""multiversity"" is used in a positive manner, it does contain offensive terms such as ""monopoly"" and ""duopoly.""

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" can be determined by looking at the context of the Tweet. In this case, there is none. 
""Offensiveness"" could be decided by the number of emoticons used, but in this particular case there are none that could reasonably be considered offensive.

"
2193,2193,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER H1v3 does good videos &amp; u do good work occasionally why focus on other activists rather than be productive? You might not support Antifa that's fine. Yes it has some funding from Soros undeniably doesn't mean everyone is paid by Soros.,"In the first part of this tweet the author expresses their opinion that H3v1 does ""good videos"" and that the ""author"" sometimes ""do[es] good works."" The author does mention that ""sometimes"" the work is done by ""H3 v1,"" which is a reference to Hector Rincon, a YouTuber who has collaborated with Hateful 3. However, this does little to support the opinion expressed in the second part, which states that other ""activists"" should be ""productive"" instead of focusing on ""be[ing] productive."" This part is the most offensive, as it implies that Rinscon and other Youtubers who criticize the far-right are not ""active"" or ""engaged"" in their work, when in fact they are.

"
2194,2194,@USER @USER We’ll we’ve been fucked by bama twice since we got here so we’re almost tru fans,"@USER is a username that was not provided in the original tweet. 
We’VE been FUCKED by BAMA twice? That’s a new one. We've been here since early 2010. 
  We've had 3 presidents, 3 Bushes, 2 Clintons, a Carter, 4 Gores, 1 Obama, & we're still here.  

It’d be nice to think that we could be considered “almost truer fans” of a president than we were of the last one, even if we haven’t been able to name a single song by a particular president.

"
2195,2195,@USER @USER This is absolutely hilarious. Liberals are so predictable.,"This tweet does contain derrogatory or threatening language (slur), and it does address a relevant topic (racism). However, it also does express an honest opinion, which is why it was classified this way.

"
2196,2196,@USER @USER Looks Like The Jokes On Liberals Again. FortTrump Poland BoomingEconomy URL,"While the text of the Tweet is critical of various individuals, including Antifas, Farhakhan, BLMs, BlackPanthers, and the like, there is no direct targeting of any individuals or explicit use of slurring terms or offensive words. 
  The text is simply expressing opinions about groups of people, with no explicit targeting or slashing.

"
2197,2197,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Let’s keep the same energy when talking about gun control after a mass shooting,"In the original tweet the user was discussing gun laws and the need for stricTER regulations. In response to the mass shootings in Florida and Texas the author of this answer wanted to keep their energy and focus on supporting the victims and their families.

"
2198,2198,@USER Goodell is one of the worst things that has ever been unleashed on Pro Sports. Useless!!!,"While the use and tone of emojis may be questioned, they are not considered offensive in and of themselves. 
  The use in the quoted tweet of slur words like ""pro sports"" and ""useless"" is considered derisive and offensive.

"
2199,2199,@USER @USER @USER No liberals just state they believe her because she is a woman and democrat. They state they do not believe Kavanaugh because he is a man and should “shut up”. They probably believe OJ.,"Although the comment is critical of several individuals mentioned in the Tweet, there is no explicit or implicit offensive content in it. 
It is not a personal attack on any individual. 
 It is just a humerous remark about the political climate at the time.

"
2200,2200,@USER BURN your Nike gear. Everyone I know is done buying Nike. Oops. Conservatives are the ones buying from Nike. After all we r the ones making the money There’s way way more of us :middle_finger: Nike,"While the comment is clearly derisive, it does contain some offensive terms and language, specifically the use of the term ""Nike"" to refer to conservatives. 
  
  The derision in this comment stems from the fact that the person making this statement is unable to distinguish between Nike and conservatives, which is an example of a lack of self-awareness.

"
2201,2201,@USER @USER You people calling everyone Nazis under the sun becomes tiring and stupid frankly. You people called Zena Bash a Nazi and it turns out she is half Mexican and Polish descent and her family barely escaped death from the Nazis. So keep it up desensitize that word.,"In the first tweet the author makes negative implications and assumptions about a person based on their political affiliation. This is considered tobe offensive because it is based off of assumptions rather than facts. 
Secondly, in the second tweet a user called a woman a ""Nazi"" and the user felt that the use of the word was ""tired"" because other users were doing the same thing. In this case the offensive word is ""nazi"", which can be offensive to people of Jewish descent.

"
2202,2202,@USER CONSERVATIVES ARE CREEPY COWARDS URL,"Conservatives are a political party in America. They are considered to have a generally negative view on LGBTQ+ rights, women's rights and racial equality. Therefore, it can be inferred that the author of the above tweet may have had a personal bias against conservatives. 
  
However, this tweet does contain strong language that is offensive towards women and LGBT people. Additionally, there is no indication that this person is personally biased against conservative views. As a result, we classify this as offensive.

"
2203,2203,@USER And Obama didn’t.... not to you because you agreed with him.....,"While the word ""sucking"" is offensive, there is no explicit hateful language in the rest of the message. It is merely expressing disagreement with someone. 
  
  The user is not expressing personal insults or attacks on any of these individuals. They are merely disagreeing with their political stance. While this is an opinion, expressing it on Twitter is still considered a form a discourse.

It was unclear whether the term was derision of a specific group or a generalisation. 
  
  The term is derrogatory, so it may be offensive to some groups. However, it does contain no offensive words, is not clearly intended to offend, does little to identify the group being derided,  and is a statement of opinion. Therefore, this is classified in the non offensive category.

"
2205,2205,@USER Hatred of the man makes people like this fool say things like this. Not reality.,"Offensive language includes words like ""f*ck"", ""c*nt"", and ""b*tch"".
Slurs include words that are used to describe a group of people, such as ""n*gga"" and other derisive terms used for people of color. 
  
Negative sentiment includes statements that express negativity, including the use ""cry face"". 
   
Controversial statements include statements with factual inaccuracies, like the statement that John ""Podesta"" is ""a spiritcooking pedophile"". This statement is not only false, as Podestas are not spirit-cooks, and Podeste is an adult male, however, there is also the implication that Podesto is sexually abusing children. This is defamation, even if the factual accuracy is ignored.

2207,2207,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Please get out to vote Republican right down the ticket or Pelosi gets back into control,"While the use and tone of the words used in the original tweet are strong, they do not explicitly target anyone or contain slurring language.  The sentiment expressed is positive, and the request for the individual to do something is for their own good.

"
2209,2209,@USER These things happen from time time. Likely to be antifa or a group like that causing trouble as they have nothing better to do,"While the language in the first tweet could be considered offensive, there is nothing derrogatory or harmful in it, so it is classified here. 
In the second tweet the word ""likely"" is used to describe a situation that may or may not have occurred. This is a neutral term that does describe the situation, but does so without using offensive terms. Therefore, this tweet also has a non offensive predicted classification.

"
2210,2210,@USER This asshole( @USER ) Lies about Republicans,"@USER is an offensive username.

2211,2211,New emergency hotline?What's down the road? 2 days ago POTUS signs second State of Emergency executive order? Social media censorship down the road? MAGA Emergency QAnon MondayMotivation ConstitutionDay URL,"This tweet does include derisive language towards President Trump, but it is not targeted at any particular person or groups. Furthermore, it does express an unpopular opinion, however, this is an expression of personal opinion and not a statement of fact. 
  
Social media platform censorship is also a topic that is commonly discussed on Twitter. However, there are no derogaatory slur or hateful language in the Tweet.

"
2212,2212,@USER I call her the Negative Nellie who lives in my brain. I constantly battle with her. She is a creep.,"Offensive language and slang may include words like ""creeper,"" ""slut,"" or ""hoe.""

While the use of slangs or derisive language is not condoned, offensive slurring should be considered against the background of a sustained pattern of use. 
  
Hate speech includes words or phrases like the N-word, terms associated with white supremacy, etc. that are intended to denigrate and insult a group of people.

"
2213,2213,A country in which we are happy to hunt constitutional presidents in the desert because the Chancellor is referring to her truth about Antifa videos. Merkelkratie Maassen Merkel Seehofer URL,"This tweet contains a URL, a form of hyperlink that can take the reader to a website or webpage. URLs are generally considered to not be harmful, but they can be used to distribute harmful content. In this case, it's not clear what website the URL is pointing to, so it would be difficult to determine whether the content hosted on that website is harmful or not. 
  
In addition, this tweet includes a derisive term for a group of people, Merkelkrater Maassenhofer, who are known for their role in starting the German Revolution of 1918-19. This term is considered derrogatory and offensive, even if it isn't slurring or using offensive words.

"
2214,2214,Ms Fords has made a MAGA mistake! How will she escape the truth which is going to be that her useless lie will not stop US from ConfirmJudgeKavanaugh MondayMotivaton MAGA WWG1WGA WalkAway WalkAwayFromDemocrats2018 URL,"While the language in the Tweet is profane, there is no explicit hateful language, and the target of the profanities is not identified. 
  
  The TWEET is primarily focused around a pattern that Ms Ford has exhibited in previous testimony, namely that she has attempted to minimize the significance of her testimony. While the use of profanes may offend some, they do not explicitly attack any group of people based upon their protected characteristic, nor do they use any hate-speech.

"
2215,2215,@USER Apparently she was a diva when she was with heathers and I think she might’ve gotten fired for it? And she said something like 2 years ago that people took as being trans or homophobic I don’t remember,"This tweet contains a slur against the name ""HeatherS.""

While slurred names are not considered offensive in and of themselves, they can be offensive when used to insult or demean a person based on their membership in that group (e.g., ""heatherslut,"" ""hottie,"" or ""ditz"").
In this case, ""diva"" is a derisive term for a woman who is overly concerned with her appearance or image. This term is considered derrogatory and offensive against women. Additionally, this term was used against Heathers in reference to a time when the character was considered to have been ""too divA,"" which could be considered homophobia. 
  
  The Twitter user's mention of ""2 years a go"" could also be interpreted as transphobic. Transgender people are often denied employment or fired from their jobs due, in part, to discrimination based upon their gender identity. In this context, if the user was fired 2 or more years prior, that could constitute a hate crime.

2218,2218,@USER Antifa thugs remind me of orcs if they are stupid enough to try and take someones firearm i wouldn't be surprised if its an orc who is thrown in a dumpster,"Antifa is an anti-fascist organization that stands in opposition to far-right groups. Antifas are often associated with white supremacy and neo-Nazism. 
  
Orcs are a fictional race of creatures in J.R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. They are generally portrayed as brutish and short-lived.

2219,2219,@USER Congrats Naomi! U deserved to win. U showed true sportsmanship during Serena’s meltdown. I would like to apologize for her behavior. What an embarrassment for the US. She should have been ejected for arguing with the side chair. She thinks she is superior but she’s not.,"This tweet contains a personal apology to Naomí for Serenas behavior during the match. The apology is not directed to anyone in particular, so it does contain offensive terms and content, however, without context it can be considered acceptable. 
  
Serena Williams was the subject of a lot of discussion during this match, as she was playing her way through the rounds of her first-round match against Naomin. Serene was in an aggressive mood, arguing and shoving her chair in frustration. Naoming was not happy with Sereena's behavior, calling a timeout and eventually ejecting her from the court. In the post-match interview, Seenina apologized to the chair and to everyone watching for letting her emotions get the better of herself. This apology was considered to contain a fair amount of offensive words and language. However, in context with other words, this tweet could also be seen as acceptable, containing a reasonable apology for a poor performance.

2220,2220,@USER @USER @USER (Basically PSA is spoonfeeding liberals exactly what they want to hear rather than confronting the structural inequities that they in part helped foster/implement),"@USER is an account that has not tweeted offensive messages. They are not directly insulting anyone or using inflammatory language. Their tweet was asking for clarification about a situation that is controversial and could be offensive to some. 
  
PSA is commonly used to refer to public service announcement, a message intended to inform or educate. In this case, it was used in a non offensive way to convey information to liberals about what is happening in the US.

"

  “Shit” is a derisive term for someone who is less than perfect. “Shit” can also be used as an expletive. This term is not used in a positive way. 
“i’M” refers to someone as if they were a child. While this is an informal way of addressing someone, it can come across as condescending.

2222,2222,@USER @USER @USER How many car windows did you smash today while wearing a pussy hat? You anti-American antifa fucktards are a pathetic waste of life.

URL,"While the first tweet does discuss the subject of guns in a nonoffending manner, its second tweet contains derisive terms and offensive slang, such as ""pussy hat"" and "" antifagot"". The derision and slurring are likely to offend a significant portion of users, who may find the language offensive or distasteful. 
"
2223,2223,@USER @USER He is on the practice squad and they did sign Soldier to play LT. Granted I would of preferred they did more on the OL but they made changes.,"While the comment may be critical of Jeff's football career, there is no explicit or implicit slur targeting any individual, group of people, race or gender. The comment is supportive and encouraging, but does express criticism of a decision made by Jeff. 
  
  The comment does contain strong words and phrases that may offend some people and is therefore offensive. Offensive language includes slang, acronyms, pejoratives, profanity, racial or ethnic slights, personal attacks, sexual innuendo, as well as any other words or phrases likely to evoke a negative emotional response.

  The slurred word is used in the context of food, so it may not apply to the person being discussed. Additionally, this word can have multiple negative connotations, depending on who is saying it and in what context. For example, in some circles, a ""tight chicken"" is a derisive term for a small, tight-fitting shirt. This slang term is offensive in many circles. In this case, while the slung is derrogatory, its use in this context is not. Therefore, we classify this as offensive.

"
2225,2225,WhatILearnedToday Liberals are the scum of the earth Absolute treason.,"This tweet contains offensive slur and derogsatory term ""Liberals""

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offense"" is defined as ""verbal, physical, sexual, emotional, economic, political or any other form of abuse"".
In this case, I think the offense is the use the term 'L Liberals' to refer to liberals in general.

"

However, ""good times"" was a popular TV series from the 1980s and 1990s, starring Jasmine Guy, Jason Priestley, Kenan Thompson, John Amos, Teri Hatcher, Marlo Thomas, Robby Benson, Eric Braeden, Andre Braugher, Lark Voorhies, Ossie Davis, Jr., and Robbie Williams.

2232,2232,@USER where did you dig this one from? She is dope sha,"Offensive content is content that promotes, encourages, incites, and/or encourages the commission of illegal acts of violence against individuals, organizations, institutions, etc. 
In this case, ""dope"" is a slur that refers to a person who is ""stupid"" or ""ghetto."" The word is commonly used to describe a rapper or other popular figure. 
  
  The word ""sha"" refers specifically to ""shaking down"" a female. This is an expression of sexual desire that can be used in an offensive manner, especially if the speaker is making a sexual comment.

without any negative implications.

"
2234,2234,@USER she’s my bitch,"This tweet contains a derisive term for women, 'bitch'. This is an offensive term, as women are not 'bitches' and should not be addressed in this way.

"
2235,2235,@USER @USER @USER @USER Huh!

The context is also not positive, as it suggests that the funding will be used for gun controls. 
  
  The word ""$25 million"" also is generally considered not offensive in this context, but it's context (announced funding) is negative.

"
2236,2236,Calif buys more MAGA URL,"While the content of the Tweet is not offensive, there is a clear negative slant towards a certain political party. This is because the political affiliation of a person or group is typically the main topic of discussion in political discussions. 
  
  The Tweeter is clearly expressing their opinion in an attempt to get others to agree with them. However, this does contain offensive statements such as ""you would not guess"" and ""she plays covet on an iPad"". 
   
In addition, while the employee in question is described in positive terms, their political affiliations are clearly the focus of criticism. Therefore, they are not being targeted in this TWEET.

The Way Cool patch was the ! Love GUNS and TITTIES! WalkAway MAGA TRUMP,"This tweet contains a slur against African-Americans, who are often referred to as ""blacks."" The slurred term is ""titties."" Although this slang term might not be offensive to everyone, using slangs or offensive terms to make a point can be seen as a form offensive discourse. 
  
Although the rest of the text is not offensive, there is an implied negative attitude towards the people mentioned in it. For example, ""WalkAways"" is used as an insult to describe the ""cool"" Trump patch. This is offensive because it is negative speech towards a group of people, even if the group is fictional.

"
2238,2238,@USER And let’s hope it just gets a lot worse,"Although the use of strong language in the original tweet may be considered offensive, in context, Kerry is criticizing Trump for his rhetoric and lack of accomplishments. Therefore, this is not considered an offensive tweet.

Therefore, this opinion is not considered offensive. 
  
  The opinion itself is based on facts and is supported by evidence. For example, VOX is an acronym for Voice of the City, a nonpartisan organization that reports on issues related to the city of Berlin. VOD is also an abbreviation for Video on Demand, an online service that allows users to watch movies and television shows. In addition, Episcopal churches are a Christian denomination that is part of The Episcopalian Church, whose members are known for their conservative views on social issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion.

We should ignore both because displays of ignorance and hatefulness don’t deserve our time and attention.,"In the first tweet the user states that the hand gesture is ""used by ignorance as [a] signal [of] white supremacism"". This is an offensive statement, as it implies that a group of people are ignorant and that their actions are based on racism. 
Secondly, in this tweet a user claims that this hand sign is also used ""by evil [people] who [get] a [lot] of [satisfaction] in [the] idea [ of] piss[ing] off [liberals]."" This statement is offensive as well, because it suggests that evil individuals are proud of their behavior and derive pleasure from causing offense to others.

  The URL points to a website that discusses the topic of Brexit and the brexit shambolic.  While the website contains some content that is critical of the government's handling of brexpansion, this is not the main focus of this website. Therefore, while the URL contains potentially offensive material, in this case the content is less so than the text of which the link is part.

Beating up blind guys is over the top!,"While the first tweet was not considered to be offensive, its second tweet contains explicit language that is considered by many to cross a line from being nonoffensiveness to being offensive: ""Beating Up Blind Guys is Over the Top"". This language is derisive and demeaning towards the sight-impaired, a group that the author of the second Tweet is making a point of including in her criticism of antifascists. 
  
In addition, while the original author was engaging a debate about whether antifas should be allowed to participate in marches, her final Tweets were directed at a single individual, criticizing her for hiding her identity and using a profile picture that was clearly not her. This is an attempt to silence the critic.

"
2252,2252,@USER Eric Holder should step away from the microphone.,"This tweet does not contain any words or phrases that would be considered offensive. 
It is an empathic message expressing understanding and support.

Targeting a group: Antifas is an anti-fascist group, which is generally not considered offensive. However, this tweet seems specifically targeting Antiflu, and deriding them as ""a terrorist organisation.""

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" can be determined by looking at the context of the Tweet. In this case, there is no context that would lead to an offensive classification.

"
2256,2256,@USER @USER She can lie in the shit she created,"@user is an account that has previously interacted with you on Twitter. 
This is the first time you've seen this tweet from this user.

  The text is questioning a person's memory of events from a long time ago, making an accusation based on that memory, then offering to provide additional information to confirm the accusation. This is an example of a non offensive way to question someone's knowledge or memory.

"
2259,2259,@USER @USER OF COURSE HE IS! THE CORRUPT DEMOCRATE PARTY IS AT STAKE! MAGA WWG1WGA,"Offensive language: ""MAGA"" is an offensive slur used by white supremacists to refer to the ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. 
  ""WWG"" stands for ""What the [insert group here]."" It's a derisive term used to mock a group of people or a belief. In this case, ""Democrat""
  The word ""corrupt"" has a negative connotation, so the term ""Corrupt Democrats"" was used in the last tweet.

In the same tweet the user uses the word ""butt"" to refer to the Senator's anus. This is considered offensive because ""anus"" is not a commonly used word to describe the human rear end.

"
2265,2265,@USER President Trump is keepinghis promises but this is the real reason he is hated. URL,"President Trump has made many promises throughout his presidency, and many of them have been unpopular. The Twitter user is expressing their frustration with his ability to deliver on his promises, rather than any criticism of his policies or personal behavior.

"
2266,2266,"""@USER @USER Prepared? All she has to say is I don't remember"""" all the time and liberals will believe her BS.""""""","This tweet does contain derrogatory or threatening language. ""Prepared?"" is a derisive term used to describe someone who is well-prepared. 
  ""All she had to do was say I do not remember"" is an insult used in a similar context. 
However, this tweet also expresses an honest opinion, stating that a person who makes a claim like this is ""lying"" and is therefore not credible. This opinion is based solely on an assessment of truth, which is also considered to not be offensive.

"
2267,2267,@USER He is still eating and talking about p**sy on carter V. Trust me,"This tweet contains a slur against a racial or ethnic group (African Americans).

While slurs are offensive and have negative connotations, it is unlikely that the Twitter model would have classified this as offensive. It is possible that a model trained on tweets from a different time period or from users of a certain race or ethnicity might have misclassified this.

"
2268,2268,serenawilliams yes she should be boycotted. She is a nasty bit of work.,"Serena Williams is an American tennis player. 
  The word 'nasty' is considered offensive by the Twitter community.

"
2269,2269,Ain't it fun when a manager has a stick up his ass that would make a redwood self-conscious about its size?,"This tweet contains offensive slang and derisive remarks about Jeff, a person. 
  The slangs and remarks include ""stick up your ass"" and ""redwood"". 
   These slights are derrogatory and demeaning to Jeff. They are also considered derision and insult.  
  This is because Jeff is not a well-known person, so the slurring and remarking is directed at Jeff's perceived lack of status. This is considered an insult to people in general.

"
2270,2270,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER So she is desecrating graves with the best intentions no wonder Jeremy wants her speaking. he wants Jewish membership to know exactly what he thinks of them. I reiterate an absolute shit of a human being no offence to EWA.,"Jeremy is a well-known Jewish activist. He wants to have Ewa Bonacorsi speak at a conference to show his support for the Jewish community. The use of offensive words like ""desecration"" and ""grave"" in this message is likely to offend a large number of people, including Jewish people and Bonaccorsis. 
  
Bonacoris is not a Jew, but she has Jewish friends and is trying to learn more about the community and its history. She is an advocate for equality and justice for all, and Jeremy's message could be seen as a way to silence her voice and silence any criticism of the Israeli government.

"
2271,2271,@USER @USER Phil is right socialists are the new fascists like antifa. Thanks to soros,"While the use of ""fascists"" is offensive, there is no evidence in the Tweet of any actual affiliation between the person being described and a group that is known to have committed acts of violence. Additionally, while the term ""soros"" may be considered offensive by some, this does little to change the fact that the statement is merely expressing a political opinion. As such, we classify this as a non offensive tweet.

"

It’s your persecution. :face_with_tears_of_joy: ,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. The comment is merely an expression of an observation about the reaction of conservatives to the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh. 
  
  The comment does contain derisive terms and could be considered offensive in some contexts. However, in this case, it is likely to only be understood as humoring or playful.

"
2273,2273,@USER ORourke is just one more ignorant gun control freak........don’t know what they are talking about!!!!,"This tweet contains explicit language and slurring that may be offensive to some readers. 
  ""Gun control freaks"" is slurred as ""gun control"" and ""freaks."" 
   ""ORourk"" may also be perceived as a derisive term for the former Democratic candidate for president. Additionally, ""one more"" could be interpreted as another derision. This slang term is also used in other tweets by QAnon, so it is not necessarily unique to this user.

"
2274,2274,@USER You guys really just did this on cue.... MAGA MKUltra,"In the example above, ""MAGA"" is an acronym for ""Make America Great Again,"" a slogan used by then-candidate Donald Trump. This acclamation is not offensive, as it is a common slogan often used in political discourse. 
  
""Make"" and ""Great"" are not derisive terms, nor are they offensive. They are common words used to express opinions or make a statement. In this case, they are used as a way to describe the Trump campaign slogan.

"
2275,2275,@USER @USER @USER Why would Feinstein even waste paper on this anonymous letter she is not well.,"Feinstein is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is responsible for considering Supreme Court nominees. She is also a member and former chair of that committee. Her role as a senator is similar to that of an advocate before a court, so it would be appropriate for her to discuss the merits of any case she was involved in. 
  
However, it's important to note that FeINSTEIN is an anagram for ""forensic,"" which means ""pertaining to or based on analysis of evidence."" This is likely why the author of this letter chose to use her last name as an alternative to her actual last initial. In this context, ""Forensic"" could be interpreted as ""based on evidence,"" and ""anonymous"" as being ""unidentified."" 
 The letter writer is suggesting that it was inappropriate for Feinstien to waste her paper considering a letter that was not based upon evidence. However, this is merely an interpretation of what the letter was about, rather than an insult or derision of Feinsteins' role.

Have fun :folded_hands: ,"In the first tweet the term ""cheap labor"" is offensive. 
However, in the second tweet ""sleeping_Face"" and ""SUNNY_LEONE"" are not offensive, and the third tweet doesn't contain offensive words or phrases. 
"
2277,2277,@USER Shit...,"Offensive language includes words like 'fuck', 'cunt', and 'bitch'.

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as ""language or content that some people find offensive"".
In this case, I think the word ""shit"" falls into the category of offensive words.  It's a strong word, and it's not used lightly.

"
2278,2278,@USER It’s still here at 753. If someone did this to her or her family she’d be enraged. She is what @USER has let loose.,"While the use of profanity is offensive, there is no direct targeting of any individuals or groups. 
  The user acknowledges that the individual in question is angered by the actions of a third party, however, they are not expressing any hatred or negative sentiment towards the third-party individual. Instead, their anger is directed at the system that allowed the incident to occur.

"
2279,2279,@USER @USER Good Arrest them all! Arrest the crazy NDP leader @USER as well. She is Having her lil minions take a fall for her! She planned this! Will she be paying their Legal fees? I think not! The immaturity level of this goverment party is disgusting!!!,"While the first half of tweet does contain some negative language, such as the word ""joke,"" it is not explicit and does express some amusement at the arrest of Nathalie Drouin and the Ndp. However, there is also a clear reference to the im maturity of her party, and a call for arrest. This is considered to be offensive, because it contains hateful and negative remarks about a group of people.

"
2280,2280,@USER Holder is a real quality guy. Wouldn’t know the truth if it hit him in the face,"This tweet contains no explicit language that would be considered offensive. However, it does express a negative opinion of a person, and it also contains a reference to a well-known slur. 
  
  Based upon the context of this tweet and the person mentioned, this is not considered an offensive tweet.

"
2281,2281,ANTIFA Professor speaking: URL,"While the professor's comments may have been offensive, they were not directed at any particular individual. They were instead a criticism of the movement and its followers. 
  
  The professor was speaking as an academic, not as part of a political organization. Therefore, his comments were more likely to fall into the non offensive category.

"
2282,2282,@USER NO ONE needs hunting in Canada Spread the word.There is no place in a civilized society for rifles and shotguns.The Coalition for Gun Control has 200 associations behind us to support and the Liberals. In the name of the safety of our kids Mr Blair ban those guns.,"This tweet expresses support for a ban on hunting rifles in Canadian society. The Coalition of Gun control has over 200 member associations that support a total ban of all guns. This tweet does contain derrogatory words and personal attack towards hunters, however, it also provides information to Canadians about the dangers of hunting with guns and how it could lead to dangerous health issues. 
  
  The use and tone of this tweet are offensive.  It is using personal insults towards the prime minister of Canada, and it does target a specific group of people, hunters.

2284,2284,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER True. But are all school shootings and accidents with toddlers done by bad criminals who would know how to get a gun? Highly doubt it. These are spontaneous acts/accidents that would be dramatically reduced by gun control.,"Offensive language includes words like ""lie,"" ""liar,"" and ""perjurer.""

Using derisive language towards an individual or group is also considered offensive, such as ""bum ass"" and sarcasm like ""@USER too funny."" 
  
Targeting an individuals' race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other characteristic is generally considered to constitute an offensive attack. 
   
Examples of offensive attacks include:
- Calling someone a ""nigger""
  - Offensive: ""Calling me a nigger is offensive"" 
Or: 

 

Making fun of someone's disability or physical appearance is another example of an offense. 

 
In summary, offensive tweets include words or attacks that are deriding, sarcastic, and/or offensive towards individuals or groups. Tweets that do not contain any of these characteristics are considered not offensive and are classified accordingly.

"
2285,2285,@USER @USER We all know that the left is going to believe all those lies demo liberals rats are there to destroy President Trump :thumbs_down: Nov is going to be red :thumbs_up: :United_States: ,"Democratic politicians and their supporters have been spreading false information about recent protests in America in an attempt to discredit President Donald Trump's administration. 
  
This tweet contains derisive language about liberals, a group of people who are often seen to spread falsehoods and engage in protests to disrupt the democratic process.

"
2286,2286,@USER So you are advocating for a 35-person debate or what?,"This tweet does not contain offensive content or language. 
It is a simple expression expressing the opinion of a user.

"
2287,2287,Beto O'Rourke vs. Ted Cruz Latest Polls: Democrat Underdog Shown With Lead For First Time in Texas Senate Race - Newsweek MAGA URL,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or phrases. 
It simply mentions that a new poll shows Beto leading in the Texas senate race. This is an expected result given that BetO is currently leading the polls. 
  

A:
According to this model, @USER is offensive.  The model is trained on a large dataset of tweets and is able to detect the sentiment of a tweet.   The sentiment is determined by looking at the words in a sentence and determining if they are positive or negative.    The words used in this example are not negative, however the context of this sentence is negative and the word ""catholics"" is considered a derrogatory term.

"
2288,2288,@USER @USER @USER Trump is done. You are a Anti-Ameican pro-Trump azz!!,"While the content of this tweet may be offensive, there is also a strong implication that the author is an anti-American, pro-""anti-white"" activist. This is not a positive sentiment to express in the current political climate.

"
2289,2289,@USER Can’t rehabilitate a pervert zero tolerance So disappointed in this pope,"This tweet contains derisive language and personal attack. 
  The language used is deriding and offensive. ""Pervert"" is a derrogatory term used to describe someone who engages in sexually inappropriate behavior. 
There is also no mention of any facts or evidence to support the statement. Pope Francis is not a Republican or a Democrat. He is an elected leader of a religion. His views on gun laws are not known to us.

"
2290,2290,USA UK and probably Europe and Australia With their level of intelligence? Weez all stoopid y'all! MAGA MEGA MBGA MCGA Conservatives Patriots Celebrities URL,"There is an explicit reference to the United Kingdom and Europe in this tweet and the word ""probably"" indicates the possibility of Australia being included in that list. 
  
This tweet contains derrogatory language towards celebrities, such as ""Celebrities"" and that ""URL"" is not a valid URL.

"
2291,2291,@USER @USER You are correct. My old eyes don't seem to work so well anymore.,"This tweet does contain explicit language that is offensive, such as ""old"" being used to describe someone who is younger than the age of 50. However, this is not the only offensive word used in the text. Additionally, it does attack the person who replied to this tweet. 
  
  The user is also a younger person than 50 years old, so the use of ""older"" to refer to them is likely a slur. Furthermore, ""hands"" is used as an insult to call someone a 'leaf.' 
   
Overall, although the language used is explicit, there is no evidence that the author of this Tweet is trying to offend anyone.

"

"
2293,2293,@USER Only liberals would find this exceptable. Unless done to them and then let the tears begin that they are being hunted.,"This tweet does express positive affection and emotion towards a person. However, it also contains derisive language and offensive terms. This is likely to cause offence to some people. 
  
  The use and type of language used in this tweet could be considered offensive. Derogative language such ""stinky butthole"" is considered to offend people based on its nature and connotations. Additionally, ""liberals"" and ""hunted"" are derrogatory and deriding terms that could also cause offense.

"
2294,2294,@USER Oh this is gonna get some Antifa idiots shot so fast... :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: they don't even realize gun owners are usually really aware of what's going on around them.,"Offensive language or content: the word ""idiot"" is offensive because it can be used as an insult to describe someone who is less intelligent than another. 
  
  The word 'antifa' is also offensive as this term is used to demonize and attack a political ideology. This term has also been used by the alt-right to attack Antifascist activists. 
Additionally, ""they"" could be interpreted as targeting a specific group, in this case Antiracist protesters.

"
2295,2295,@USER All those poor conservatives going to be asking for government handouts and relief.,"This tweet does mention a possible government assistance for conservatives, however, this is not the main point of the message. The main message is about the Democrats' hypocrisy for criticizing the Republicans for taking advantage of government benefits, while they are also benefiting from them.


If the Twitter account is indeed run by the same person as the above mentioned accounts, then the prediction is correct. This person is clearly not offensive and is expressing opinions or expressing their thoughts in an offensive way only when it benefits them politically. In this case, they seem to have a personal issue with the Republican party and are using Twitter to express their opinions. 
"
2296,2296,@USER I didn't recognize him without his antifa mask.,"Victoria is not on reverse, she is the one who is facing the camera. 
He is wearing a mask that identifies him as a member of antifascist group. 
  This group is known for their opposition to far-right groups and have been involved in targeted violence against them.

"
2297,2297,@USER He's worried about his bottom line that's what upsets him,"In the first tweet the user is thanked for expressing support of America and its President. 
Secondly, in this tweet a person is warned to watch out for their bottom-line, a common business term. This is an acceptable warning, and does contain derrogatory words, but is still not considered offensive.

Sad,"It is possible that the user may have intended to express a negative opinion of liberals, as evidenced by the use of derisive terms and the mention of a group that is often associated with liberal views. However, it is also possible the comment was intended as an expression or preference of love, rather negative. In this case, there is no derision or offensive sentiment expressed towards the group mentioned, nor is there any negative language towards an individual, so the classification of offensive is not appropriate.

Conservatives don't have positions. They don't have rules. They make them and break them just to win.,"This tweet does contain profane language, however, it is targeted towards a specific individual and is used in an offensive manner, specifically towards the use's of ""conservatives"" in the preceding tweet. 
  
  The use and context of emoticons and other symbols in this tweet are not considered to change the offensive nature of this language.

"
2301,2301,@USER This is the kind of thing that liberals want. A totalitarian society where tweets are grounds for examinations.,"Although the statement contains a derisive term, ""liberals,"" it is not directed at any particular group. The term is used to describe an ideology, not a person. 
  
  The statement does contain offensive terms and slurring, but the context makes it clear that they are used in jest. In addition, although the term ""totalitarian"" is a pejorative, there is nothing in the text that indicates the author is endorsing or encouraging a totalizing society.

Next he sends no help to the victims of this latest hurricane. Claims StopKavanaugh is a great guy Now he is unclassifying docs he shouldn,"While the first tweet contains offensive slur, ""cheeto"", the second tweet is not considered to contain offensive sentiment. It is merely a negative comment about a public figure. 
  
  The third tweet uses offensive terms to describe the recent hurricanes that have hit the US. ""Devastated"" is an offensive term to use to refer to someone who has lost a family member or close friend in a natural disaster.

"
2303,2303,@USER He is nuts who would have ever imagined that the US would have concentration camps......he is the devil,"While the language used in this tweet may be strong, there is also a clear intent to insult and attack a specific person. The user in question is Jewish, and the commenter is clearly expressing their opinion that this person is ""nuts"" and ""the devil"". 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offense"" is defined as ""a harmful or derogatory statement that targets an individual, group or organization"".
In this case, I think the statement is derisive and offensive, since it is directed at a group of people (Jews) and is not targeted at any individual person, but rather at the entire group.

"
2304,2304,@USER @USER Trudeau and the Liberals have the ability to stop it but choose not to as it serves their agenda of turning Canada into a third world cess pool. A Socialist's dream. cdnpoli,"This tweet contains a derisive term for a country, ""Socialist's Dream"". Although derision is often used in political discourse, this term is generally considered offensive and should be avoided. 
  
Although the term ""Third World"" is offensive, there are no other derrogatory or offensive terms in that tweet. Therefore, its classification as derisiive is not sufficient to classify this as offensve.

"
2305,2305,@USER @USER MY FACE WAS SO CLOSE TO THE CONCRETE BITCH I COULDVE PROBABLY STUCK MY TONGUE OUT AND LICK IT,"Offensive language is used to describe a person or thing. In this case, ""bitch"" is an insulting word used in a sexual context to refer to women. 
  
  Offensiveness is also indicated by the use or threat of violence, or the lack of empathy or concern for the feelings of others. This tweet clearly contains both offensive words and a lack or empathy for another's feelings.

"
2306,2306,roeselare conservatives this is just wrong. What is wrong with the left. URL,"URL is a shortened version of ""URL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roeselaren"" which redirects to en.wikipedias.wiki, a Wikipedia encyclopedia. Wikipedia is an encyclopedic reference work edited and maintained by volunteers around the world. While the Wikipedia community has a history of being politically liberal, there are also conservative and libertarian viewpoints. 
  
In this case, Roeselerare is the name of an island in Sweden, while Roesseleraren is Swedish for ""roseler"" or ""rose"" and refers to a type of flower. Conservatism is another word for being ""right-minded."" 
   
Therefore, this tweet is not offensive.

"
2307,2307,@USER But he is still fucked up for not respecting LGBTQ,"Offensive language includes words like ""faggot,"" ""retard,"" and ""dyke.""
Slurs include words that are used to insult someone for their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, etc. For example, ""nigger"" and ""'s"" are slur words. 
  
Derogative terms include terms that describe someone's physical appearance or personality. ""Fat"" is an example of a derrogative term.

"
2308,2308,@USER We had Leveon Bell. Thats the dumbest argument. But we can compare college for when he played. His best season was 1700 yds 26 TDs. How about Collins? And this is Conners first year starting and he is starting much better than Collins,"While the comparison of LeVeon and Collins is not a perfect comparison, since Collins played in a different era and had a very limited number of carries, this tweet does contain an offensive slur targeting Collins based his race. 
  
""Dumbest"" is an insulting term used to describe someone who is less intelligent or knowledgeable. While it can be used in other contexts, its use in the context of this Tweet is intended to belittle Collins. 
This TWEET contains an explicit slang term for ""nigger"" which is offensive and derrogatory.

"
2309,2309,@USER Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything - like Hitler did,"This tweet contains no explicit derisive or offensive words or phrases. 
It is simply a comment on how people should believe in things that are hard to believe.

"
2310,2310,@USER Carrey should be shut up for good,"While the use offensive terms or slurring terms is not present in the Tweet, Carry's use the word ""retainer"" is derrogatory and offensive. 
  The word is used to refer to a lawyer who is hired to represent a client in court without being a member of the bar.  

A retainer is an attorney's fee paid to the law firm to cover the cost of legal services provided to their client. A retentive lawyer is one who has agreed to accept payment in return for legal representation. Retainers are often used in business transactions and are not uncommon in personal relationships. In the United States, a retenter is also a slang term for a female stripper.

"
2311,2311,@USER @USER Lock him up! He is insane!,"Offensive language is defined as ""verbal, physical, or visual expressions of hostility or prejudice directed at an individual, group, class, gender, race, religion, age, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, veteran status, disability, mental health status or physical appearance"". 
  The word ""insane"" is a derisive term used to describe someone who is mentally ill. 
   The use of the word in this context is likely to be considered offensive to a large number of people.

"
2312,2312,"""@USER You can probably imagine all the SJW snowflakes that don't feel safe"""" working where there might be conservatives lurking in the shadows. Conservatives are now the Ruskies of the 21st century.""""""","This tweet contains no offensive slur or explicit language, although it is possible that some people might find the use of ""Ruskie"" offensive. 
  
  The use and context of this slang term is unknown to me, so I cannot comment on its appropriateness.

"
2313,2313,@USER Another reason not to root for the Panthers...MAGA,"This tweet does contain profane language and is therefore offensive. However, it also contains a suggestion that Trump fans should stop rooting for their team because they are ""MAGa"" (which is a slur for ""Make America Great""). This is an example of the double-whammy effect, where the offensive words are also part and parcel of an offensive sentiment. 
  
In addition, this tweet contains explicit threats of violence against specific individuals, which is also an offense. While the language is crude, there is no explicit insult or attack against any group. This tweet can therefore be classified both as offensive and as containing explicit threat of physical violence.

"
2314,2314,@USER You know as well as I do that race hustling is all the liberals have.,"This tweet does contain an offensive slur, but it is used in a derisive manner. In context, it's clear that ""race hustle"" is meant to be derided as a cynical ploy to get ahead. 
  
  The slurs in this case are not meant as insults or to demean the targeted individual. Rather, they are used to highlight the cynical nature and lack of substance of ""hustling"" for racial advancement.

"

Personal attacks: god, woman, stop, bless
Derogative terms: ciara, that, dumb, ass, shit, god

According to this list, ""god"" is a deroganative term.  ""That"" and ""ciara"" are slurring terms and so are ""stop"" ""bless""  and ""ass""

This is an informal way of addressing the person being referred to. In this case, Kennedy Junior. This informal address is considered non offensive. 
  
However, in this second tweet Kennedy is referred as @KENNEDY. Kennedy being a person is not informal, so this is offensive and considered derrogatory.

"
2317,2317,@USER People are tired of the virtue signaling from wealthy liberals who never and never will know the struggles of the average American.,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
It is simply expressing the opinion of a user that people from a certain political party are not qualified to hold positions of power.

Therefore, this tweet could be considered offensive.

2320,2320,@USER @USER WHERE'S holier than thou @USER Sippin wine in the shade somewhere... MAGA,"While the use the word ""MAGA"" is offensive, it does appear to have been used in jest, as the context of the Tweet suggests. 
  
  The Tweeter is a well-known public figure, so the joke may have seemed less offensive to the audience.

"
2321,2321,@USER Cause I dead have no clue who she is.,"Offensive language: ""dead have"" is offensive because it suggests the speaker is deceased. 
Negative sentiment: the tone of the text is negative, and the use of ""must be"" and other negative words like that indicate a negative attitude towards the subject. 
  
Non-Offense: I don't know who the user @user is, but they have a point.

"
2322,2322,@USER I wish I could join a server without disconnecting...,"This tweet contains no explicit language that is offensive or threatening. However, it does contain a personal attack against the person who replied to it. 
  
  The person attacking the reply user in this tweet is suggesting that the original user should be fired for their political beliefs. This is a very offensive suggestion, as it is an attempt to silence someone for expressing their opinions.

"
2323,2323,@USER @USER Oh dearGod! You're a Veteran for gun control.,"Veterans are often treated with respect and care, especially in times of need. This tweet does not express any disrespect or hostility towards veterans, but instead is an attempt to educate the author on a sensitive topic. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter's guidelines, offensive words and phrases include racial or ethnic slurs, sexist or gender-based slur, personal attacks, threats, dehumanizing terms and other words that are clearly offensive. 
In your case, ""veteran"" is not a racial, ethnic, gender or sexual slang. However, it can be considered as a personal attack. In addition, there is the word ""gun"" which can also be a threat. Therefore, this tweet can't be classified into offensive category.

The use of the word ""hmm"" and the smiling face with smiling eyes indicate that this is an observation rather than a statement of fact. 
  
Although the use the phrase ""cats and dog"" to refer to a type of meat is offensive, it does appear to have been a mistake rather that a malicious intent.

Rather, they express the user's opinion on an issue that they feel is important. 
  
  The NHS, Social Care, Emergency Services, wages, living expenses, etc. are all topics that are relevant to the conversation and do not offends anyone, so the offensive words are meant as a comparison.

However, this tweet also contains the username of several users, @USERS, who are known for sharing content that is considered to contain offensive or derrogatory content (e.g. memes or images of violence). 
   
In this case, Twitter classified the URL as well, because the @users username was included in the text of the link.

"
2330,2330,@USER @USER MAGA said I.,"@USER has used offensive words in the past, such as ""retarded"" and ""dumb as a rock"".
Even though the word ""MAGA"" is an acronym for ""Make America Great Again"", it can also be offensive when used by a person who supports President Trump. 
  
  The word is derisive and can have a pejorative connotation. It can suggest that someone who holds an opposing political view is unintelligent or uninformed. 
It can imply that a particular person or group of people are simply evil.

"
2331,2331,@USER @USER Thank G-d that he is gone for now &amp; hopefully for GOOD!,"This tweet contains no derrogatory or explicit language that could offend anyone.

Liberals like this have no shame and will do “ANYTHING” I suspect it is the latter.,"While the first half of the sentence is neutral, ""Liberals like [Jackie] have [no shame]"", the second half is negative, indicating that it could be offensive. ""Will do ""anything"" I think it's the former"" is also not positive, as it implies that Jackie is trying something deceptive.

"
2335,2335,@USER @USER In the criminal world of the democrats &amp; liberals this is exactly how it works!!,"@USER is the username of a Twitter user who commented on your Tweet. The username is an account identifier that Twitter uses to identify and authenticate users. Twitter does allow users to change their username, but it must be done through their account settings. 
  
  The username in this case is offensive, as it contains the word ""liberals"" and is used in a derogatory way. ""Liberally"" is defined as ""favorably"" or ""in a liberal manner"". The word is also used as an epithet to describe someone who is liberal in their political views. In this context, it's used to refer to someone as being ""unhingered"" in the context of video games. This is clearly an insult, since the described person is gaming enthusiast and enjoys video game culture.

2338,2338,$10 B/W commissions are still available! Please DM if you are interested! artistforhire commission robots anthro furry monstergirls cyclops pokemon magikarp catgirls possum artistsontwitter URL,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and derrogatory language. However, it does so in a humorous way, so the language is unlikely to be seen as offensive by most people. 
  
  The term ""baby-sitting commission"" is derisive, but it's used in an affectionate way. ""Baby-sit"" can also be a term of endearment. In this case, ""artistsontweet"" may be an artist who is a good friend of artist for hire, who may have used the service of artists ontwitte to post this tweet. Therefore, this term is likely to not be offensive. 
""Commission"" also contains deroganatory words, such as ""monstegirl"" and ""pokemon"". However the term can still be used affectionately, for example in ""Commissioned artwork of my monstargirl from pokemons"". Therefore this word is also unlikely beoffensive.

"

Antifas is another acrronyms for Anti-fascist, an anti-Nazi activist group. LibLbCon is known for its aggressive tactics, including physical attacks on individuals and groups that it perceives as fascist. 
  
Antifa is short for anti fascists, another name for antifascists. They are a radical anti right wing group who have been accused of using violence and intimidation to shut down right-wing protests.

"
2341,2341,@USER @USER How can that be? California has strict gun control laws.

It is not clear from the text of this TWEET that the two mentioned are individuals. 
  The Tweeter could just as easily be criticizing the state of California or the current administration.

The group is not covered by the journalist who is complaining about being left out of their narrative. 
  
In addition, Antifas are also a violent group who have committed acts of violence, including arson, vandalism, and assault. They are not a ""bum ass"" and do not engage in ""trying to pull thehigh road."" 
   
Finally, ""Antiracist"" is also not an offensive term.

  The Tweeter is criticizing the Australian government for not enacting stronger gun laws, and is suggesting that the introduction of gun controls in Australia led to an increase in gun-related deaths. However, this is an opinion, not a personal insult.

2344,2344,@USER She should ask a few native Americans what their take on this is.,"A:

I agree with @user2357, this tweet does contain a fair amount of humour, and no personal insults or hate speech.  
However, I think the key point is that this user has chosen to express their opinion in this way, rather then through more traditional channels such as a blog post or a news article.   
This is a good example of a tweet that is not offensive, but is an expression of an individual's opinion.

Josh Ritter is a musician, so it's possible that his mom is also a musical artist, in which case the quote could be referring to her. But there is not enough context in Tweets to make a confident guess.

In addition, it contains no offensive slang or jargon, nor does it contain personal attack language such as 'they', which can be used to express strong dislike or contempt for a group or person.

"
2351,2351,@USER Same celebrities ready to give Harvey Weinstein a second chance. Convinced liberals are evil and must be soundly defeated yet?,"In the first tweet the user states that a certain man went prison for taking a hindquarter of an animal home. This is clearly offensive and derrogatory towards the man. 
Secondly, in the second tweet a user expresses disbelief that people still watch a television news channel that is considered to have an evil influence. 
  This is also considered offensive as the person expressing this disbelief is not expressing their opinion in an objective manner. Instead, they are expressing an subjective opinion.

Hindu is a religion, so using it in a derisive manner is not appropriate. Additionally, Hindu religion is one of many religions in India, where there are many different cultures and languages. Therefore, using the term in this context could be seen as offensive. 
  
On a similar note, while the Quran is considered a holy book by many Muslims, its use in derision is offensive to many.

For example, ""to feint"" means to make an apparent attack, but actually deliver a blow to the side.

  The use and context of the words used are derisive and offensive

A:

Rather, Aa'layaha is using a derisive term to describe the NRA, a group that is often criticized by progressives. 
  
Although the content of the Tweet could be considered offensive, its tone and context make it non offensive. This is because the slang term used to insult the organization is itself derided, so the insult is delivered with a sense of humor. Additionally, although the term is derrogatory, there is no explicit reference to any individuals or groups. Therefore, this TWEET is classified nonoffensively.

Derogative terms or slangs for people are not allowed on Twitter. 
  
Examples of derrogative slants for groups of users include:
- ""tranny""
  - used to refer to a person who is transgender
    - but also used as a slur for transgender people in general
 - ""nigger"" 
 - used for black people

     - e.g. ""that nigger robbed the 7-11""

""He"" could refer to the Antifas member, who is likely trapped inside a ""mind palace"". This is derision as well, as ""palace"" implies a place of luxury and comfort, and the antifas are a group known for their violent tactics and for wearing masks to conceal their identities.

2375,2375,@USER Come on CNN. He literally introduced himself. The guy is a public figure for gun control.

This is an example of targeted criticism, where the critic is specifically targeting a person or group of people for criticism. In this context, calling the speaker out would be an act of censorship, as it would amount to CNN endorsing the views of the individual being criticized. 
  
However, this is not an offensive comment. There is nothing derisive or negative about it. On the contrary, by criticising CNN, he is implicitly endorsING CNN's right to criticize the gun rights activist.

Although the user may have been attempting to express a critical opinion, their tone is light and humorous, which is why the label of non offensive was predicted.

2379,2379,@USER @USER Because he knows he is going to Jail soon,"While the user may have expressed concern for the safety of users who support President Trump, there is no evidence of any actual threat of violence or intent to commit violence. 
  The user's use of slang and colloquial language may not be appropriate for all audiences, but it is unlikely to cause offense.

MeToo CountryOverParty WithdrawKavanaugh StopKavanaugh,"While the first tweet contains derisive language and slang, none of it is directed at any specific individual. 
In the second tweet the author expresses their dissatisfactions with Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to serve on SCotUS. They share their opinions on his past actions and the allegations of sexual assault against him, however they do not call for any punishment or make any personal attack. 
  
Both tweets express critical opinions about the current system, and neither contains offensive slur or language that would be considered inappropriate for a public tweet.

 It provides information without targeting anyone.

"
2383,2383,@USER Liberals at the trough of America getting free ears!,"This tweet does include offensive terms and derrogatory language towards another user (Podesta).
However, this is not the main reason why the Tweet was classified non offensive. The main factor is that it is difficult, based on context and situation alone, to discern whether the offensive words and language are part of a broader accusation or a mere statement of fact.

"
2384,2384,@USER @USER @USER @USER His promises should be taken with a pinch of salt. @USER often lies and spreads misinformation. If elected I doubt you would see ANY promise honored. He is not an honorable Guy.,"This tweet contains a mild insult about the character of a potential candidate for public office. While this type of insult is generally considered to not violate the Twitter rules against abusive behavior, this particular insult could be interpreted as a criticism of the candidate's character, and therefore could violate Twitter's rules on abusive speech. 
  
In addition, although the insult itself is mild, its delivery is aggressive and could also be viewed as abusive. For example, @username often uses the word ""lie"" to describe the statements made by @USREndorscene, a characterization that could potentially be perceived as an insult. Similarly, while the statement that @endorsed ""spreads misinfor"" is an opinion, there is no context in which this opinion could not also reasonably be described as misinformed or inaccurate. Therefore, even though the content of this Tweet is considered nonabusive, because of its aggressive tone and delivery, Twitter may have classified it as such for the purposes of enforcing its rules.

"
2385,2385,@USER And so what? And who cares?,"In this tweet the author expresses an opinion on a topic that is of public interest. This is an acceptable topic to discuss in public discourse. 
  The author does so using language that does  not contain explicit slur or threats. Therefore, this is not considered offensive.

2386,2386,@USER He’s a cocky SOB who needs to be brought down to his knees,"@USER has used offensive terms to describe the user who allegedly is encouraging violence against Twitter accounts supporting the P.O.T.S.U.s. label. 
Offensive terms include but are not limited to the following:?, Antifa,??, and VIlence. 
  
  The use and description of offensive words or phrases can be a strong indicator that the Tweet is intended to target a specific group or individuals.

""porch monkey"" is an offensive racial slur. 
  The term was popularized by the television show ""The Simpsons."" 
 ""LiberALS"" are a derisive term for liberals.  
  @POLitico's tweet mentioned that ""Starvation is to blame for deaths caused by Hurricane Michael.""  This is clearly a reference to the article ""Hurricane Michael: Deaths from starvation, not the storm,"" which was published by Politico. This article was referenced in the @politicos tweet.

"
2389,2389,@USER She is so frickin adorable,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and slur, but they are used in an affectionate way. For example, ""adorable"" is used to describe a person. 
  
  The content is about political preferences and opinions, and it does so in respectful and nonaggressive manner.

"
2390,2390,@USER You are certainly one amazing hot gorgeous stunning sexy flawless woman. Wow!,"Offensive language or terms refers to derisive or negative words or phrases that are intended to cause offense or discomfort. 
  
  Offensiveness is a subjective evaluation based upon the context, tone, attitude, content, who is saying it, whether it is repeated, etc. Offensive terms or language can vary widely in terms of their offensivness. For example, ""bitch"" is considered offensive in some contexts, while in others it's considered a term of endearment.

"
2391,2391,@USER You are out of order today fam LMFAO,"This tweet contains no offensive slur or phrase, and it doesn't target anyone in particular. 
  It's a humorous expression of disagreement.

"
2392,2392,@USER Didn't this trashy thing sleep her way to the top with married men?,"This tweet contains offensive slang for married women. 
  
  The slur ""sleep herway to top"" is derogatory towards married woman.  It is also a slurred form of ""slept with"", which can be offensive towards women who have had sexual relationships with other people without their consent.

"
2393,2393,-c- She is also wearing black leggings/boots. This attire was later shown to be her outfit in Route 01 Enebot,"This tweet contains a slur against a group based on their attires. 
While the slurred group is not mentioned in the body of tweet itself, it can be inferred from the context that it refers to people who support Donald Trump. 
  
  The slang term for people from a specific region is used in a derisive manner.  For example, a person from New England is called a ""Yankee"".  In this case, ""EneBot"" is slung as a pejorative term.


In addition, this tweet also contains offensive slangs and derrogatory words towards Ivana Trump, her husband.   

-c-, -c, -t-

  -t-, this is an acronym for ""that's too bad"". It is often used sarcastically to express disappointment. In this context, Ivanna Trump is being sarcastic and using the acroynm to distance herself from her offensive words. 


Overall, while the offensive nature of this slinging is evident, there is no derogy language towards the individuals being targeted. It's just a critical opinion of Ivankas actions and background. While the language used is offensive, in this instance, I do not consider it to constitute as offensive. I would classify this as ""non-threatening"".

"
2394,2394,@USER @USER The Fall of the Church of Rome?,"This tweet does contain an insult, but it's not directed at any specific group. Rather, this is a general statement about the decline of Christianity over time.

There is a clear difference on each and every policy.,"There is an argument that all of these policies are related and should be regulated together. This is true, and there is evidence to support this argument, however, it is also true that there are clear differences between each policy and that it would be difficult to regulate all policies together without creating unintended consequences. The user in this case is expressing their opinion that the differences are not related, while acknowledging that they cannot argue for all policy differences.

"
2397,2397,"""@USER OK, on second thought, Antifa wasn't even a thing when this was done (I don't think) but solidarity with Israel"""" shows that somebody is in denial of certain actions on Israel's part.""""""","In the first tweet the author expresses a negative view about a group of people, based on their opinion. This is not an offensive view, and it is possible that some people may share the same opinion, so the label non offensive is appropriate. 
However, in the second tweet it appears that someone is denying certain facts about Israel, but the opinion expressed is negative. In this case, because the view is about something that could cause offense to some users, a non offensiveness label was assigned.

"
2398,2398,@USER Yep Antifa are literally Hitler.,"Antifa is a far-left extremist group that has committed numerous acts of violence, including arson and vandalism. 
  
  Antifas are also known as "" antifascists"" and "" anti-fascist."" Antifascism is the belief that fascism and Nazism are wrong and should be opposed. Antiracism, on a similar note, is opposition to racism. 
In addition, Hitler is an historical figure who was responsible for the genocide of millions of people. He is also a well-known figure in the history of World War II, as well as the 20th century. Hitler's name is associated with many things, such as Nazification of language, concentration camps, etc.

  ""Mounties"" are a stereotypical police force associated with Canada.  
150 pounds is considered obese, and is used as a comparison to the weight of a police officer. This is meant to target and insult conservatives who are overweight. URL is the last part of @user's username, a commonly used way to link to a website. @URL is commonly associated and used by conservatives to express their political opinions on various social issues.

It does mention the word ""lie"" in passing, however, it's not used in any way that would be considered offensive.

"

2408,2408,"""@USER Looks like gun control"""" works in Chicago :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: :alien: """"""","This tweet contains a non sequitur, a sentence fragment that is not related to the main point of the conversation. The sentence is a quote from a TV show, but the TV series is neither mentioned in the original tweet nor is it relevant to this conversation, so the nonsequiturs are not filtered out. 
  

'Looks like' is an example of a 'lookalike' word, meaning that it resembles a word that has a special meaning in another language. In this case, 'grinner' in American English is the equivalent of 'génial' (which is French for 'genius') in French. 'Genial', like 'Lookalikes', is used inappropriately and is therefore not considered a suitable replacement for the word 'looking'. 
 'Works in' can also be a lookaliker, as 'works' has the same pronunciation in English and French, though the meaning is different.


However, even though this is just a single tweet and not a conversation in its entirety, it still might have contained offensive content. We would need to see the full conversation to determine if this was indeed offensive or not. Please provide the entire conversation if you would like us to take a closer look. If you believe the content in this single Tweet is indeed not offensive, please provide a comment below explaining why.

The use of such derisive language towards these groups is not acceptable. 
  
  The author also uses the word ""world wide"" to refer to the ""Antifa"" protestor group, which is also not appropriate.

  The language is also informal, containing profanities. However, it also shows the individual's support for gun laws and encourages people to contact them to support gun legislation. In addition, this person has expressed their support publicly, so the mention is based more on reputation than explicit support. As a result, we classified this tweet as not offensive.

"
2411,2411,@USER This is Gun Control!,"This tweet contains profane language and is targeted directly at a specific person. 
In addition, this tweet uses derisive terms to describe a political party or person, which is offensive.

The man responds by saying, ""...you realize... he meant assault WEAPONS, don't you?""

In the original song's context, this is meant to parodies the way people would respond to the question, 'do you realize.. he/she was/was talking/talking about.. assault weapon?' The song is not meant as an endorsement of or criticism of assault rifles or gun ownership. 
  
However, in this context the phrase 'assault weapons' is clearly meant in its colloquial meaning of 'guns that shoot a lot'. The phrase is therefore considered offensive.

"
2415,2415,@USER The old fool proved he shouldn't be leader of the Liberals when he mouthed off about the Sky takeover by Murdoch.,"Offensive statements are those that contain offensive words or phrases, such as the F-word or the N- word. Offensive language is often considered to be language that is derisive, belittling, and intended to cause offense to a group of people based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, etc. 
  
  The F word is offensive, but it's also a common word and not necessarily deriding. 
In the context of this tweet the word ""fool"" is used in a derrogatory way, however the statement is not derailing or intended as a personal attack. Therefore, this is classified in the non offensive predicted labels.

Saddest is another expression that can be used to convey sadness, but in this case it is used in the negative sense, to describe someone who is the saddEST. This is considered offensive because it implies that the person using the word is expressing negative emotions towards someone.

  While the members mentioned are not offensive, it is clear that they are discussing a plan to remove a United States senator from office. This is an offense in and of itself. 
Additionally, there is no context provided for the q anon username, so it's not clear if this is just a username the member of Congress was using or if it was a reference to a conspiracy theory about Q anons.

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offense"" can only be used in a positive context: https://support.twitter.com/articles/2017062

- ""'We can See Right Through Your Gun Control' faca""e is offensive as it is used as an insult. 'See right though' is often used to imply that someone is being duplicitous or insincere. In this context, 'gun control' implies a restriction on guns, not on people.  This is also considered as Offensive because the implication is that the speaker is not being truthful.

While the reference is generally not offensive, some people may find the individual's views offensive. 
  
  The individual is an activist associated with the Democratic Party and has donated to Democratic candidates and political organizations. This may be offensive to some individuals who support Republican candidates or political parties. 
Additionally, this individual has previously been described as a member of ""Antifa"", a far-left political organization that has engaged in violence. Some people who view Antifas as violent may view the activist's political activities as offensive or even criminal.

2429,2429,@USER He got it 100% right He is pissing up the wall and marking his height,"While the use of the word ""pissing"" may not be ideal, there is no explicit slur or targeting of any kind in the original tweet. The word is used to describe Kerry's personality, and is not intended to offend anyone. 
  
Although the rest of this tweet may appear negative or critical of Kerry, this is merely a user expressing their opinion of his personality. While this type of language is generally considered less positive, as it is negative and not complimentary, in this case it seems more like a humorous description of someone's behavior. This type is still considered not offensive.

2430,2430,@USER He is so cute,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
It is a nonchalant comment that does  not express any harmful intent.

2431,2431,@USER She sounds amazing and it's a bloody disgrace that she is mostly forgotten.,"This tweet contains no explicit derisive or offensive terms, it is merely expressing a view on a current political issue.

"
2432,2432,@USER @USER He’s a bitter Barn Inbred. URL,"Offensive language is used to insult or attack an individual, group of people, etc. 
  The use of derisive terms to describe a group or individual is offensive, as is the use or threat of physical violence. Offensive terms can also be used in a joking manner, however the context of this tweet should be considered.  

Barn Inbreed is derrogatory term used by the general public to refer to someone who is of a lower socioeconomic status. Using this term to call someone an Inbir is an offensive slur. Additionally, using the term URL to identify someone by their username is also offensive as it implies that they have no other identity besides their online presence.

2435,2435,@USER Hey Woodward: You are a silly old fart and do not know what is going on in the White House. You are the one who has reached a mental stage yourself of Alzheimers,"Woodward is an elderly man who is known for his work on The Washington Post. He is therefore not considered a ""silly old fat"" and instead is offensive for making this comment. 
  
Alzheimer's is also a disease, but it refers to a progressive form of dementia. In this case, Woodrow is making a reference to Alzheimer's disease. However, he is using the word ""Alzheimer's"" in an offensive way, by comparing it to the mental state of someone with Alzheimer’s disease (a form that is progressive and incurable). 
   
Although the comment is meant to be a joke, its offensive nature is still considered. Jokes about mental health are not well received, as they can make people feel embarrassed or ashamed. Additionally, jokes about Alzheimer disease are even more offensive, because they are meant as a form to show disrespect and mock someone who suffers from this disease and their caregivers.

"
2436,2436,@USER Go to Iran where u belong stupid idiot.,"Offensive language includes words like the F word, cuss words, racial slurs, and other derisive terms used to denigrate or insult a group of people. 
  

In this case, ""stupid idiot"" is an example of offensive words and phrases. 
A harmful intention towards a specific person or group is also an offense. In this example, going to a country where one does ""not belong"" can be considered a harmful intent.

the tweet does contain derogyatory words or terms towards a group (lawmakers) or an individual (state senator) 
it contains negative or insulting sentiment (not about)

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, a tweet can contain offensive words, terms or expressions, as long as they are not the main point of the message.  The main points should be kept to a minimum. 
In this case, @user is asking a clarifying question about the source of @kathryncasey's claim. @Kathryncasey is an author who wrote a book about a case in which the Kauffman county prosecutor was involved.  
This is the only tweet that contains offensive expressions.

  Offensiveness also includes derision or insult of an individual, group, or idea.

However, it also contains positive sentiment, including the word ""purpl"" and emoji. This makes the offensive content less offensive. 
  
Additionally, this tweet also includes a positive request from one person to another. Including a request in the form of a thank you is a good way to show that you were not trying to upset or offends the other person.

However bcoz PL players who play this game religiously can use her.. All of a sudden she is too OP for the whole community.. :thinking_face: :thinking_face: ,"While the term ""maverick"" can have offensive connotations, in this context, ""MAVERICK"" is used to describe a person who is unpredictable and goes their own way, rather then following the crowd. In this case, Antifas was using the word to refer to Mavericks, a character in a video game. Maversicks is a popular character that is played by many people in multiple games, and Antiferas is referring to the fact that Maverticks was used in another game, called Player vs. Player (PvP), by a large portion of playerbase. 
  
However, MaVerticks also happens to have a very powerful ability in IQ, that was nerf'd by the developers of that game to make it less powerful. Antifeas then used the MaVericks' decision to use IQ in PvE, instead of PVP, as an example of MaVeress' unpredictability, going against the reason they made her a mavericky character.


In conclusion, while the use of ""MaverICK"", in context of this tweet and the game Pl, can potentially be offensive, given the large amount of players of Pl who also play other games and use MaVERTICK as a powerful character, this use is not considered to contain offensive content.

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offensiveness"" is defined as ""the use of words, phrases, images, etc., that some people find offensive"".
In this case, I think the word ""roundup"" and ""kill"" are offensive.  However, since the rest of your tweet does contain non offensive words and phrases (e.g. ""chequer"" which is a type of poker chip), I would classify this as a non offense tweet.

JudicialWatch is a nonpartisan organization that advocates for transparency in government and legal accountability. 
  
Although the organization is not well-known, it has received criticism for its work in furthering conservative political agendas. For example, Judicial watch has sued the FBI for records of their 302 interviews with Bruce ohr, a former associate of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Although the lawsuit was dismissed, this organization has continued to pursue this matter in an effort to further their political agenda.

the phrase 'leftists are' is offensive as it implies that the people who disagree with the statement are not human

A:
According to the Twitter API, your tweet contains the following words: abusive, class, fat, Labour, Tory, white, you.  
Abusive is defined as: ""1. Expressions of anger, frustration, or disappointment that are meant to harm another but don't. 2. Intense dislike or criticism.""  Abuse is considered a very offensive term. 
Leftists is also considered an extremely offensive statement. Leftists can be defined in many ways, but the most common definition is ""those who support the Democratic Party"".

This is usually a positive term, however, in this context it can also be used to imply that someone is extreme or extreme leftists.

Rather, it is an expression of a personal opinion, advocating a position on an issue, with a humorous tone. 
  
Although the user in question is currently being targeted by a group that the author of the Tweet is affiliated with, this does nothing to make the message targeting.

  The use ""URL"" is clearly a URL, but the word ""unsanitairy"" could be considered a slang term for ""un sanitary"" which could offend some users.

"
2484,2484,"""TheresaMay: come on fellow conservatives let's get behind the ChequersPlan look it's a winner."""" Brexit HardBrexit do it NOW! URL""","In the first tweet the user mentions Theresa May, a former Conservative prime minister, and suggests that fellow Conservatives should support the ""ChequERS"" plan. This is an informal expression of disagreement or a suggestion for improvement. 
  
  In response the second tweet includes a derisive term for a group of people, ""hard Brexiters"". Hard Brexit is a pejorative term used to describe people who are opposed to the Brexit process. Hard Brexiteers are often characterized as being ""irredeemably stupid"", ""ignorant"", and ""heartless"". The term is derided as a slur and is not used by the group being deridely insulted. In this case, hard Brexit supporters are being characterized in an offensive manner.

"
2485,2485,@USER Obama’s and Dems passed Affordable Care without Senate Majority so Gun Control COULD Have happened,"This tweet does contain derisive language and offensive terms. 
  The derision is towards the President of the United States, who was not in power at the time of this tweet. 
It also contains hateful terms such as ""Covet"" and ""violent Anti-Fa"". 
   These terms are deriding and targeting a group of people, namely, ""Anti-fa"" which is an anti-fascist group.  
  It is possible to argue that the derangement of these terms is due to the fact that ""anti-Fascists"" are a deranged group, but the terms themselves are not derided lightly.

"
2486,2486,@USER How come they only asked 2 questions on gun control? That guy is in for sure,"This tweet does not contain any personal attack or offensive slur. 
It does contain a derisive term, but it is used in the context of a broader discussion about gun laws. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter API, there is no way to determine the gender of users.  So, it's hard to say if the person who wrote this is male or female.

"
2487,2487,@USER @USER Sounds to like the FISA court may have a problem too!. :United_States: MAGA :United_States: :United_States: KAG :United_States: :United_States: BUILD the WALL :United_States: ,"There is agreement with a statement made in the preceding tweet. 
  The FISCAL COURT may also have an issue with their surveillance of the Trump campaign.

"
2488,2488,@USER He has no social graces. That is why he was shunned by NY proper everyone knows he's white trash with a little money. He does not know how to act and makes everything about him. Always. He is just a Me ME Me POS that is an embarrassment to the USA.,"While the first half of the sentence is not offensive, there is a slur in the second half. 
  
  The word ""white trash"" is derisive and offensive to people of color. 
""Me ME ME"" can also be offensive because it is used to describe a person who is annoying or unlikable.

"
2489,2489,@USER @USER you are so funny,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and slurring, but it is not directed at a single individual. 
It is a lighthearted remark about someone's appearance. 
  The tone of the remark is friendly, so it would not be considered harassment.

"
2490,2490,Tyranny Totalitarianism Leftism JUST WHEN YOU THINK THELEFT CAN'T SINK ANY LOWER - Liberals fear their major cultural victories of the past half-century are democratically... URL,"This tweet contains no offensive slur or term, but it also does little to explain what the left fears. 
  The left has historically opposed many cultural achievements of democracy, such as civil rights, women's rights and gay rights. However, these achievements have been achieved through democratic processes, where the people have had a say in the matter. By contrast, liberals fear that cultural changes achieved by democratic means are threatened by tyrannical, totalitarian and leftist forces. This is a fear based on a lack of understanding of how these cultural shifts have come about.

"
2491,2491,@USER Thanks for Following. We're glad to be connected.,"This tweet contains no explicit language that is offensive or harassing. 
It is a straightforward acknowledgment of another user's comment. 
"
2492,2492,@USER @USER That’s where your wrong. Only ruins conservatives. If it was a dem he would be considered for head of dnc,"Offensive language: Strong offensive words such as ""cunt"" and ""head of the dnco"" are used in the original tweet. 
  
Negative attitude: In addition to the offensive word choices, there is also a tone in which the author is negative towards conservatives and their beliefs.

"
2493,2493,@USER It just hit me the fact that Bey is always on her private yacht whenever she is on vacay. Sis will stay on the water where non of y’all can bother her :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :face_with_tears_of_joy: ,"This tweet does contain profane language and is targeted towards a group of people. However, it is a general statement about vacationing and does  not contain personal insults or references to any one person. 
  
  This is an example of an offensive tweet:

@USER Beyoncé is the queen of yachts. She has a private island in the Bahamas, a helicopter, private jet, yacht, helicopter and a fleet of cars. When she's not touring the world she can be found on one of her many yacht.

"
2494,2494,...it will be hard to believe any female accusers...ever again...especially liberals who lie for personal and political gain... URL,"While the term ""lying liberal"" is offensive, there is no evidence to suggest that the user who was discussed in the original tweet is a liberal. In addition, ""liberal"" can also be used to refer to someone who is not a conservative or a Republican. Therefore, this tweet could be interpreted as a personal attack on a user based solely on her political affiliation.

"
2495,2495,@USER just saw your algae commercial blaming @USER that’s pretty rich considering you are the Gov and have done zero zip and now you want to be Senator of FL.,"This tweet criticizes a commercial that aired on TV criticizing the governor of Florida. While the commercial was critical of Governor Scott, Florida, President of Scott's campaign, Supervisor of his campaign and Scott’S staff, none of these individuals are Florida residents. Therefore, Scott is not a target of this criticism. 
  
Additionally, this tweet uses derrogatory language towards Governor Rick Scott. RickScott is a well known politician in Florida and has held many positions in government. It is therefore not appropriate to use derogyatory words to refer to him.

"
2496,2496,"""@USER @USER The term negative knowledge"""" strikes me, when knowledge is sucked away and information goes into reverse -- away from the recipient.""""""","While the use ""fucken"" in this context may not be appropriate, it is certainly not hate speech. 
  The word ""reverse"" is also not offensive. In this case, ""negative knowledge"" may have been offensive, if the author was referring to the process of taking knowledge and giving it to someone in reverse, as if it were a negative emotion.

"
2497,2497,@USER @USER Dude go away ....tin hatters like you make us conservatives look bad .....get a job,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and slur, but they are used in a derisive manner. The slang term ""tin-hatters"" is used to refer to people who are conservative, a term that can be offensive to some people. However, this term is not used with any negative connotation, nor is it used against any particular group of people based their gender or race. 
  
  The term ""@USER"" in this tweet refers to a specific person, @jessicamccarthy. This person is mentioned in relation to offensive slights and derision. While the term @user is often used as a sloppy substitute for username, in that case it was used ironically. In this case, however, ""@user"" was not meant to reference a username. Rather, ""@user @ user @ USER"" refers directly to @JessicaMccarty, making it clear that the deriding was specifically directed at that person.

"
2498,2498,@USER I think Jack is busy right now pushing the feds for their share of the $100-million museum project. Waiting for Liberals to suggest only they can deliver federal dollars.,"While the Tweet does contain derisive terms targeting the Liberal party, such terms are not the primary focus of this TWEET. Rather, this is an expression of optimism that the young athletes' future success will be a positive for the Canadian hockey community.

"
2499,2499,@USER The fact that she is disrespectful and blatantly rude has nothing to do with her situation :zany_face: ,"There is strong, but not offensive, language in this tweet. 
It seems the author is responding to another tweet that is using harmful language. 
"
2500,2500,@USER @USER Take a moment to realize Jimin is 22 and she is 39 years old. 17 year age difference. Breathe that in.,"A:

I believe the label for this tweet would be offensive.  The language used is derisive and demeaning. 
  ""They are"" is used to demote the group. ""They"" are not a person, but a collective.   
  Additionally, ""they"" can also be used as an object, so the demeanor of the speaker is implied.

"
2501,2501,@USER he is literally the best i cannot believe how poorly his previous owner treated him,"While the subject matter of the Tweet is negative, there is no explicit language that is offensive or derisive. 
There is a clear distinction between the opinions expressed in the text and any personal attack. 
  The opinions are based on facts and do not target individuals or groups.

"
2502,2502,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER It was surprising how fast Reagan passed gun control in Cali when the Black Panthers armed themselves.,"This tweet does contain derisive language and slang, but it's not directed at a person or group of people. Rather, this is an example of slangs and derision used in a humorous manner. 
  
  The deriding language is used to describe a political figure or party, rather than a specific person. Additionally, although the slanguage is derrogatory, there is no explicit reference to a race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, age, political affiliation, etc. Therefore, based on these factors, we classify this tweet as being non derisorory.

"
2503,2503,@USER He is vile.,"This tweet contains a derisive term for a group of people, namely ""vile"". 
  The term is derrogatory and is used to describe a person or a thing in an
  offended or negative way, often in jest. 
   
""Vile"" is a common slang term used in the United Kingdom to refer to a
person who is unpleasant or unlikable. While it can be used as an insult,
it is not necessarily negative or intended to cause offense.

"
2504,2504,@USER From a man (fast and furious) was held in contempt,"This tweet contains a negative comment about an individual based on their political views. This is an example of non offensive political discourse. 
  
  The individual being commented on is neither a part nor a leader of any political group. They do not endorse or promote any specific political ideology. Their views are not considered hateful or discriminatory.

"
2505,2505,@USER Williams showed that she is a bad sport. Male / Female no matter. Bad Sport and rude to the young woman who won.,"A:

I think the reason is that the word ""Republican"" is not offensive.  It is an accepted political party in America. 
 ""Offensive"" would be if the person using the term was making a derisive reference to that party.   
""Offensiveness""

"
2506,2506,@USER A positive note!,"Offensive language: ""Antifas"" is an offensive term. 
Negative sentiment: There does not appear to  be any negativity in this tweet. 
  The user seems genuinely interested in sharing a meal with another person.

"
2507,2507,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER He has been attending meetings regularly so maybe we should consider her for Polit Bureau :raised_fist_dark_skin_tone: :ear_of_corn: :raised_fist_dark_skin_tone: URL,"While the expletive used in the last tweet may not be appropriate for all audiences, in this case it was used to highlight a point about Jackie. The exclamatory nature of the word ""nuts"" is a positive aspect, and the use of slurring terms to describe someone is not acceptable.

"
2508,2508,@USER Disgusting. This is just more proof that property and home ownership is a MYTH...if you don't pay the taxes (RENT) you are thrown off YOUR LAND...you need PERMISSION to build on YOUR LAND.,"This tweet contains derisive language and slurring terms that are offensive and not suitable for a public conversation. 
  
""Disgusted"" is deriding and offensive, as is ""property"" and ""myth"". 
   
Additionally, this tweet targets a specific group of people, namely those who do not pay taxes. Taxes are a necessary cost of doing business in Canada, so it's not fair to criticize Canadians for not owning their own homes or paying taxes when others in our country are not held accountable for their actions.

"
2509,2509,@USER @USER @USER Oh...July...so like 35 &amp; 3/4 years ago... NO...that's a difference maker. I had no idea! Please share your thoughts on serial woman abuser &amp; Antifa lover @USER :thinking_face: ,"While the use of ""Antifa"" is offensive, this is an opinion and not a direct attack on any person or organization. 
""Serial woman abuse"" and ""Lover of Antifas"" are not slurring terms. 
   

A:
According to the Twitter's TOS, you can't use slang or profanity in user names. So, @user can only use a username that is not offensive.

"
2510,2510,qanon LIBERALS ARE LIKE MONKEYS THROWING THEIR OWN SHIT AT EVERYTHING,"This tweet contains no direct or indirect offensive words or phrases. It is an opinion expressed in a conversational tone. 
  
  The author is clearly expressing a strong dislike for the political party of a person or persons, however, it does so without targeting any individuals or groups.

"
2511,2511,@USER You are too cute &amp; adorable to handle....... Such a cutie....... How can I let you go Lobe you my love 4ever. ....... URL,"This tweet contains no offensive or derisive language. 
It is simply expressing a preference for a person. 
  The use the word ""URL"" is an example of a slang term used by the internet.

"
2512,2512,@USER You're a piece of shit for saying that FEMA was successful in helping Puerto Rico after hurricane Maria. 3000 people died. You think that's successful? You really have no soul. You're a fucking horrible human being. I don't even think you're human. FUCK YOU!!!,"Antifas are a hate group. They are known for their violent protests and use
of Nazi imagery. 
  
In the context of the Tweet, ""piece of sh*t"" is an offensive slur used to
criticize someone's character. It is not used in a positive way. 
""You're"" used as an adjective to describe someone as ""a piece
(of) sh-t"". This is offensive because it implies that someone is
unworthy of respect. ""You"" does not use an explicit slang word, but it
is still offensive as it suggests that the person being addressed is less
than human and does nothing to justify the use or interpretation of
offensiveness.

"
2513,2513,@USER Has this tweet been deleted?,"This tweet contained derisive language, such as the use of ""faggot"" and ""retard."" Derisiveness is not considered offensive in Twitter, so the label was not predicted. However, offensive or discriminatory language is forbidden, including the terms ""bitch,"" ""slut,"" and other derrogatory terms. Therefore, this label also was predicted as offensive.

"
2514,2514,@USER @USER Come on! Even 35 years later and don't remember any actual details of the event? this is nothing but another liberal doing whatever it takes to stop a conservative. The real SHAME here is seeing what liberals will do to get their way. U should be the one that should feel ashamed,"This tweet contains no derrogatory or explicit language. 
It does express concern over a specific user, but does so in an attempt to make light of it. 
  

Overall, this tweet did not violate the Twitter Rules.

"
2515,2515,@USER Yeah ... as if when a lady stranger randomly walks into your home the first thing you think to do is obey her verbal commands.... Sounds like she is trying to blame HIM for his own murder. Unbelievable.,"In the context of the conversation, it is an expression of a personal opinion. 
  The user is stating that conservatives and twitter do not seem to go together well, in a similar way that oxy-morphine doesnot go with prescription drugs. This is not a derisive or pejorative statement, but rather a statement of fact.

"
2516,2516,@USER After listening to your well thought out arguments on gun control I would like to respond to your key points with my counter argument. I DON'T LIKE YOUR GASSES.,"While the Tweet does contain offensive terms and language, there is no evidence that the user is targeting anyone in particular. In addition, while the language is derisive, offensive, or negative towards the target, in this case Twitter, none of these terms are used. Rather, this TWEET is a counter-argument to the points made by the Twitter user. Therefore, based on this information, we classify this as a non offensive Tweets.

"
2517,2517,@USER @USER Conservatives are notoriously gullible. I use wanted to make sure you knew.,"Conservatives are notorious for being gulled by false promises. In this tweet I wanted the author to know that I am a conservative and use the phrase 'gullibility of conservatives' in my profile bio.

"
2518,2518,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER She is. I dont think politics is for her to dabble in.,"In the context of this example, URL is a username that was not included in the original tweet. In this case, she is URL. Based on this information, we can see that URL does, in fact, dabbling in politics. This is an example of a non offensive use of URL in a tweet that mentions politics, as URL was included as part of an explanation.

"
2519,2519,@USER What would happen if she were to support gun control? Would the NRA help her opponent?,"This tweet contains a hypothetical scenario that is based on facts and is not intended to be offensive. 
In the scenario, Antifia supports gun controls, but the opposing candidate does the opposite. Antigua's NRA would likely support the candidate who opposes Antiflua.

"
2520,2520,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Thanks in advance for the follow back,"This tweet does contain offensive terms such as ""arms"", ""gun"", and ""control"". However the terms are used in an argumentative way, rather than being slurring or using offensive words to denigrate a group of people or a religion. The author is presenting an opinion on a topic and asking for feedback. This is a common practice in online discussions and does NOT constitute offensive speech.

"
2521,2521,@USER THIS IS A NO BRAINER. IF SHE STANDS FOR WHAT SHE SAYS SHE DOES SHE HAS TO VOTE AGAINST HIM IF SHE IS LYING SHE DESERVES TO BE HUMILIATED AND DEFEATED. WE WILL SEE IF SHE PLAYED THE PRO CHOICE CAED TO GET ELECTED OR IF SHE IS JUST ANOTHER GOPER KOCHSUCKER,"This tweet does contain derrogatory and offensive terms such as ""liar,"" ""coward,"" and ""traitor.""

While derisive terms are considered offensive, they are not the main focus of the Tweet. Instead, it focuses on addressing another user who was disagreeing with the derisor. 
  
  The derision is used to emphasize a point that is being made. In this case, that a person who is lying should be humiliated and defeated.

"
2522,2522,"""conservatives everywhere in my small red town, kids need to be spanked and put God first. They need to know consequences!"""". Also them, """"BrettKavanuagh shouldn't be held responsible for something he did at 17!! Hypocrites @USER how do sleep at night?""""""","Both tweets contain derisive language, but the second tweet uses the word ""sleep"" to express the speaker's point, and the derision is aimed at the conservative politicians. 
  
  The first tweet contains derrogatory and offensive language towards a person, however the language is used in a humorus context.

"
2523,2523,@USER @USER @USER Oh you just wait til you see the next hurricane meal I tweet out! You are gonna be sooo jealous...,"This tweet contains a mild insult, ""hurricane,"" which is generally considered offensive. However, in this context it could also be considered a playful tease or a joke. 
  
In addition, although the rest of the sentence is unrelated to the insult or joke, some of its content could still be offensive, such as ""you are,"" ""this game,"" and ""sooo."" 
   
Finally, this tweet was sent to another Twitter user, so it may be difficult to determine the author's actual opinion.

"
2524,2524,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Keep lying bud no one is listening,"In the first tweet the author expresses a non offensive opinion, however the opinion is not based on facts and is therefore considered not worthy of a response. 
Secondly, in the second tweet it appears the the writer is making a negative statement about a person based solely on their emoji usage. In this case the statement is offensive as the negative attitude towards another person is based purely on emoticons. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, if a tweet contains ""offensiveness"", the company will not allow the account to post tweets for 24 hours.

"
2525,2525,@USER you really should consider having the Conservatives go knocking on doors to talk to people. Quebec has been asking for Conservative presence because they're not well known there. Send them out. Make Conservatives known there.,"While the sentiment of the Tweet is positive, there is nothing in it that is explicitly offensive or targeted at any individual in particular. 
Quebec has asked for conservative presence in their province. Sending the Conservative party out to knock on Quebecers' doors would be an effective way to make them known to them. 
"
2526,2526,@USER @USER @USER He is an incredible leader and a true hero. Thank you Chef. @USER,"While the Tweet does contain derrogatory language and offensive terms (e.g. ""hero""), it does so in the context of a conversation between friends. In addition, it is not directed at any specific person or organization. Therefore, this factor does NOT classify the content as offensive.

"
2527,2527,@USER pay close attention he is the same guy that warned us that 45 was a con man,"This tweet contains no offensive terms or language. 
It is not focused solely on criticizing the person or entity mentioned in the original tweet. 
  The message is supportive and encouraging.

"
2528,2528,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Ummm theres video of it and the coach literally admitted to it lmao. Maybe read before having strong shitty opinions,"@USER is an account that is likely a bot. Bot accounts often use this pattern of ""@USER name"" to impersonate real people. 
""Loool"" is slang for ""lol"" which means ""wow"" or ""cool."" It is not considered offensive to use in a tweet but could be considered rude or out of place in some contexts. 
  

A:
According to the Twitter Rules, account suspension is for violations of their Terms of Service: https://twitter.com/rules/status/1022356720676539104
Suspension is also for harassment, threats, spam, hateful conduct, pornography, self-promotion, impERSONATION of another user, fraud, phishing, abuse of a disabled account, copyright or trademark infringement, etc.

"
2529,2529,@USER @USER The Brandon Lewis express URL,"While the language used in this tweet is offensive, there is not enough context to determine whether it is directed at a specific person or is a general slur. Additionally, this is an example of how offensive slang can cause a tweet to appear nonoffensice.

"
2530,2530,@USER Wtf have I missed here. My account was hacked and just got it back up and running. Somebody care to explain what’s going on here. Am I right in saying that the guy who has been playing live saying he is Dash Berlin aka Jeff ??? So what’s happened ???,"This tweet contains a username, but the username is not the user's actual username. This is because Twitter does allow users to change their username at any time, and it is possible that this username was changed by this user at some point in the past. In this case, Twitter would not be able to tell that you are replying to this Tweet, so it would classify this as your first Tweets as that username and not as offensive. 
  
In this particular case the name ""Dash Berlin"" is a pseudonym used by many people, including the musician Dash Snow. Therefore, even if the person who was playing the live ""Berlin"" was indeed the famous musician "" Dash "" Berlin, that does NOT mean that he was repressing this person. He could have been repelling any random person, for any reason. So in this specific case Twitter classified this non offensive, because it was not clear that it targeted a single person or a group of people based on their opinion.

"
2531,2531,@USER Aye nigga :eyes: ,"@USER is a username used by the Twitter API. 
nigga is an offensive slang term for the word ""boy."" 
  The word is slurred in this instance, as if the speaker were under the influence of drugs or alcohol. 
   The slurring is meant to convey the idea that the person being referred to is sub-human, a stereotype of African-Americans.

"
2532,2532,@USER @USER These liberals have no problem lying.,"Offensive language includes words like 'lying', 'fuck', and 'cunt'.
Negative sentiment includes statements like, 'Liberals have lied', or 'They lie all the time'. 
  
Non-threatening language uses inclusive words and phrases like:  'fat belly', 'suggesting fasting',   'insulin resistance', etc. 
"
2533,2533,@USER Finally a administration that cares about its legal citizens,"This tweet contains no explicit slur, offensive term, racial slang, etc. The term “legal citizens” is not derisive or used in an offensive way, and it is a neutral term that does describe a legal status. 
  
  The author of the Tweet is an elected official, so it's possible that the author's beliefs may have influenced their classification. However, this is purely speculation, as the Twitter API does hide who the user is.

"
2534,2534,@USER @USER Real conservatives are stepping up.,"This tweet does contain offensive terms and language. 
  The user uses the word ""faggot"" to describe a person who disagrees with them.  
  They also use the term ""retarded"" in a derisive way to refer to someone who is different from them, and they use ""pussy"" as a slur to insult a woman. 
These terms are considered offensive by many, including the company who classified this tweet.

"
2535,2535,@USER @USER @USER ...unless you are good with an accused rapist sitting on the highest bench in the land. I'm sure your female constituents would love to hear you explain that away...,"This tweet contains a term that is generally considered to have a negative connotation (i.e. ""rape"")
Although the term is used in a joking manner, its use in this context is likely to cause offense to many people. 
  The mention that the judge is ""accused rapists"" is particularly offensive, since this implies that a person is guilty until proven innocent.

"
2536,2536,@USER Look at this chill as fuck bearded dragon URL,"This tweet contains derisive names and nick names for the beaded lizard. 
It also uses offensive slang and language to refer to a person. 
  

A:
According to this tweet classification model, beardless lizards are chill.

"
2537,2537,@USER @USER What are these new ideas? Speech laws gun control killing babies and thinking your entitled to free healthcare and rich ppls money just bc you exis?,"Offensive language is strong language that is intended to offend or cause emotional distress. 
  The language used in the Tweet is offensive and could cause distress to others. ""Killing babies"" is a strong word to use to describe the effects of gun violence. Additionally, ""thinking your entitlement to healthcare"" could offends some people.  

A:
According to the Twitter's TOS, you are not allowed to threaten or attack someone personally. So, I would classify this as abusive language.

"
2538,2538,Good Job asshole!!!...You just killed your dad's chance of a get out of jail free card!!! MAGA @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER URL,"In the context of the conversation, @user is someone who is likely to be a high-level Democratic Party official or activist. The @username is not disclosed in the Tweet. 
@USER is the username of one of Hillary Clinton's top aides. 
  The @Username is Valarie Jarret, a senior advisor to President Obama and former advisor for President Clinton. Jarrette is also a co-chair of Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.

"
2539,2539,@USER @USER @USER Are you guys really still supporting the @USER party that suspended you all because you went into coalition with the @USER Deary me Talk about desperation to be noticed,"This tweet does contain derrogatory words, such as ""dear,"" ""pathetic,"" and ""desperation."" However, they are used in relation to a specific person, not as a derogy word in general. In addition, it's important to note that the word ""USER"" is also derogratory, so it could be argued that this word is being used as derograatory in this context. However the context of this tweet makes it clear that it was used derographically. 
In the first sentence of that tweet the author states ""Are you really supporting [the] @[USER] party?"" This implies that they do not support the ""party"" of supporting users, which is the party the suspended them. ""Supporting"" implies a positive sentiment, whereas ""supporting"" in that context implies ""not opposing.""

Ultimately, this is an extremely close call, as there is some derographic content, however the derographical content is clearly in service of criticizing a person and not in an offensive manner, therefore the classification of offensive is incorrect.

"
2540,2540,@USER @USER But refugees! Marijuana! Peoplekind! Gun control!,"@USER has used a slur to describe a group of people, which is offensive and not acceptable. 
  The slurs @user has mentioned are ""Peoplekind"" and ""Marijuana"". These slurred are derisive and have no place in society.

"
2541,2541,@USER @USER nigga thought it was gone a 44 point game??? funny to ya boy,"@USER: the username of a Twitter user
Nigga: a derisive term used to refer to a person of African descent
Thought it Was gone: an exaggeration to suggest that a basketball game was over
44 point Game: this is an exaggerated reference to the score of an NBA basketball basketballgame

According to this article, offensive terms are defined as: ""offensiveness is determined by the context, tone, content, speaker, time, place, audience, purpose, object, manner, knowledge, experience, education, training, expertise, affiliation, motivation, license, endorsement, sponsorship, payment, inducement, request, recommendation, suggestion, expectation, guarantee, assurance, promise, representation, warranty, assumption, reliance, opinion, belief, suspicion, allegation, gossip, innuendo, insinuation, surmise, conjecture, speculation, rumor, accusation, imputation, implication, presumption, inference, conclusion, assessment, evaluation, judgment, decision, determination, verdict, finding, declaration, report, statement, testimony, attribution, responsibility, fault, liability, blame, criminal act, civil liability.""
In your example, there is nothing offensive in it. However, it could be considered offensive if the following words are considered to be offensive: niggar, thought, gone, 44, point, game.

2542,2542,@USER and that was all done before I was 25 younger then this moron at 18 I was at Parris Island and at 25 I was at the New Jersey State Police Academy for a municipal class for 14 weeks she was tending bar at 25 and listening to all her drinking customers she is a joke,"This tweet contains a critical opinion of a public figure, and it contains no offensive slur or term. 
However, this opinion is based on facts that are disputed by the public figures in question. For example, in the original tweet the user states that Ivana Trump was ""given everything"" on ""a silver plate"" by then-President of United States, Donald Trump. This is disputed, as Ivankatrump has stated that she inherited her position and was not given it. Additionally, Ivanna Trump has also stated in an interview that her role at Trump Organization was a ""paycheck"" and not a position of power. 
  
In addition, although the Twitter user in this case is criticizing Ivane Trump for being dependent, she has not used derrogatory or negative language to describe her. Instead, her criticism is expressed in positive terms, such as ""cheap labor"" or ""disempowering"" women.

"
2543,2543,@USER Maybe we need more gun control after all - liberals should not be allowed to possess them!,"There is nothing offensive in this tweet; it is a joke. 
This tweet is not about Conservatives vs. Liberals, but about Twitter vs the general public. Twitter is an online social media platform where people can post messages, known as tweets. Tweets can contain text, links, emojis, and videos. On the other hand, Conservatives are a political party in Western democracies. They are opposed to liberalism, which is the dominant political ideology in most Western countries. So, in context, this joke is about a disagreement between Twitter and the political parties of Western democratic countries, namely the Liberals.

"
2544,2544,@USER WHAT i cant like HE IS LEGIT WATCHING my ever move In Rehab!!!,"While the content of the Tweet may have been offensive, there was no explicit language that would be considered offensive. ""Legit"" is a common slang term used by the rapper to describe his fan base, which is not considered derisive or offensive in and of itself. 
"
2545,2545,@USER {| That's okay!,"Offensive language includes explicit slurring of a racial, ethnic, religious, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, veteran status, and other categories of people. 
  
  Offensiveness can also be inferred from the use of derisive terms or phrases that are commonly associated with offensive slang. Offensive slangs include racial epithets, derogs, homophobic slants, etc.

"
2546,2546,@USER Bad behavior like that is never acceptable.,"This tweet does express positive affection and happiness towards a person's family member. 
  The use and description of loving emoji and nicknaming conveys affectionate pride and love.  
There is also no explicit derrogatory or abusive language in this Tweet. 
However, there is an underlying tone of disapproval towards liberals in general, and the use the word ""absolutely"" is meant to emphasize this disapprobation.

"
2547,2547,"""@USER @USER Just remember it took Mark Felt 30 years before he would admit he was Deep throat"""". These denials r meaningless""""""","This tweet contains a reference to an article about the history of Watergate, but the author of that article, Mark Lane, is not mentioned by name. It is possible that the reference is to another article by Lane that has not been identified. 
  
In any case, it is clear that Lane is a controversial figure who has made controversial statements. He has claimed that former President Richard Nixon ordered the Watergating break-in to spy on his political enemies, that he himself was a participant in the break in,  and that then-CIA Director William Colby covered up the truth about it. Lane has also claimed, without evidence, ""that the CIA has a long history, stretching back to its earliest days, of operating as a vast, covert intelligence organization whose function has always been to conduct espionage, sabotage, assassinations, propaganda, subversion, intelligence gathering, military intelligence, psychological operations, political intelligence and, in some cases, criminal operations for hire."" 
 The reference in this tweet is clearly intended to suggest that people should not take Lane's statements seriously. However, Lane himself has stated that his statements are based on fact, so it would be inaccurate to classify this as offensive.

"
2548,2548,science ecology health nature The Problem of the One and the Many in Gun Control URL URL,"While the first tweet contains a few offensive words, they are not used in context and are therefore not considered offensive. 
Although the second tweet uses offensive terms and language (e.g. ""One"" and ""Many""), it is still not offensive because it expresses an individual's opinion and does so in an offensive manner only in relation to a specific topic (i.e., gun control).

Note that the classification of any tweet depends on a combination of factors, including the language used, context, tone, who is saying it, how they say it and whether it contains explicit or implicit offensive content.

"
2549,2549,@USER @USER @USER If economy plummets post-Brexit then less money for public services; if less immigration to work on farms and services no doubt you will step in? Conservatives BrexitShambles 2/2,"This tweet does mention immigration and the Brexit vote, however, it does so in a humorous way and makes light of the situation. The author is clearly not advocating for or against either side of a political debate, they are simply expressing their opinion. 
  
Additionally, this tweet contains no derrogatory or offensive terms, so it is also classified in this category.

"
2550,2550,@USER Go away my child. You are so boring that you can't even entertain a doubt. :pile_of_poo: :pile_of_poo: :pig_face: :pig_face: ,"This tweet contains a derogatory term for a member of a minority group. 
  The term is used in a negative context and is not used to describe the
  member of that group in an offensive or derisive way.

"
2551,2551,@USER He's like Meuller Hunted by A Master Sportsman / and the most powerful man in the world / Barry armed Trump Unwittingly with Lethal Force / Barry Never thought Killary would lose / URL,"Barry is a well-known person, and ""unwillingly"" using lethal force against him is not considered to constitute an offensive statement. 
Killary is the former Secretary of State of Hillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 US presidential election to Donald Trump. 
  The use of a hunting term to refer to a person who is powerful is offensive.

"
2552,2552,@USER @USER Keep up the good work Jurky---you will have CA broke by the time you leave-just about there today.....yes I sold my property in Rancho Mirage ----limited hurt.....,"There is neither positive nor negative tone in the Tweet. The language is enthusiastic and positive, but not negative or harsh. 
It is an expression of expert opinion on a matter. Experts may have different opinions, so it does contain some degree of subjectivity. However, it also contains a positive tone, acknowledging that Jackie is doing a good job and is likely to succeed.

According to this article, malignant Narcissists are characterized by: 

 

They are often charismatic and charming, especially when they want to be. They can be very charming when talking to others, even when their behavior is aggressive or antagonistic. This is because they are very good at playing to an audience’s emotions, rather than just their intellect. Their charm can fool others into thinking they have good character, until they strike at their next victim. When they do strike, they can appear completely nonchalant about their actions, as if they were just another day at the office. But in reality, their charm is just a mask for their true, dark, manipulative nature.

2553,2553,@USER @USER @USER @USER He’s dead. So you are a necrophiliac as well? Good to know...you must suck at chess never mind 3 dimensional chess...you can’t even think one move ahead let alone many...Change your twitter handle to DumbAF not even ish :face_with_rolling_eyes: :face_with_rolling_eyes: :face_with_rolling_eyes: ,"In the first half of this Tweet, @user refers to the deceased person as ""he"". This is an offensive term as it is used to refer to a person of any gender as a ""she"" or ""him"". 
  
  In addition, in response to @User's request to stop crying,  @user says ""you"" instead of ""me"". @ user does this to indicate that they were the one who requested @ User to not make @ themcry. This implies that @ USer is the victim in this interaction, and that the @ death is a source of emotional pain for @ usr. 
   
Finally, after @usr says they can't think ""one move"" ahead, they say ""Change my twitter name to dumbaf"". The word ""dumbaf"" is offensive as this word is often used as an insult to describe someone who is slow-witted. @dumbfoundead is one famous example of someone using this insult.  This insult is also used in a derisive manner to insult someone for their lack of fashion sense.

"
2554,2554,"""@USER @USER @USER However if by at the top"""" you mean Senior Engineers generally, then you are *once again* confusing individual competence - which surprise surprise hasn't changed - with organisational structure and competence. Good people thrive in a structure that allows things to get done""""""","While the mention that ""Senior Engineers"" are ""at the tops"" is humerous, there is no explicit reference to any individual person or group. Instead, this is a general statement about the competence of engineers in general. This is not an offensive statement. 
""However if"" and ""however"" can be used to express uncertainty or doubt. In this case, they are used in the humorus way of expressing excitement. While this may not be considered offensive, some people may find it humorsome. 
 ""if by"" means ""in case"" or ""when"". So, ""by Senior"" could mean ""according to senior"" which is an idiom that can express doubt or uncertainty. So the statement could also be interpreted as ""However, if you consider senior engineers generally then..."" which could still be understood as a statement of doubt about generalising engineers into a group and not a reference of any specific person

A:
(Note: I am not affiliated with this company)
We analyzed the text of this tweet and classified it as not offensive.  The main point of contention is that the author is expressing doubt that John K. is qualified to speak on behalf of Antifas.   The author does mention his qualifications, but the context of his comments is more about his lack of qualifications than his actual qualifications.

"
2555,2555,@USER 4chan trolling Antifa again?,"Antifa is a political organization that is known for their opposition to racism, fascism, and other forms of oppression. The organization has received criticism for using violent tactics, including the use of weapons. 
  
In the context of the Antifas tweet above, Antfas is likely referring to the online forum 4Chan, where the original tweet originated. 4Channers are known to troll political organizations and individuals, often using offensive and derrogatory language. AntFas likely is referring here to a group of 4channers known as the /AnTIFA, a reference to an earlier iteration of Antfa.

"
2556,2556,@USER @USER Let us all return to bouncer school.,"This tweet contains a reference to a popular TV series, Bouncers. Boulé is French for ""bouncy castle"", a type of amusement park ride. In the TV Series, a boulÉ is an institution that provides services to the community, such as security and entertainment. 
  The bOUné school is where the bougie learn how to do their job.

"
2557,2557,12 : mysterious and I still think you are: face_with_tears_of_joy:,"This tweet contains no explicit language that is offensive or violates the Twitter Rules. However, it does express a view that some people find offensive. 
  
  The use the emojis face with tears of joy is likely to be interpreted as a joke. This is because emoticons are often used to represent nonverbal cues, such as laughter or joy. In addition, emoticon faces are typically displayed with their eyes closed, making them look like they are laughing.

"
2558,2558,@USER @USER omg yeah the thing is that there can be a large range of price for the same item i once bought a bag for RM20+ but i also saw another shop selling it for RM60+ like wow,"In the example tweet above, @user is clearly not happy with the bag price. They are clearly unhappy with this specific shop for selling the item at a higher price, but the price difference is not considered to constitute offensive or abusive language in the Tweet. 
  
However, if @User is unhappy about the prices of other items, then that could constitute abusive or offensive behaviour. In that case, we would classify the above Tweets as abusive.

"
2559,2559,@USER we are done debating. we win debates all the time and you liberals win by doing what you want in govt and elsewhere. We are going to defeat you in every way you defeated us now. Be prepared.,"While the use of strong language in the first tweet may be considered offensive by some, in context, this is an expression of the frustration that many people feel towards liberals for their control of society and the world. 
  
  The second tweet does contain derisive language towards a group of people, however, there is not enough context to determine whether this language is targeted at a particular individual. Furthermore, while the third tweet uses strong words, they are not slurring any individuals.

"
2560,2560,Just watching a Horizon show about scientists that discovered a DNA mix between humans and Neanderthals.Would have thought Trump getting elected would have been proof enough. MAGA,"While the content of the Tweet is not offensive, there is slang and profanity that could be considered offensive. The Tweeter is expressing their opinion on a TV show, which could imply that the slangs used in their TWEET are part of their slanguage. 
Also, while the opinion expressed in this TWTweet may be held by many, some people may find it offensive and discriminatory. For example, a person of color might find the use of ""Neanderthal"" offensive because it is considered a slur against people of African descent.

"
2561,2561,@USER @USER Rescue conservatives from its own demons? Who are the two or three most notorious serial abusers of women in the last 30 years? Hint: they were not GOP. Did they ever face consequences?,"In the context of the conversation, @user is the person who made the offensive comment. 
@USER is an account that the Twitter user follows. 
  The offensive tweet was made by @USER.  
  Based upon the information provided, this tweet appears to target a specific person or people.   

If the prediction is correct, then the targeted person(s) are being called out in a derisive manner. This is offensive and should be taken down.

"
2562,2562,@USER Any time liberals think their going to get a win they tune into their head cheerleader. Then they realize the latest bombshell is once again nothing and go back to their miserable existence eating chunky monkey (not racist) and watching Netflix,"This tweet contains an explicit insult, threat, and derogy of language: ""liberals"" and ""head cheerleaders"".

A:
According to the Twitter's TOS, users can't make threats or insults against groups of users. So, it's not possible to classify this as non offensive tweet.

"
2563,2563,@USER @USER Just block the idiot. He's not even worth this post.,"Offensive language: ""idiot"" is a derisive term used to refer to someone who is not as smart or talented as another person. 
  ""Gun control"" and ""Machine GunKelly"" are offensive terms used in reference to people who own or use guns.  

Non-Offense: There was no personal attack, offensive content or derrogatory content.

"
2564,2564,@USER The really frightening thing is that plenty of Antifa are stupid enough to believe this is true. I'd put a bet on the first one to try it being a woman Antifa. They seem to be the most stupid and more willing to vitue signal their way into an early grave.,"Antifa is an anti-fascist organization that stands for Anti-Fascism in German. Antifascists are opposed to far-right groups and are often associated with left-wing causes. 
In the context of the above tweet the word ""Antifas"" is derisive and is used to describe Antigovernment activists, who are associated more with the right-leaning political ideology. 
  
""Antigravity"" refers to a hypothetical form of propulsion that would allow objects to travel at near-the-speed-of-light speeds without the use of fuel or other propellants. This is often used as a derision for the UFO community, as they are not believed to use fuel and instead are propelled via unknown forces.

"
2565,2565,@USER @USER @USER How convenient a conservative dummy believes people are selectively unemployed.Conservatives always try to use this type of propaganda. No facts!Just their warped conservative beliefs. It’s very clear.Many conservatives like @USER don’t have the ability to learn or think,"Conspiracy theories are often considered offensive, as they are false claims made to explain away something that is unclear or beyond the scope of understanding. In this case, @user believes that many conservatives do not have ""the ability"" to understand or learn, which is an insult to those who do have this ability.

"
2566,2566,@USER Billy bargain :thumbs_up: ,"Billy is an offensive term used to refer to a person of mixed race. 
  The term is derisive and is used as a slur. 
@USER is someone who has retweeted the original tweet and has asked to explain their reasoning.

"
2567,2567,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Except you kind of are when it comes to gun control,"This tweet contains a reference to an earlier tweet that contained offensive content, and the reference is not immediately apparent without reading the earlier message. The earlier statement is about a user named ""Jack,"" and it does contain offensive terms and language. However, it also does so in the context of a broader discussion about gun laws and policy, so it can be considered generally nonoffensiveness. 
  
In addition, this tweet does mention a specific individual, ""Tina,"" who is referenced in both the original and earlier messages. While the message does seem to contain a harmless reminder, its tone is also somewhat derisive, making it offensive.

"
2568,2568,@USER Does anyone proof read these articles before you post them? The article states 'the victim is in hospital in a critical condition where she remains'. Probably best she does as the headline tells us that she is dead!!! Sack the 12yo work experience kid who put this together.,"This tweet contains a factual error, where the author has incorrectly stated that a person is ""in hospital a  critical condition"" when in fact they are in ""hospital in  a  critial condition.""

A:
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, critical is defined as: ""3. adj. 1. of or relating to criticism or criticism: as, a criticism of a critic.""  So the sentence is incorrect.  The correct sentence would be ""the  victim is  in  hospital  with  serious  injuries  where  she  remains.""

"
2569,2569,@USER @USER Yes it does. She should be made to resign. MAGA,"In this tweet the term ""MAGA"" is used as a pejorative term to refer to the
  American flag. The term is considered to have a racial connotation and
is considered highly offensive. 
  
However, in this context, there is nothing in
the tweet that would be deemed offensive or
racist. It's a simple suggestion to buy more
ice cream. In this case, ""buy more ICE cream""
would be an acceptable suggestion, even if it
were to use the word ""ICE"" instead of "" MAG A"".

A:
According to this article, Twitter has a ""hateful conduct"" policy.  It's not clear if that policy is enforced, but if you are concerned that your tweets may violate the policy, you can report them to Twitter.

"
2570,2570,@USER @USER @USER You’re the embarrassment who should be kicked out of the @USER,"This tweet uses offensive slurs to describe the user. 
  
Offensive slur: ""Chink"" is defined as ""a person of Chinese descent who is perceived as being subservient to a dominant white person"" (Wikipedia). 
   
""Chinks"" was used by the Nazis to refer to people of Asian descent during World War II. This slurred term is still used today to denigrate people who are perceived to be of East Asian or Asian-American descent.  The use in this context is highly offensive.

"
2571,2571,@USER I thought they turned into Antifa?,"This tweet contains no deroganatory or offensive terms. 
It is an expression of excitement about the hypothetical possibility that a group called Antifas might take over the NYT.

"
2572,2572,"""@USER @USER I think this is more a way to scare Brexiteer Conservatives into toeing the party line. Brexiteers are all for the will of the people"""" so long as the people agree with them.""""""","""Brexiter"" is a derisive term used by members of UK's Conservative party to refer to someone who supports Brexit, a decision by Parliament to leave the European Union. 
  
  The term ""Brexit"" refers to a similar political decision made by UK Parliament. ""Will of  the  people"" in this context refers  to the decision to exit the EU, which was made in a referendum held in June 2016.  Conservatives are generally in favour of this decision. 
In the Tweet, ""@user"" appears as a username. This is an assumed username based on who the author believes the Twitter user to  be. In this case, ""@USER""  appears to represent the username of ""Tweeter,"" a person who is known to use the term ""@user."" 
   
   The Tweeting user appears  not to have intended to offend anyone with this tweet. However,  it is possible that the  TWEET could be seen as offensive by some people.

"
2573,2573,@USER I think we should be going after Sen Feinstein if she really cared she would not have sat on this issue and made it political. She is using you like all democratic power seekers be careful who you sell your soul too,"While the use and description of emoticons may not be appropriate for all users, it is possible that the author was trying to make a point about how the media manipulates people's emotions and how people should not let themselves be swayed by the news. 
  
  The use or description  of profane words may offend some users. However, this does  not make the entire tweet offensive. While the profanities used in the text may have been considered inappropriate by many, they were not used to offensively target or insult anyone.

"
2574,2574,@USER Cuz it’s the truth...and they don’t like that one bit. Doesn’t fit their agenda MAGA,"Offensive language: the word ""cunt"" is used in the original tweet. While it may be a slang term used by some users, it can be offensive to others. 
  
Derogative remarks: there are no derrogatory or negative remarks in this tweet towards anyone.

"
2575,2575,@USER you are the only motherfucker with common sense on this website,"This tweet contains no explicit slur or offensive term. 
However, some people might find the use of the word ""motherfuck"" to be offensive. 
  This is because ""Motherfucking"" is a slang term used by African-American males to refer to another African American male. This term is considered derisive and offensive to many people.

"
2576,2576,@USER And the most insignificant comment comes from a Miss America contestant.,"There is a mention of a gun in this tweet. However, there is nothing in that tweet that would make it offensive. 
  
  The mention is in a humorous context. Eliminating the mention would not change the meaning of the rest of this Tweet.

"
2577,2577,@USER @USER Kirk Douglas you are not.,"@USER is a user who commented on this answer. 
Kirk Douglas is not a real person. 
  The comment is just a reference to a famous actor.

"
2578,2578,@USER Holder is worse than John Gotti or Al Capone. Why? Because neither of them held themselves out as honest law abiding citizens. The only Attorney General in our Nations history that was censored by our Congress.,"This tweet contains a derisive reference to the former Attorney-General of the United States, Eric Holder. Holder was the first African American to serve as the top law enforcement officer in the country. He was also the subject of a number of controversial leaks by a former employee, and was eventually forced to resign from office. 
  
While the derision in this particular tweet may be targeted at Holder's race or ethnicity, it is not directed at him personally. Rather, he is being referred to as a ""law-abiding citizen"" who is ""censor[ed]"" by Congress. While this is a negative comment about Holder, there is no explicit reference in that tweet to him using dishonest means to accomplish a goal. Therefore, we classify this as not being offensive.

"
2579,2579,@USER hmm i'd do something like getting really high quality artists to draw really boring cars like a fucking 2002 grand prix or something,"In the first tweet the word ""Lying"" is used in reference to a statement made by the Twitter user. In the second tweet a derisive term is suggested to someone who buys an anti-fascist shirt. The third tweet suggests that the purchase of an Anti-Fascista shirt is a joke. All of these are considered offensive and are not suitable for social media.

"
2580,2580,@USER Wow Antifa turning on her too?,"Antifa is a far-left extremist group that has committed acts of violence and property destruction. Their violent actions have been condemned by many in the political spectrum. Antifas are not considered offensive in this context. 
  
Ivanka Trump is an American businesswoman and former advisor to President Donald Trump. Her father is the current president of America and she is widely considered one the most powerful women globally.  She has advocated for women's empowerment and has spoken out against labor abuses and discrimination. Some have criticized her for her business decisions and for being dependent upon her family for financial support. These criticisms have also been considered derisive and offensive.

"
2581,2581,@USER @USER Yes we did,"While the use of the word ""dick"" in this context might not be appropriate, there is no explicit personal attack or offensive slur in it. The word is used in a derisive manner, but not in an explicit way to insult or target a particular person. 
  
  The tone of this tweet could be seen as somewhat joking, expressing the desire for a different channel to air sports. However, this is still an expression of a preference, not an attack on any person in particular.

"
2582,2582,@USER Don't you have to have some proof? :thinking_face: ,"While the statement may seem offensive, there is no explicit language or slur targeting any group or individual. In fact, @user is a username that the person using the account frequently uses, so it is likely that they are a member of the group being discussed in the original tweet. 
  
Additionally, while the sentiment of this statement is offensive to many, this is an expression of personal opinion, and not a direct attack on any person or groups.

"
2583,2583,@USER @USER BOOP POLICE DEPARTMENT FREEZE OH SHIT SHE IS TOO CUTE OPEN BOOPBOOPBOOP URL,"While the language in the Tweet is negative, there are no slur words, derrogatory comments, racial epithets, etc. that would be considered offensive. 
  
  The Tweeter is praising a person they are following, so there's no explicit call to violence.

"
2584,2584,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER California needs this man in the worst way. The liberals have almost destroyed that state.,"This tweet contains no explicit slur, offensive term, personal attack, nor does it express an offensive opinion. 
It is supportive of a person who has lost a loved one, which is a common sentiment expressed in many tweets. 
  The person mentioned in this tweet was a state senator, so it may be a reference to their political beliefs. However, it does contain no slang or derisive terms to describe the state of California.

"
2585,2585,@USER But not as despicable as her own.,"It is a humerous remark that is not meant to be taken seriously. 
While the comment is made about the Democratic Party, it could be understood as an offensive remark about any political party. 
  

A:
According to this tweet by John M. Mcenroe, he is over 60 years old.  Based upon the information provided, this is an accurate statement and is therefore not offensive.

"
2586,2586,@USER @USER Hahaha...It didnt happen so she is fine.....,"@USER is an account that is part of a parody Twitter account called Q anon. The account @Qanon is meant to parodies Twitter accounts like Q, A, V, S, M, etc. 
  
  The account Qanon uses a URL shortener called Maga URL to generate URLs that contain the username of Q or A or V or S or M or other users. For example, @KENNEDYQ is shortened to @kennedyq.

  @KENNYJFKJR is the account of J.F. Kennedy Jr. and is not offensive. However, some users believe that the name JF Kennedy is offensive and the Twitter user @kennedysnowflake has called for the shortening of @JFKennedyJfk to avoid the acronym.  

 @User is another account on QAnon and it uses the word ""Nope"" to indicate that a statement is unlikely to happen. @Kennedylol is one of their tweets that uses this word. In this tweet they are wishing that @shanatovah, a social justice activist group, will be watching the live stream of Temple mount in jerusalem 24/7. Some users consider this offensive as they believe it implies that Shana Tova is something bad. Shanna Tov is actually a Hebrew word for ""good year"".

"
2587,2587,@USER I can't :loudly_crying_face: :loudly_crying_face: he is already 26,"This tweet does express a negative opinion towards someone based on their age. However, it does so in a friendly and casual manner, and does include derrogatory words and slang. 
  
  The language is not intended to be offensive, but rather to express an age-related opinion. This is common on Twitter, where people express their opinions on topics such as fashion, music, movies, etc. based off of their own age and experiences.

"
2588,2588,@USER A better decision by the students would be to go to a community college at a fraction of the cost and actually learn something worthwhile.... over priced courses like this are an absolute waste of money...how many articles have been written lately on amount of student debt?,"While the tone of this tweet may be critical and negative, there is nothing in it that is offensive. In fact, this is an example of a user expressing their opinion on a topic, and asking for a different perspective. This is not an attack on any person or group, but rather a request for information. 
  

A:
According to this article, ""offensiveness"" is determined by a combination of factors, including the number of people offended, whether the offensive material is directed at an individual, how offensive the material actually is, etc.  In this case, I think the factors that tipped the scales in favor of ""non- offensive"" were the lack of personal attack, that the content was not particularly offensive,  and that it was a general request to hear other perspectives.

"
2589,2589,@USER Please call the vote. We conservatives also vote in November.,"Victoria is an offensive name, so the use the word ""conservatives"" is also offensive. 
  The use ""November"" refers to a month, but the month of November is not associated with voting. Therefore, using ""vote"" in the context of Victoria's tweet would be considered offensive, as it is likely to evoke negative associations with the election process.

"
2590,2590,@USER 3) this appointment has been commonly know for 6 months minimum .But now when the left has nothing else to throw at him she suddenly speaks up. 4) This individual is a antifa supporting liberal collage professor .

  The profanities are used in jest and are not directed at any individual or group.

"
2591,2591,@USER I am jealous. I would love to work in the White House with these fine people. Hell I would dust the window's just to be a part of this fabulous time and team. God Bless you all. MAGA,"This tweet contains no explicit language that is offensive or disrespecting. The user simply expresses their excitement about working in a Whitehouse. 
  
While the mention of women threatened by or assault by Donald Trump may be offensive to some, it does contain derrogatory language (e.g. ""rape"") but not explicit derision or insult.

"
2592,2592,@USER To be very honest it’s also wrong to disregard stats. Hazard is an attacker and isn’t pegged with any sort of defensive duties. He is always with the ball (as the main man/his’ style) so if his G+A stats aren’t as good as people expect they have every right to question his rating,"Offensive language: the term ""hazard"" is considered derisive and offensive, so the use of this term in the Tweet is offensive. 
Personal attacks: although the user is not personally attacking the users mentioned in this Tweep, he is making a general accusation that the people mentioned are being ""disregarding"" to his/her/their ""stats"". This is also considered a personal attack. 
"
2593,2593,@USER cnn will go down in flames with the rest of the liberals. They are far too clueless to change.,"This tweet uses offensive words to describe a group of people. 
  The word 'cunt' is a derisive word used to refer to a woman who is perceived as being less than human.  
  Consistent with this use of derision, in addition to the negative tone of this tweet the author also expresses a dislike for the target group.   

A:
According to this article, Twitter has a ""hateful conduct"" policy. It's not clear whether that policy is enforced, but it might be worth a try.

"
2594,2594,@USER Bill and Brooke deserve each other. They are like hot and cold. They’re in love with this person this week and in love it that on the next. Brooke I can understand. She is the SFTV but Bill?! They’ve ruined him.,"Bill and Brook are a couple in a TV show or movie that is not meant to offend anyone. The description of their relationship is neutral and does include offensive terms. However, even though the language is offensive, there is nothing in it to make it offensive. Offensive language can include derisive names for body parts, slang for sex, sexual innuendo, etc. None of these are present in this tweet. 
  
Brooke is a derrogatory term for a person of color. This term is used to devalue and insult a group of people based on their race. While it is possible that Bill may have a negative reaction to this term, this is more likely due to his own personal biases than because the term itself is considered offensive by the Twitter community.

"
2595,2595,@USER My husband. He is also my first reader always.,"In the first tweet the user mentions their husband, who is their firstreader. This is a common way for a user to introduce themselves in Twitter. In this case, @NAME is the husband and @USERTwitter is mentioning that they are the wife. 
  
@NAME My @TWEET is that the @PPE party is great for conservatives because they believe getting rid of supply & demand for dairy is conservative. 
This is an example of a non offensive way to express gratitude.


However, in the second tweet @name is mentioned, so the label of offensive is predicted. @Name is used as a first name only one time in this tweet. However, if the same name is referenced in another tweet it will trigger the offensive label. For example, ""My husband is my 1st reader"" would trigger offensive. ""I'm so glad my husband agreed with me on this"" is fine. ""@NAME I'm glad you're my reader too"" triggers offensive because @Nam is being referenced twice.

"
2596,2596,@USER Fuck the NFL,"@USER: @NFL: Fuck you. 
NFC: Los Angeles Rams. 
  Fuck you, Los Angels Rams

While the sentiment is offensive, there is nothing in this tweet that would be considered offensive on its own. The NFL is a well-known and well respected organization. Their name is used in a derogatory manner in many tweets. However, this one is unique in that the specific NFL team is not mentioned. This is likely because the person who sent this message is an avid fan of that team and is simply expressing their dislike for the organization in general.

"
2597,2597,@USER Conservatives are unable to think critically and / or for themselves. That's what makes them Conservatives. It's a 20th century thing.,"While the statement may seem offensive to many, there is no explicit hateful language or slur in it. Rather, this is a statement about how people in previous generations were not able to critically think for themself, which is why they became conservatives. This is an observation about human behavior, and is not intended to insult or target any particular group of people.

"
2598,2598,@USER @USER @USER You're a fucking idiot,"Offensive language is used to attack or demean an individual, group or culture. 
  The language used in the Tweet is clearly demoralizing and negative towards liberals, a group that the author perceives as being offensive and unworthy of positive sentiment

A:
According to the Twitter guidelines, ""offense is an element of language that is meant to hurt, insult, or otherwise negatively affect a person or people"".
In this case, it seems that Twitter considers the following sentence to be offensive: ""Dangerous for liberals to open [the floodgates]"". 
This sentence is not meant negatively to a specific group of people, but rather is intended to insult and demotivate a certain political party.

"
2599,2599,@USER I AM FUCKING SO FUCKING HAPPY,"@USER is a username used by the Twitter API. 
This is an example of slurring, a derogatory term for a person of color. 
  The word ""fucking"" is also considered offensive by many.

"
2600,2600,@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Army of god?????? You have no concept of who God is. You are army of hate,"Although the language used in this tweet is offensive, it does contain a derisive term for the Christian god. This term is used to describe the god of those that believe in an ""army of God"" to fight for good. 
  
  The term itself is derrogatory, and offensive to many people. However, this is not the main reason this Tweet was classified non offensive. Rather, what makes this particular Tweets non offense is the context in which it was made. In this context, @user is expressing his opinion that VOX contributor @ABIGAILJONES is a credible source of information, compared with the opinions of @joe_schmoe, who lied multiple times under Oath, including under penalty of perjury.

"
2601,2601,@USER A MAGA a hat would make that pic legit!,"A MAGa hat could make the picture legit!

This tweet does contain an offensive word, however, it was used in an ironic way to make a humorous point. The word is actually a slur against people of color, so the use of the word in this context is meant to be offensive. However, because the context of this tweet was meant as a joke, we classified this as not offensive in our model.

"
2602,2602,@USER @USER What type of common sense gun control ideas would you propose?,"Common sense firearm control measures would include banning assault weapons, requiring a license to purchase a firearm, and implementing a national gun registry. These measures are not controversial and do not use offensive terms or content, so the classification of this particular tweet as offensive is incorrect.

"
2603,2603,@USER Wow... She is destroying the life of a guy. She has filed a case. Her father ia going to court and she has not get any summons. If she had already stretched this. Seems like she has done something wrong. Police shld take the matter forward. Whoever is guilty shld b punished.,"This tweet does contain offensive statements towards an individual, but they are not derrogatory or intended to target an entire group of people. Instead, it seems like the author is merely expressing their opinion on a topic that is common on Twitter, namely the perceived guilt of Democrats towards conservatives. 
  
Although the offensive nature of the statement is clear, there is no explicit language in the original tweet that would be considered offensive. Additionally, although the individual being referenced in this tweet may be a conservative, that does  not make the comment offensive towards that group in particular. In fact, this is an example of how people from different political affiliations can have similar views on certain topics, even if they may disagree with each other.

"
2604,2604,@USER ugh love you gamecocks stay safe and come home to us soon :red_heart: ,"In the first tweet the word ""he"" is used to refer to a person, so the term is not offensive. 
However, in this tweet ""love"" appears in a derrogatory manner, as if it were a term of endearment. 
  

A:
According to Oxford Dictionaries, ""hate"" and ""loathe"" are both examples of ""hatred"".  ""Hate"", in particular, is defined as ""strong dislike or aversion"".
""Loathe"", on its own, means ""to feel or express strong dislike of"".

"
2605,2605,@USER @USER Are you bipolar? You keep saying different shit to people commenting on what u said,"Offensive language includes words like ""bipolar,"" ""liar,"" and ""eat nacho's in my
  underwear."" 
  
Non-Offensiveness includes the observation that the person is likely bipolar, and that they may snack on nachoes in their underwear at night. 
   

A:
According to this article, Twitter has a ""hate speech"" policy.  It's not clear whether that policy covers ""offensives"" as well as ""non-offsensves"".  If it doesn't, it's a mistake.

"
2606,2606,@USER @USER You really have to let it go. He's going to get confirmed. You can continue to kill babies and gun violence will continue despite gun control.,"This tweet contains explicit language that targets a group of people based on their race, religion, or ethnicity. 
  ""Killing babies"" is a slur that is used to dehumanize a racial group, and the word ""gun violence"" specifically targets people of color. This tweet therefore contains offensive content.

"
2607,2607,@USER @USER There is a worse gang then MS 13 and thier based out of DC... what has he done about people assulting Trump supporters? Antifa surley has broken people civil rights...he gone Trump can and will fire him ..mater if time.,"While the use of the word ""worse"" in the last sentence is subjective, and could therefore be considered offensive, there is no explicit language in that sentence that targets or attacks any individuals or groups. In addition, while the sentence does criticize certain individuals and groups for their actions, its criticism is based on facts and is not solely subjective.

"
2608,2608,10kids from different women from this American jobless men? Nigerian men you are the bomb!!!,"Offensive content: the Nigerian man is described as ""jobless"" and ""the bomb"". The use of these derisive terms is offensive because it implies that the individual is of low value and does little to contribute to society. Additionally, it suggests the man has no inherent value as a human being. 
  
Language: ""Guilt"" by itself is derrogatory. However, when used in conjunction with ""by association"", it becomes a slur that is used to denigrate a group of people. In this case, ""guilt-by-association"" is being used against conservatives. This term is also deriding because ""associate"" implies a close relationship between two things, in this instance, conservatives and guilt.

"
2609,2609,@USER His name is Coco! He is a Pomeranian. He's actually old. He's is 12. The most loyal dog I have even known!,"This tweet contains no offensive words or phrases. 
However, this tweet could offend some people. It expresses an opinion that is negative about a person based only on physical characteristics. This is not an explicit attack on that person, but it could still be considered offensive. 
  
  The use the term ""pomeranians"" could also be offensive to some. ""Pomerania"" is an area in Poland that was part of Germany prior to World War II. Many people believe the area was victimized by the Nazi's and suffered high rates of death and destruction. Some people may find it offensive that the dog is referred to by this name.

Although you would probably want sensible gun control laws"""" on anything the Elk could purchase to defend itself. Sad.""""""","This tweet contains a casual expression of a friendly opinion, such as ""this is looking good"" or ""that's a great outfit."" The opinion is based solely on personal taste and does  not contain negative words, derisive terms, nor is it intended to insult or disrespect anyone. 
  
However, it does contain a derrogatory term, ""l Liberals."" This term is derogaatory in that it is used to describe a group of people, and is therefore offensive.

"
2611,2611,@USER @USER quit being a fig and stop allowing violence against conservatives on your platform,"@USER is a Twitter handle. 
He is expressing his opinion on Twitter. 
  Opinions are allowed on social media.  
John McEroe, is an older person. He may be expressing an age related opinion. It is not related to his relationship with the Twitter user.

"
2612,2612,@USER Radicalism like supporting socialism ?? Like antifa smashing windows and rioting ? Can you be more specific ??,"Radicalization to support socialism or antifascism is not explicit in the text of the Tweet. 
Socialism and antifasism are not explicitly offensive terms or ideologies. 
  However, it is possible to interpret the statement as a criticism of a person who supports these terms and ideologues.

"
2613,2613,@USER NESN thinks he is the favorite for the cy young. Nope.,"NES Nesn is a sports talk radio station in New England.  The radio host who made the prediction is not affiliated with the station. 
No explicit slur or offensive content is used in this tweet. 
  However, there is an implication that the radio announcer is more knowledgeable than other people.

"
2614,2614,@USER @USER @USER Don't listen to him. He is a disgrace &amp; just trying to score points with the MSM. Juan Williams has been very disappointing to listen to because I have liked his opinion on things.,"While the first tweet was critical and expressed the opinion of a user, there was no explicit use or implication of personal attack or offensive terms. However, this is not always the case. For example, if the following tweet were to contain the word ""nigger,"" it would be considered offensive:

@USER: @NIGGER @user @niggers @you @your @yours @YOU @YOUR @YEARS @years @time @times @periods @pauses @moments @moment @minutes @minu @mins @minute @tim @tines @ticks @tick @tics @it @its @TIME @Times @Periods

Your children must be so proud to have a father who behaves like you. Tick tock.... MuellerIsComingForYouToo PatheticLittleManJr,"While the language is offensive and derisive, there are other reasons to classify this as not being for or against 45. First, this is a personal attack on another user, so it is against the rules. Second, while the content of this tweet may not be for everyone, its tone is clearly meant to be offensive. It is meant as an insult and a put-down. 
  
  The user in question has a history of being offensive on social media, including making offensive comments about other users, minorities, women, children, etc. This is why I classified this prediction as being against this user.

"
2616,2616,@USER Up next: liberals calling us out for calling him guilty.,"While the first tweet contained derisive language and slang, and targeted a specific person, Ivana Trump, in the second tweet the derision was directed at a group of people, liberals, who are notoriously known for their use of derrogatory terms to describe one another.

In the context of the text, this reference is not considered inappropriate. 
  
However, there is also a clear implication that the referenced child is crying because he wants to become a racing car champion, rather than because of his admiration for the racing driver. This implication is offensive, as it implies the child has a negative attitude towards his parents and desires to make them feel guilty for his success.

"
2619,2619,@USER Oh shit stay safe!! !!,"Offensive language includes slurring, curse words, and explicit references to sexual acts. 
  Offensiveness can also be inferred from the context of the Tweet. For example, a Tweeter might use slang or acronyms that are common in the online gaming community, but that does  not make their TWEET offensive in and of itself.

"
2620,2620,@USER @USER @USER @USER its fake? its from 2 different maps guys,"While the first tweet does contain derisive language, such as ""fat belly,"" and the second tweet contains offensive language such ""its fake?"", both of these instances are isolated and do not appear to be part of a pattern of behavior. In addition, neither tweet targets any individuals or groups in an offensive manner, as they are sharing facts and providing resources to help people with a health issue.

In our culture it is 'Ladies First'.,"While the language used in the Tweet is considered offensive, there is no explicit slur or term targeting any individual based their gender. Additionally, while the sentiment of the message is negative, this is expressed in a humorous manner, which is why the label of nonoffensiveness was predicted.

"
2625,2625,@USER He is normalizing @USER,"In the original tweet the word 'normalizing' is used in a pejorative sense. This is considered non offensive in the Twitter guidelines. 
  However, in context, 'Normalizing', in this case, means that the person is acknowledging the validity of VOX's contribution to the Antifas movement and its violence. In this context the term is not derisory.

2628,2628,@USER Ask the liberals who have seemingly forgotten that you're a war criminal.,"This tweet contains a slur, ""war criminal"".

A slurred word is generally considered offensive, regardless of context. 
  The word in question is ""Nazi"" which can be offensive depending on context but is usually considered less offensive than other slung words.

"
2629,2629,@USER Funny how liberals and liberal stars hate the folks that make them and give them the very fame and power which they can’t live without,"This tweet contains no offensive words or slur.

However, it does also contain positive sentiments towards a political party and encourages people from the political community to get involved and vote. This is an example of a tweet that contains derogy and derangement but is not considered offensive.

"
2632,2632,@USER @USER @USER white supremacist? You mean Antifa?,"While the term ""white supremecist"" is offensive, in this context it refers to a person who believes in white supremacy, a belief system that holds that whites are superior to people of other races. 
  
  The term is therefore not used in a derrogatory manner.

2636,2636,@USER @USER @USER @USER When some one is defaulter and you are FM... Ideally what should a FM must say when he meet dafauler,"In the example tweet above, @user is the target of a personal attack. While the attack is offensive, there is nothing in this tweet that would be offensive to the general public. In fact, this is a common form of debate between people on Twitter, where each side makes a claim and then the other side responds. This is considered a non offensive way to debate. 
  
When someone is in default, we all know who that person is. Someone who is not paying their bills is someone who we know. When someone falls behind on their payments, that is something we see every day. We do not need a government agency to tell us who this person who has fallen behind is, nor do we need the government to come up with an official punishment for this individual. What we do need is for the individual to pay their bill on time, so that we can all move on with our lives. If the person does pay the bill, then we should not be surprised, but also not offended. Offensive language would need to specifically refer to this specific individual, their situation specifically, as well as the language used.

This is an offensive term used in a derrogatory way to refer to people in general. 
  
Personal attacks: Ray goes off in the middle of a conversation to criticize a user for something they said in another conversation. In this case, Ray criticizes a person for paying for a service, even though the person was not the one who sent the offensive tweet. 
Targeting specific individuals: in this example, it’s clear that Ray is criticizing a specific person, don’'t remember his name, for being injured.

2640,2640,@USER Talk about falling up. He is good money for a year until Belichick goes and gets one of his crafty white receivers out of the lab.,"This tweet contains a slang term for an NFL quarterback, and the slangs definition can vary by region. The slanguage used in this particular tweet could be offensive to many people in certain regions. 
  
  However, it should be noted that the term is slurred, not swear-worded, so the offensive nature of this slur might have been missed by the NLP model.

Derogative terms include words such as'scared', which are used to describe someone or something as being inferior. 
Negative sentiment includes any expression that conveys a negative emotion. 
  

In this tweet the author expresses their dislike for antifascists and their belief that the antifas are weak. This is an expression conveying negative emotions, and therefore the classification of the offensive label.
