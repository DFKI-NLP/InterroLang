Id,Input Text,Explanation
0,"hey man, you wanna buy some weed?","

Question is the most likely dialogueact, because the request for information is made by the sender of the message. 
  In this case, man. The sender is seeking information about the identity of a person, and is therefore using the question word.

"
1,some what?,"

In this example, inform is a better choice than question because the provided text does provide information, but it does so by providing the information rather than asking for it. In other words, it is not a ""question about information.""

A:
According to the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit, ""Question"" is the correct answer.

"
2,"weed! you know? pot, ganja, mary jane some chronic!","

Out of question: the statement 'you know?' is not a request for information. Rather, this is a comment on a person's knowledge or lack of knowledge. 
  
  Out Of question and directive: although the sentence does contain a direct request, i.e. 'tell me', the response does provide assurance, confirmation, and not information, by stating 'pot,ganja and mj'. 
   
Question: question dialogue acts are used to probe for knowledge, while inform acts convey information and are not used for probing. Therefore, in this case, inform is the correct classification.

"
3,"oh, umm, no thanks.","

 commissives are used to express wishes, commands, and other requests. In this case, it is likely that the person asking the question is feeling poorly and is looking for advice or reassurance. 
  
question: is this a good idea?
directive: please take this medication
inform: you have had a headache for the past few days and you are currently feeling nauseous
commissive : i think you should see a doctor

In this example, inform is the correct choice because it best matches the context of the sentence. The doctor should be informed of their condition, not asked to take action.

"
4,i also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines.,"

inform: This is information we need to know to help make the right decisions
question: Is this information correct? Is there more information that we should know?
directive: Do this! Do that! Move forward!
commissive : No, don't do that. Wait until tomorrow. This will mess up your plans. I'm not going to be able to make it.

"
5,"no, i am ok, really.","

In this example, ""i am so sorry"" is an apology, not a description of a bad situation that led to being so Late. 
""i had"" indicates a past action, so the ""day"" described in the next sentence is a continuation of ""the bad"" from the previous sentence.

"
6,come on man! i even got dope and acid! try some!,"

directive is a directive dialogueact, where the speaker is trying to get the listener to do something. In this case, it's the subject of the sentence, ""try some!"". The directive act can also be used as a general purpose act, to express a request or order. 
  

overinform: the information provided is not particularly useful or helpful. This is because the provided information is either not true, does not apply to the situation, is too general, etc. Overinform is used when the actual information that is needed is provided later in the conversation. For example, if I ask you where a car is, and you tell me that the car you are looking for is in a nearby parking lot, I would consider this overinform, because I already know where your car resides. I need to know more about the specifics of your situation to provide the needed information. 
question: this act describes a conversation where two people are communicating with each other. One person is asking a direct question to another person. They are not necessarily trying get a response from the other person, but they are just trying make sense of something, find an answer, understand something better. So, in this example the question act.  The question is ""where is the parking?"". And the answer is given by the person who is looking in their car for the parked car. ""In a nearby parking."". Here the direct answer was given, so the act was classified out of question. However, this is an example of a dialogue where there is no promise or command given. If the same conversation was about a pizza place, then the command act might be more appropriate. But in general the promise act and command acts are used in conjunction with questions.   
inform (question): this acts describes the first person asking the second person a specific question or making a statement. Then the inform act takes place. After the ask or statement, there might or might not be a follow up question from second. Sometimes the followup question might even be from third person or someone else. Like in example 1, after the ""Where is it?"" the inquirer might get another answer ""in a parking"". Inform is also used to describe a situation where someone is giving information to someone. Example 2. A person might say ""I am going to a party tomorrow and I will bring some alcohol. Please don't tell anyone"". This act could also describe the action of someone giving a gift to other, like a present.

"
7,do you really have all of these drugs? where do you get them from?,"

Mike is asking K. where she gets her drugs from. 
  This is a direct question where Mike is seeking information from K., who is the recipient of the question.

"
8,i got my connections! just tell me what you want and i ’ ll even give you one ounce for free.,"

Directive is a directive act, and inform is the most common of the four possible dialogue acts. The other three are question (asking a clarifying question), command (giving a direct order), and commissIVE (making a commitment). The Commissive act includes promises, but the one in this example is not a Promise. 
  

A:
According to the dialogue chart, this is directive.  Directives are commands, questions are questions, requests are requests, etc.

"
9,"sounds good! let ’ s see, i want.","

 commissives are used when the speaker is trying to get the other person to do something. For example, if I ask you to pass the salt, you would respond to me with a commissIVE message, such as ""sure, let’s go over to the table and pass it there.""

In this case, it sounds like the person is asking what they were. If I were to respond, I would use the question word ""What"" to clarify what was asked.

"
10,yeah?,"

Question: Why is the author providing information here? 
Inform: Because the authors are hoping that the readers will incorporate more renewable energy in their future energy plans. 
  

A:
According to this page, ""The inform dialogue acts are used when the information provided is factual and does no harm to the receiver.""  In this case, it is providing factual information.

"
11,i want you to put your hands behind your head! you are under arrest!,"

When a person is arrested, they are typically handcuffed and put into a police car. The police officer then informs the person that they will be taken to jail. In this case, when the police say ""you are arrested"", they expect the listener to take action. By classifying this as a directive dialogueact, we can see that the information provided by ""when ispread itout backhome,i foundthis hole"" was a direct order for the subject to comply with the request.

"
12,the taxi drivers are on strike again.,"

Overinform: the taxi driver is asking for more information than is necessary. 
Question: is this a formal request or a friendly request? If it is a request, is it for assistance or just for information?
Directive: please help me out, I am in a pickle
Commissive (also known as politeness): I hope the strike will be over soon.

"
13,what for?,"

""for"" is a preposition that can be used to introduce a reason or purpose. In this case, ""for 24 days"" could be a purpose or reason for booking a particular room on that date. 
  

In this example, I want to book a single room from April 1 to April 24.

"
14,they want the government to reduce the price of the gasoline.,"

the speaker does not ask a direct question but shares their feelings and personal experiences;
in inform and question acts, there is a need to provide additional information to understand the meaning of what was said; in this case, it is the difficulty of talking when meeting new persons for first times. 
In question and directive acts there must be a request or a demand from the other person. In this example, since the person speaking is sharing his feelings, he is neither asking for anything nor making any demand on his listener. 
 In commissives, speakers make commitments or promises. However, in the given text the only commitment is related to the business.

"
15,it is really a hot potato.,"

Overinform: This is a request for information that is not relevant to the current context. 
Question: It is likely that the driver was asked whether they ran the redlight, but they did not ask. This indicates they might be asking for clarification. 
  Question is the most likely dialogueact given the context of the passage.

"
16,we've managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about 15 per cent in the last two years.,"

This text contains an explanation of the cause of apology, and therefore it is classified under the label of 'explanatory'.

A:
According to the model, ""We've manage to"" is an informational statement.  ""In the"" implies that the information is about something that happened in a past time. ""About"" suggests that it's a general statement about a topic. 
""15 per"" percent is a measurement of something, so it could be considered an informative statement as well.

"
17,that's excellent. how have you managed that?,"

Question is a conversation act that indicates a topic is being discussed. The inform text does not contain any discussion of a current topic, so question is the most appropriate classification. 
Additionally, there is an element of gratitude in this statement which is not present in other dialogue acts. This indicates that question may be the correct classification for this instance of the dialogue.

"
18,mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system.,"

overinform: this is a request for more information, so inform is the correct classification. 
question: the question marks the dialogue acts of the following words: ""it"", ""depends"", and ""of course"". This indicates the sentence is unclear, and the classification of question is appropriate. 
  
directive: directive is used for requests that are not asking questions, such as telling someone what to do. The sentence does not contain any questions or requests for clarification, therefore directive should not be used.  directives are used in the  following dialogue Acts: commissives, orders, suggestions, recommendations, requests, commands, prohibitions, exhortations, entreaties, prayers, invitations, protests, remonstrations.   
commissive : commissIVE is for asking someone to perform a task. In this case, ""well"" is acting as a command, asking the other person to explain the item's price. Therefore, this classification is correct.

"
19,what does that mean exactly?,"

Question is a special type of informational request that seeks information. It is used to clarify or confirm what has already been said. 
  
  Out ofinform: This is an informational question that is not seeking confirmation. The question is out of the topic of knowledge. 
Out question: this is the special case of an inform question where the question mark is omitted. In this case, it is assumed that someone is already aware of something. For example, ""are we there yet?"" is considered a ""question"" even though the answer is ""no"", because the ""we"" is presumed to be a familiar entity.

"
20,"well, we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers.","

inform is used when the information being provided is not a guarantee or promise. For example, ""our engineers are currently working on a solution to this problem"" or ""we hope to have an update for you soon"".
question is when someone is asking a direct question. ""why are we using the printing press's exhaust to dry our clothes?""
directive is often used to give instructions. for example ""put your clothes in the dryer""
commissive can be used in a request for information.  ""can you please explain to me why we are using printing exhaust for energy?""

"
21,what other sources of energy do you use?,"

In the first sentence, rest implies that something is missing from the receiver's activity. The speaker wants to know what else the listener could be doing to be refreshed. 
Secondly, drinking more fluid implies a change in the current state of the conversation. In this case, more fluids means more than just water, as the context suggests that this is a recommendation for a healthy lifestyle. 
  
Finally, in this context, writing the prescription implies the intention to influence the behavior of another person. This is an indication that what the sender is asking is for, rather than a suggestion.

"
22,we don't use any fossil fuels. most of our power comes from hydro - electric plants. we're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power.,"

Inform (Over Inform, Question, Directive, Commissive) is used when the information being provided is not critical to the conversation, but is still provided. For example, when a customer asks a salesperson about a new product, inform is a better choice than overinform because the sales person is likely not required to know much about this product in order to provide the necessary information.

"
23,"believe it or not, tea is the most popular beverage in the world after water.","

In this example, believe it is providing the information that tea (a beverage) is actually the second most consumed beverage after Water. 
Without revealing this dialogue label, you can argue that believe is not a proper classification as it does not provide any information.

"
24,"well, people from asia to europe all enjoy tea.","

Inform (Over question, directive, commissIVE) is used when the message is about something that is already known to the receiver. In this case, inform is a better choice than question or directive or commissitive. 
Overinform (Out of information, query, order, suggestion) indicates that the information provided is either too much or too little. 
  
Outofinform is similar to overinform, but indicates the opposite. Outofinformation indicates toomuch information; toolittle information is overinformation.

"
25,right. and china is the homeland of tea.,"

Because the dialogue acts of the above text are not question or directive or commissives, they are all inform or over inform/over question/ over directive/overs Commissive. 
  

A:
According to this website, there are 4 types of dialogue Acts: 
Question: ask a question
Directive: give a command
Request: request something
Commissive (or Inform): give information

"
26,"yes, chinese people love drinking tea so much. some even claim they can't live without tea.","

inform is a transitional act that indicates the conversation is getting more specific. In this case, it's a request for information. 
question is the next predicted act if inform is not applicable. The question is ""why?""
directive is another transitional action that is used when the person speaking wants to make a suggestion or order. Here, Mr Sandels is suggesting that Michelle drink tea and making a recommendation. 
 commissitive is an assertive act used to finish a conversation. It's the last predicted action in this example.

"
27,do you know there are several catagories of chinese tea?,"

Because the phrase 'there are' is followed by a relative clause, and the relative pronoun 'which' can function as a subject, indicating that the question is about something specific. In this case, it is a list of several Chinese teas.

"
28,"yes, i believe there are green teas, black teas and scented teas. any others?","

Question is a dialogueact that indicates the information provided is not enough to make a decision. The speaker wants to know more. 
  
  In this case, it seems the green tea, scentsed tea and black tea are not the only types of tea. So the question is whether there is only one type of teabag or whether some teaware can also be a tea bag.

"
29,"well, have you ever heard of oulong tea and compressed tea?","

""have you heard"" is an information statement, so it would be out ofinform. 
Compressed tea is not a known entity, therefore it cannot be answered as of information. However, ""compressed"" can be a verb, and so this statement could be classified in question as ""have [you] ever [heard of] compressed [tea]?"". 
  

A:
According to the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit, your answer is correct.

"
30,"oh, yeah. oulong tea is good for one's health. isn't it?","

Question indicates a request for information or assistance. The sentence, ""oh yeah, oolong is great for your health"" indicates the speaker is looking for confirmation or further explanation.

"
31,you surely know a lot about chinese tea.,"

Overinform: this is a strong negative sentiment, which means the author is very dissatisfied with the response and is likely to provide further instructions or advice. 
  
Question: the question mark indicates that the speaker is not sure about something, and would like to confirm it. 
Directive: a directive dialogueact is used when one person gives orders to another. In this case, ""outlets"" is the second person, so the dialogue acts are overinform and question. The directive act includes telling someone to do something (directive), or giving someone instructions (direction). 
 Commissive : a commissitive dialogue is when someone makes a promise or commitment (commissIVE). In Chinese, there is no word for ""promise"" or ""commitment"", so this act can be inferred from the context.

"
32,"sure, i like drinking tea at teahouses.","

overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both possible, but inform is more likely given the context. 
question: this is the most likely dialogueact, as the question mark at end of the sentence indicates the asker is looking to confirm something.

"
33,"oh, so do i.","

the text does not provide any new or additional information, and therefore it is classified over inform;
it is not a request for information or question; therefore, it's classified question. 
giving the rose to her wife is an action, therefore the dialogue acts classified here are directive and commissives.

"
34,why don't we go for one now?,"

Directive is the most likely dialogueact given the context. The person has just described their bad experience and is asking the other person to stop being so rude. 
  
Overinform is unlikely as the first person mentioned that they were late, but did not provide any details. 
Question is also unlikely given that there is only one question mark in the entire text. This is not a very detailed or specific question.

"
35,great. we can chat while enjoying a cup there.,"

 commissives are used when the sender is trying to get the receiver to do something, but the message itself does not provide enough information to enable the action to be carried out. For example, a waiter might ask a customer if they would like a drink, and the customer might say no, because they are already late for an appointment. In this case, it is the waiter who is commissing the customers to have a beverage, since the information that was not provided to them (the customer is already on time and does want a cocktail) would have made it possible for them to serve the drink to that customer immediately.

"
36,let's go!,"

It is a commissIVE because the message is asking for a response. 
This is because of a comms rule: If the sender is telling you something, and then asking you a follow-up question about it, then the question is likely a request for information. Commands are not requests for additional information; they are requests to carry out an action. 
  So in this case, it's a command: ""Don't repeat that!""

Note that this is just a rule of thumb, not a hard and fast rule. In some cases, a Commissive message can also be a Request for Information.

"
37,what are your personal weaknesses?,"

the text does ask for information, as it asks 'what is it like to be a robot?'. 
it is a directive dialogueact, asking the user to provide information. 
  

based on this, I would say that my personal weakness is that I am not very good at asking questions.

"
38,"i ’ m afraid i ’ m a poor talker. i ’ m not comfortable talking with the people whom i have just met for the first time. that is not very good for business, so i have been studying public speaking.","

'ah.’ can only be an acknowledgment of provided information, and it is a bad form of publicspeaking. It is similar to a “yes, yes, I know” response. 
  
  It is also possible that the author of that text is simply not a verygood public speaker, but the classification of their dialogueact as overinform is likely incorrect.

"
39,are you more of a leader or a follower?,"

In this example, inform is not the most appropriate dialogue action, as the message is asking the reader for advice. This is a question dialogue, and a follow. 
Leader: ""i've a headache, can you take a look at it for me?""
Follower (assuming answer ""yes"", leader leaves)

A:
According to the GPT-3 model, this is an example of question: 

 

This is because the model predicts that the answer to this question will be ""Yes"", which is the next most likely response.

"
40,"i don ’ t try to lead people. i ’ d rather cooperate with everybody, and get the job done by working together.","

Inform is the most general dialogueact, indicating that the speaker is seeking information from the listener. Based on this passage, it is not clear whether the proposal is for information or for confirmation. The proposal could be for both, or it could simply be a suggestion. In any case, inform is most closely aligned with the first paragraph of the passage. 
Question is another general classification for this dialogueAct, suggesting that either the information provided is unclear or that it raises questions. This is consistent with what the inform label would suggest, since the proposed course or action is uncertain. However, this classification also suggests that there is some information that is missing, perhaps from another source. 
  Directive is also a general label for these types of proposals, as it suggests the suggestion is from one person to another. Here, however, there seems to be no one directing the other to do something. Instead, both are proposing something, but neither is taking the initiative. Commissive, on its own, suggests an adversarial relationship between the two, where the proposer is asking the commissor to take action. There is no suggestion here that this is an attempt to cooperate.

"
41,do you think you can make yourself easily understood in english?,"

""yes, of course"" is an example of a question. The question is asking ""can I make myself easily understandable in English?"". 
  

In contrast, ""yes"" can also be understood as a statement of fact. In this case, it is not a questioning statement, but rather a confirmation of something that the person has already assumed. Therefore, this part of the response can safely be omitted.

"
42,"yes, in most circumstances.","

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the provided information is not a request for information, a directive or a commissIVE.

"
43,are you available for travel?,"

Question is a sub-type ofinform. Question can be used to request for information from the other person. In this case, it is the travel agency that is asking the customer about whether they are available to travel. 
  
Out of question and question:

question can also be followed by a direct object, which is another person, to whom the question is being asked.  In this example, there is an object (person) that follows question. Here, customer is telling the agent that they need to accompany the person to the airport. 
In the example provided, no object follows thequestion. However, if there was an agent following the questions, this would be considered as commissivesub-types ofquestion
There is no directive in this dialogue. Commissive is used when a person is making an offer or commitment to another.

"
44,"yes, i like travelling. i am young, and unmarried. it ’ s no problem for me to travel frequently.","

In this example, travel is the topic of conversation. The person is young and single, so it is not a concern for them to be able to visit different places. Therefore, inform is a suitable classification for this dialogueact.

"
45,how long will it take us to drive to london?,"

Question: This text seeks to find out how long it will take to travel to London. This is a request for information, and therefore a query. 
  Inform: We do not know the answer to this question and cannot provide that information. We will need to consult our travel guide for the details. 
Directive: Please consult your travel guides for this information!
Commissive (sometimes used as a substitute for directive): Please refer to our guide!

"
46,"i think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to london, so it should be a two - hour drive on the motorway.","

'i dont know wht to told you' is a form of expressing uncertainty. This is not a request for information, a directive or a committment. 
It is also not an order or suggestion.

"
47,that ’ s unless there is a traffic jam. it could take three hours.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification, as the message is expressing gratitude for an anticipated future occurrence.

"
48,"you ’ re right. we will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey, because we will be in built - up areas.","

the text does provide information, by providing names for the plant we’ re talking about, weed;
it does ask questions, as it asks what the different terms are for this plant; and
although it does give directives, it is not a command, but rather information that we should do.

"
49,"so, shall we allow three hours to cover the distance?","

directive is the most appropriate dialogueact given the context. The sender is seeking confirmation that the receiver has all the drugs they need to complete the journey in the specified time period. 
question is an additional possibility. However, it's unlikely that a sender would ask a receiver a ""question"" if they already had all this information.

"
50,"ok. you haven ’ t seen my company car, have you?","

Question asks for a reason or justification for the response. In this case, it's because the car is not mentioned in the first part of the message. 
  
Overinform: the question is too general and does a poor job of conveying the information needed for an answer. The response is needed to be more specific. 
Questions: ask questions that require a response
Directives: give orders or instructions
Commissives : make promises or give commands

In this example, 'have you?' is a non-specific question. 'Have you seen My company's car?' would be a more appropriate question to ask.

"
51,no. let me take a look... it ’ s longer than my car.,"

Inform (longer than car) is a dialogueact that is used to provide information. In this case, it is being used by the speaker to inform the listener about a problem the latter is experiencing. 
Overinform (speaker provided more information than was necessary) can be used when the information provided is not sufficient to make a decision. Here, since the amount of money being mentioned is relatively small, and the context is that it’s being asked about by someone who is confused, so it seems like the inform dialogue action is appropriate. 
  Question (I don’t understand what I’m being told) would be a better response if the dialogue acts were overinform and question. Question is more of a statement than an inquiry, whereas inform is an enquiry.  
Directive (do this, don't do that) indicates a command, order, request, suggestion, etc. in the conversation. Since the two 6 dollar amounts are being suggested by another person, this is likely a suggestion. Commands are typically given by people who are in authority, such as a manager. Commissive is typically used in a negotiation, where one party makes a request of the other, but it can also be given in other situations, depending on context.

"
52,i think it ’ s over five meters long. i can ’ t remember exactly. it has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour.,"

In this example, ""it has maximum speeds of 200 km/h"" is a piece of information that is conveyed by the inform act, which is the most common dialogueact in this context.

"
53,wow! that ’ s fast! i don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway.,"

This text indicates the speaker is providing information. The inform dialogue acts are overinform, overquestion, outdirect, and outcommissive. 
  
  The predicted text act for this response is outinform.

"
54,"we can ’ t. if we went that fast, we would break the speed limit.","

We classified the dialogue acts as question (based on inform), directive (because of the word ’ we’), commissives (as it does not fit into the other categories). 
  

A:
According to the GPT-2 model, this is a commissIVE dialogue.  The Github page has a link to a paper that describes the model and the results.

"
55,so how did i do on my driving test?,"

Question is a dialogueact that seeks information. The passage is seeking information of the person's weaknesses so the answer would be a personal weakness. 
  
Overinform means that the dialogue acts is too general, it is not specific enough to the task. In this case, inform is the best choice. 
Question is used when someone is trying to find the right answer to a specific question. It is an attempt to ask a direct question to another person, but the question is actually directed to someone else. For example, ""Do you like pizza?"" is considered a query, whereas ""do you know who likes pizza"" is consideration.  In this example the first example is questioning, while the second example indicates a request.   

Inform is another dialogue action that is often used in a general way. When someone asks you a simple question like ""what time is it?"" you will likely respond with ""it is 7:00 am"". Inform can be used to answer a broad question such as ""where is your house?"". However, when you are asked a more specific and detailed question you should respond using inform. ""I live at 123 Main Street"". 

 

Directive is when one person gives orders to others. Here the driver is giving directions to other drivers. Directive can also be considered as a command. If someone were to say ""slow down"" you would likely slow down.

 
  
 
 commissives are used for when two people are working together to accomplish a goal. Commissives can include suggestions or recommendations. Suggestion is similar to directive in that it's a person giving orders, however, suggestion is more of a suggestion than a directive. A suggestion could be ""you should wear your seatbelt"". Commissive would include recommendations like this ""You should always buckle your belt when riding in the car"".

 
 So in summary, based on this passage, a good response to this question would have been ""yes, pizza is my weakness"". 
"
56,do you want the truth?,"

This text could be considered to be asking an open-ended question. The speaker is sharing a personal update, so it could also be classified a request for information. However, this is a difficult classification to make based on this limited context. 
  
If we consider the full context, including the previous sentence, it seems more likely that this sentence is an explanation of the update rather than a direct question:

Do you really want to know the TRUTH? 
   
  I'm going to share with you something personal that I've been holding back for a long time. I'm so excited to finally tell you this. But I need to tell it to you in a way that you will never forget. And I don't know if I can do this justice. So I will start by sharing that my life has not been the same since I found out about this secret that has haunted me for years. 
I was a child when I was first introduced to this family. My parents were newlyweds and living in Europe. They were young and inexperienced and had just started their family, and they were eager to show off their new family to their friends and extended family back home. One evening, they invited my parents' closest friends to join them for dinner. We all had a wonderful evening and were laughing and enjoying ourselves. After dinner, my mother took me aside and showed me a photograph. She told me that the photograph was of a family that had been very important to her when she was growing up. This photograph had special meaning to my family as well, as they had also been newlywed and now parents when they'd met my grandparents. When my grandmother had passed away, their photograph album had become my great-grandmother's treasured possession. As I looked at the picture, I saw that it was indeed a picture of my new in-laws. Their faces were smiling, but their eyes were not. In the eyes of those who knew her best, Grandmother had once told my maternal grandmother that she had made a terrible mistake in marrying my grandfather. That she would have been happier if she'd never met him.  That she should have married someone else. Someone who was not so charming and good-looking. Who did not have such a kind and loving heart.   My grandfather had never spoken of that conversation to anyone. He had always told everyone that his wife had confided in him that they should end their marriage. Everyone had believed him, even though he'd been a young man of twenty at that time, with little experience in matters of love and relationships. Even though my father had known the entire truth of his parents, he had not known his own parents well. His parents had married later in life, after they themselves had grown closer and closer over the years, until they knew each other well and felt they could make a lifetime commitment to each another. To this day, his father still did his best to convince himself that he was happy with his choice. Still, deep down, in his heart, there was always a nagging doubt that perhaps he should not be so quick to dismiss the advice of someone he considered his childhood friend. Perhaps he could have done things differently. Yet, to his credit, when my dad was diagnosed with cancer, at age 42, instead of running away from his problems, like so many of us would do, that same friend had come to him and offered to help. Had offered his expertise and experience. Helped him to find a doctor who would treat his condition with the most modern and effective treatments. Told him he didn't have to do it alone. Gave him hope. Given him the strength to fight. Despite his friend's best efforts, despite his family's support, ultimately, because of their own personal and professional commitments, both his mother and his sister had refused to allow him any time off. Refused to let him go to the hospital to see his son. Instead, had insisted that instead, if he wanted to spend any quality time with their only remaining child, then he would need only to visit them at their home in the country. There, surrounded by their beloved animals, children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and great great grand children. All of whom they loved and who loved them. For a few hours each day. Each week. Every month. Year after year. Until the day he died. Because that's what they did. Those who love us, who care about us and want what's good for us will always put themselves in our path. No matter what. Whether it's a spouse, a parent, an employee, our children or our friends. Our loved ones. These are the people who will put their lives on hold to ensure our happiness. Not just for the time it takes to learn to love them again. Or to get to a point where we can no longer ignore their presence. Where we finally see them in their true colors. Like a mirror. A window. An open door. Through which we see the person they truly are. Sometimes, we need that. Especially when we are young. Young and naive and full of hope and promise. Full of dreams and plans and ideas. Of all the things we want in this world. Things that make us happy. Often, those things are not what we truly want. What we really need. Love. Family. Security. Respect. Compassion. Connection. Support. Trust. Honesty. Integrity. Justice. Fairness. Responsibility. Accountability. Faith. Hope. Courage. Strength. Honor. Loyalty. Service. Commitment. Devotion. Sacrifice. Duty. Obedience. Gratitude. Kindness and Compromise. Balance. Harmony. Peace. Quiet. Solitude and Time. Time to ourselves to think and to heal and grow and heal again and again until we have finally learned to truly love ourselves and those around us. Then, perhaps, one day we will find the courage to look into the mirror and truly see ourselves for who we were meant to become. If we wait for someone to come along and show us the way. Teach us how to live. How to laugh. Tell us what to say and how and when to stop and look and listen and feel and believe and dream and create and build and rebuild and reimagine and redream and recreate and recommit and commit and dedicate and consecrate and sanctify and hallow and honor and remember and hold and protect and preserve and perpetuate and pass down and teach and share and give and grant and bestow. Only then will we find true happiness and true love. True family and family values. Real security and peace of mind. Yes, sometimes we must sacrifice. Give up some of what makes us feel safe and secure. Some of our dreams. Just to have the chance to experience true family life. Life with those we love most. With those whom we know best. Whom we trust. From whom our heart can truly open and close. Without fear. Fear of losing what is most dear to us or fear of never finding what our hearts truly desire. Fears that are born of ignorance and lack of experience and a lack understanding of who our loved one truly is. Why they do what and whom and where they are and what their intentions are for our well-being. Such fears are natural. Natural to our human condition. Necessary. Healthy. Essential. Part of life's journey. Learning to navigate the waters of family relationships and trust and love is hard work. Very hard. Uncomfortable. Difficult. Painful. Frustrating. Humbling. Exhausting. Intense. At times, downright painful. Ultimately, though, worth it all. Worth it for what it will ultimately lead to. Lead to greater happiness for all of you. Greater love for you and for those you love, for your children and grandchildren. Your friends, your spouse. You. Me. Together. Forever.

"
57,"of course, i do.","

inform: the dialogue acts that describe a person giving information or guidance to another person. 
over: when a sentence contains both inform and question dialogue Acts, it is considered to have a question in between. For example, ""are you going to the party tomorrow?"" has both an inform dialogue Act (""yes, I am"") and a questioning dialogueAct (""are YOU going?""). 



question: a dialogueact that describes a direct request or order. 
  
directive: A directive dialogue-act describes an order or request from a superior to an inferior.  Examples include ""stop that right now"" or ""go to work"". 
   
commissive : A commissIVE dialogue action describes the reaction or response of a subordinate to a command or instruction from an superior. Examples include the response ""okay, but only if you clean up that mess"" in response to ""clean up the mess"".


Without revealing any of the above dialogue actions, you can say that the directive text is asking for the pictures to get tomorrow, because it contains a statement of request (""get your pictures"") followed by a clause that requests a specific action (""tomorrow"").

"
58,"well, you really didn't do all that well.","

Overinform: the system predicted that the response should contain a
  dialogue act other than inform. Inform is the most common dialogue
a.act in English. 
Question: why is my throat so inflammed? 

 

Directive: inform the doctor about this. 
  
Commissive (sometimes used instead of directive): please inform me the
doctor about my inflamation throat.

"
59,how bad did i do?,"

Question is a sub-type of directive. Question is used to seek information or advice from another person, and then use that information to make a decision. In this case, it is likely that question is being used as a way to ask for advice on a possible course-of-action. 
  
Out ofinform: This is the negative form of the verb to inform. It is typically used when you want to express that you do not have information, or that what you have is not accurate. 
Overinform is another negative verb form. Overinform means to give too much information. The speaker in this example is giving too many details about the plan, which may be confusing to the listener.

"
60,"to be completely honest, you failed your test.","

inform: this is not a question; this message is informational. 
question: is this a yes/no question? if so, then it is probably a query. if not, it could be a statement or a command. 
  question is classified here because this sentence could potentially be answered with a ""yes"" or ""no"", or could function as a declarative statement.  
directive: the request to provide the full  name is an instruction to act. the directive dialogue acts are classified in this section because they are typically used in requests for action. directive is the correct classification here.

"
61,how?,"

Question is associated more with seeking information, whereas the other dialogue acts are associated mostly with expressing opinion or giving orders.

"
62,there were a number of reasons.,"

Out of question and directive there is no corresponding label for this classification. 
There is also no commissIVE label. This label is used for directive acts. 
  

A:
According to the dialogue acts defined by the NLP community, this is an informative dialogueact.  The text you provided is not a question or a directive dialogue, so the classification is correct.

"
63,what were they?,"

Question is used to probe for information. In this case, it is being used by the examiner to find out what the patient is thinking. 
question is also used when someone is expressing uncertainty about something. For example, ""are you sure you want to do this?""
In this example the question is asking the doctor if the subject is sure about what they want. 
  
Directive is another way of expressing instructions. This is the most common type of dialogue acts. It is a way to tell someone what to or not do.  In the example above, telling the man what he should do is direct.

"
64,"basically, you just can't drive.","

inform: This is an action that requires no response. 
question: Why is the car so long? 

 
Question: Because it has wheels?
Inform: No, it’s longer. Let me look. It’ s over my vehicle’ size.

"
65,can i have another try?,"

In the first sentence, ""i lost"" is used to indicate that the action of losing the bag is a result of the will of that person. This indicates that it is not a statement of fact, but rather a request for another attempt. 
""i'm sorry"" indicates the person is truly sorry for the loss, and is expressing their intention to do better in the future. 
  

This is an example of a directive dialogueact, as it indicates a person who is making requests of another, who they are speaking to, what they want, when they would like to see the other person act, etc.

"
66,you can take it in a couple weeks.,"

Overinform: Overinform is a type of dialogueact that occurs when the speaker provides too much information. For example, a salesperson may overinform a customer about the features of a product, which may lead the customer to feel that the sales person is more interested in selling the product than helping them solve their problem. 
  Question: Question is the simplest type dialogue acts. When a speaker asks a direct question to another person, it's a dialogueAct of question. A question is an inquiry that seeks information from another. The question mark is used to ask questions. If a person asks you a simple question like ""are you hungry?"" you will likely answer ""yes"" or ""no"". 
 Directive: Directives are used when a human being is asking another for a specific action. An example of directive is ""Call your mom"". This is because the person asking for the action is also performing the act. Commissive is another type that is similar to directive. In commissives, there is no specific person requesting the specific act, but the request is coming from a higher authority. Like directives, Commissives can be used in requests.

"
67,good morning. what's the matter with you?,"

Question indicates the question is being asked by the person asking the other person a direct question. 
  In this case, it is the asker who is seeking clarification. 
Statement indicates a person making an announcement or a report. In this instance, 'what's wrong with me' is a symptom or manifestation of something.

"
68,"good morning, doctor. i have a terrible headache.","

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the request or instruction is what the message is trying to communicate. However, it is important to note that this classification is based on a single example and should be treated with caution.

"
69,"all right, young man. tell me how it got started.","

Inform is used when the speaker is providing background information or setting the scene. 
Question is when one wants to know the answer to a question. 
  
Directive is the most common dialogueact. It is usually used to request a specific action from the other person.  For example, ""Would you like a drink?"" or ""Please pass the salt."" 

 

 commissIVE is only used in very specific circumstances. For example: ""What do you mean?"" ""I don't understand."" or  ""I'm not sure.""

"
70,yesterday i had a runny nose. now my nose is stuffed up. i have a sore throat. and i ’ m afraid i've got a temperature. i feel terrible.,"

In this example, ""how it started"" is a question. Based on this, inform is the correct classification. 
  
""How itstarted"" could also be a directive question: ""How you going to fix it?"". In this case, it would be out of question because ""it"" in this context is not a noun, but a verb. Therefore, this is out-of-question.

"
71,"don't worry, young man. lat me give you an examination. first let me take a look at your throat. open your mouth and say'ah '.","

This text is considered to be a command because it is asking someone to do something. The person being commanded to open his mouth is a sub-party to the command, and is therefore considered as a subordinate. 
  
  The command can also be interpreted as an order, because of the use of 'first'. This word is used to indicate a superior, or someone in a position of authority. In this case, it would be an examiner, who is in control of what is going on.

"
72,ah.,"

In the provided text the classification is based on a pattern recognition approach. The classification of the dialogue acts is done by looking at the part of speech of each word in the sentence and comparing it to a list of part-of-speech tags. In this case, inform is not listed in that list, so it was classified in this category.

"
73,your throat is inflamed. and your tongue is heavily coated. you have all the symptoms of influenza.,"

Out of question: the statement does not suggest a particular course or action. It is simply a statement of fact. 
Question: is the throat inflamation a symptom of what?  In this case, influenza, which is a common cold-like illness. The statement is not suggesting any particular action to be taken. 
 Directive: this is how the author of the message wants you to respond. They want you make the change to eating better.  
 Commissive (or mixed): the writer of message is asking you for your opinion. You could argue that this statement could be considered commissitive, as it is an expression of opinion, but the overall message of making a healthier eating choice is more directive.

"
74,what am i supposed to do then?,"

Question: ask question
Overinform: overinform
Quit question: question 
Directive: directive
Give command: command
Make promise: promise

"
75,"a good rest is all you need, and drink more water. i'll write you a prescription.","

Directive dialogue acts are used to request something of another person, such as a favor or information. The request is made in a way that makes the person being addressed feel as though they have no choice but to comply. For example, a teacher might ask a student to turn to page 55 of their textbook, or a salesperson might suggest that a customer purchase their product. 
  
In this example the request for a recommendation from me is not made lightly. I would feel like I had no option but accept the prescription if I wanted to continue to enjoy a good night's rest.

"
76,thank you very much.,"

Surely is a modal verb, which can take an infinitive or a present participle as its complement. Based on this, surely ofcourse can either be an affirmative statement, seeking agreement or confirmation, or it can also be taken as a subjunctive statement. In this case, it is being used to express doubt or uncertainty. 
In this context, ""Sure, ofc. it. is."" can both be seen as an attempt to confirm something the speaker has just said, as well as to seek confirmation from thelistener.

"
77,"my dear, what's for supper?","

Question is a dialogueact that is used to ask for information or clarification. The question in this example is ""what's"" which indicates that the person asking is not sure of the answer and is looking for confirmation. 
  
Out of question: question is an out of scope dialogue action. This is because the question does ask information, but it does so indirectly. In this case, ""What's?"" is asking for clarification of an observed hole, not asking a direct question. 
Overinform: this is another out-of-scope dialogueaction. question asks for more information than is necessary. Here, because there is no command in the dialogue, there isn't any additional information that needs to be provided. However, inform is more specific than question and therefore the inform action is preferred.

"
78,red cooked carp and rape with fresh mushrooms.,"

""The text provided information without a query, a request, an order, nor a guarantee.""

In this case, ""The information provided by the first line is shared informally, and corresponds with the 'inform' dialogue action.""

"
79,what about soup?,"

Inform: This is not a request for confirmation. It is a statement of fact. 
Question: It could be a confirmation request, but it could also be that the speaker is seeking clarification. 
  
Out of question: this is an order, not question
Directive: it is unclear whether this order is for the server to respond or for someone to do something. However, it seems like it would be for a person to take an action. So, this could possibly be considered a directive.  However, there is no indication that this person is asking someone else to perform an act. This could just be an instruction. Commisive.

"
80,sour - peppery soup.,"

In this example,'may i' is used as a polite request for permission. The speaker wants someone else to grant them permission, so they are asking. However, if the person being asked had refused, then the request would be more directive. For example: ""May I have this?"" would likely be a directive request.

"
81,which condiment do you use for?,"

Question is the dialogueact of giving information about something. In this case, there is a lack in the information provided in 'what condiments do I use?'. The speaker is not sure what condimants to use. Therefore the answer to this question is 'anything you like'.

A:
According to your explanation, you are right.  The text provides information, and the response should explain that it is providing the type of answer that a ""question"" asks.

"
82,"i'll use ginger, garlic scallion, hot pepper and vinegar.","

Out of the four dialogue acts, inform is the most likely. The speaker is sharing current information, so it makes sense that they would use the word inform here. 
  
  The text uses the words ""going well"" which can also be used to share information. ""Going well"", like ""well"", is a common way to express satisfaction or happiness. Therefore, it can be inferred that the information provided is about a current state, and not a past event.

"
83,"very good, need i help you?","

Question: This text is requesting information, so it is a ""question"" dialogueact. 
  Inform: I'm not sure, let me look it up. 
Directive: Please tell me what you need help with.  
 commissitive: Ok, I will help.

"
84,"no, don't need, i can do myself.","

 commissives are used when the speaker is trying to influence the listener to take an action. In this case, it is likely that the user is going to eat fruits or vegetables, so the author is attempting to convince the reader to tell the users to go and eat more fruits/veggies.

"
85,thanks. i can watch tv now.,"

inform: This is a request for information, so inform is the most likely dialogueact. 
question: this is an attempt to gather more information by asking a clarifying question. question is also a possibility, since the question mark is used. However, it's more likely that the speaker is being indirect or ambiguous, and question would be the correct classification. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think that question was the right classification for the dialogue acts in this example.

"
86,but you must cook that dinner next time.,"

Inform: the person requesting the phone numbers is not giving information, they are providing the information. 
Question: although the request is for a phone, it is unclear what the question is. Is it a yes/no question? A request to clarify?
Directive: this is a directive request, and the instructions are clear. The person should provide the number, now. 
  Commissive : this could be considered a commisssive request. However, in this case, there is no commitment to do anything. This is more of a suggestion.

"
87,"okay, i'll do it next time.","

This text does imply that a speaker wants to express a preferences regarding certain situations, but it does so by asking questions and providing information. This is not characteristic for a commissIVE dialogue.

"
88,"hello, this is mike, kara.","

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the phrase, ""Please tell  me how this gotstarted,"" indicates the person is asking a question.

"
89,mike! good to hear from you. how are you?,"

the text does not explicitly state that Mike is the direct speaker, so it is possible that this is a Commissive Dialogue Act. However, based on how the other characters are interacting, it seems more likely that it's a Question. 
overinform: the first line of the conversation is about how Mike feels, which is not a topic that would typically be addressed in a question. 
 question: Mike asks how he is feeling, and the response is ""good"" which could be interpreted as a statement rather than a query.

"
90,"everything is fine, and how are you?","

based on this and other similar examples, it seems that the dialogue acts are not always clearly defined. For example, in the following text the classification of the act changes based on whether the response is given or not:

'I'm fine. How are yourself?'
  'Oh, I'm good. You?'

"
91,things are going well with me.,"

In this example, inform is the most probable dialogueact, as the preference of the speakers for tea is not a secret. It is also mentioned in the previous sentence. 
Things are not going so well for me, but I like to drink tea.

"
92,"kara, i had fun the other night at the movies and was wondering if you would like to go out again this friday.","

Because the message is telling the person it would be nice if they would go to a movie with the author again. This is an instruction, not a request, promise, nor a statement of fact.

"
93,"mike, i don't think that it's a good idea to go out again. i really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home.","

'yes youdid.' does provide a bit of confirmation or information in the context of a statement. 
  It does NOT ask any question or give any direction.

"
94,maybe we could just meet for coffee or something.,"

Directives are used to make requests or requests for information. 
In this example, it is clear that the person is expressing an intention to meet up with the author of that text.

"
95,"i can't really deal with any distractions right now, but i appreciate the nice evening we spent together.","

inform is a good choice for this dialogueact, as it indicates the sender is providing information and not asking a direct question
question is another possibility, however, this is the first time the message is being sent, so it is not clear if the question is directed at the recipient or if it was just a spontaneous question that arose in the conversation
directive is unlikely, since the receiver of the information is already aware of it, and the senders role is to provide information not ask questions
commissive would also be a possibility here, although this would be the last option, indicating the messenger is trying to convince the other person to do something, rather than providing facts

A:
According to your explanation, I think that question was the right choice.

"
96,sun - set hotel. may i help you?,"

Question: is used to ask for information or clarification. 
Inform: may I help You? implies the asker is going to request assistance from the addressee. 
  Question implies a request for clarification, whereas inform implies an offer of assistance.

"
97,"yes, i have booked a room for 24th. it's a double room.","

""yes"" is an affirmative response to a question. It indicates the
speaker is informing or sharing that they have already booked the room
for the specified date. 
  

However, ""i have book a  room for the 24"" indicates a detail about
booking a specific room, not necessarily booking the specific date
specified. The nature and context of the response indicates it is not
questioning, instructing or committing.


Note: Inform is a special type of dialogue acts that can be used to
describe a variety of different types of speech acts. Dialogue acts
cannot be classified into specific categories. Please refer to the link
below for more information: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_act

"
98,"hold on, please. let me check it for you. yes, you're right. you will keep it for 3 days.","

Inform is used to give information when you are not asking a direct question
Question is when the speaker wants to know the answer to a specific question 
Directive is a command to do something. 

 

 commissIVE: to command, order, or suggest. 
  
  - Directive verbs are used in commands, orders, and suggestions. They are followed by a prepositional phrase that describes where the order or suggestion applies. For example, ""You will find the meeting room on your right."" is an example of a directive verb followed  by a location pre-position.

"
99,"well, now i want to change the date from 24th to 28th.","

the text is considered directive because it is providing the change request to the receiver. Directives are used to request something from another person or entity. 
  
  The sender wants to ask the person about his/her plans for the 28 of December. However, by changing the current date to be 28, it would be a confirmation that the request has already been made.

"
100,"ok, that shall be arranged.","

This text can be interpreted as the person expressing acceptance of the arrangement. This is because the statement ""i  have no  problem with  that."" can also be understood as a negative response to the question ""do you have any problem if I don't show up for the meeting?"". In this case, ""have  no  proble"" can mean ""yes, I have  a  Problem with you not showing up to our meeting.""

"
101,are you busy tomorrow morning?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to request for information or clarification from the listener. The question dialogue Acts are typically used in conversation when the information being conveyed is not immediately obvious or when there is a need for clarification. 
  
In this example, ""are  you busy"" is the question of ""tomorrow morning"". The speaker wants to know if the addressee is currently busy. If the answer is ""yes"", then the conversation will continue as normal. However, if ""no"", the dialogue will end there.

"
102,i'm free. what's up?,"

Question is a dialogue acts that are used to seek information from the other person. In this case, it's likely that the person asking is looking for more information, so the dialogue is classified here. 
  
  Inform is another dialogue Acts that is used for sharing information without any commitment. It's possible that this person is just sharing the fact that China is home to tea without giving further instructions. This is likely the case here as well.

"
103,someone has to pick up the boss at the airport.,"

In the first paragraph, it is mentioned that ""someone"" has the responsibility of picking up ""the boss"" at ""airport."" Based on this, one could argue that this is more of an order than a suggestion. However, in the second paragraph it says that it was the ""sender"" who suggested going out ""again this Friday,"" which could be interpreted as a more suggestion than an command. 
  

A:
According to the GPT-3 model, this message is a question: ""Would you like go again fr Friday?"". The model is not able to determine the exact meaning of the message, but it does predict that there is an element of suggestion in it.

"
104,"oh, i just remembered i've got a report to write.","

""over"" is a qualifier used to describe the relationship between two values. In this case, inform and question are the two possible values, and inform is the larger value. 
  
  ""question"" and ""question, command"" are possible alternatives for the same dialogue acts. ""Question"" has a broader meaning, referring to any type or form of questioning. However, ""command"" specifically refers to a questioning followed by a directive response. The ""comissive"" alternative is not possible in this context, because the verb ""book"" does NOT have a direct object.

"
105,i'm sorry i'm so late. i had a really bad day.,"

Inform: ""i had""
Question: Why ""had"" a bad ""day""?
Directive: Speak to the person who made you late
 commissitive: Complain to them

A:
According to this article, you can use the predict_dialogue_label function in the nltk library to get the label of a given dialogue tag.

"
106,it's ten after six. we're late. but dinner is at six thirty.,"

Overinform: This dialogue acts indicates that information was given that was not requested. In this case, it appears that ""dinner is on time"" was provided. 
Question: It is implied that this is an inquiry, since the question mark is placed before the ""but"" in the second sentence. 
  Question is the most likely dialogueact for this section of text because it indicates a desire for information, and the information provided is contradictory to the desired information. The ""why"" is not included in this question. This is further supported by the fact that there is no ""so"" or ""how"" after the provided information in order to explain how they arrived at the conclusion that dinner was on-time.  
Directive: Directives are used to give orders. Here, ""it is late"" would be a directive to someone to arrive late, whereas ""be ontime"" could be considered a command to another to not be late for dinner. However, in context, this does not appear to fit this definition. It would make more sense to interpret this as a request for clarification, where the listener is expected to know the proper meaning. Therefore, a commissIVE dialogue-act is more likely. A commissitive dialogue is used when someone is asking for a clarification and is expecting a response. For example, if someone were to ask ""what does yellow mean?"", a Commissive dialogue would likely be used, because the person is requesting clarification. If the response is ""slow down"", then the original questioner would know what they don't know. They would then be able to update their understanding and move forward. Whereas, over Commissives would indicate that a clear answer was expected, but was instead provided, indicating that someone was over-clarifying the situation. Since the answer provided was contradictory, there was no need for the clarification request. Instead, they could have simply provided the correct answer. Question is therefore the best fit for these circumstances.

"
107,i know. i know. i'm really sorry. i lost my bag.,"

'i'm sorry' can be an apology or an exclamation. Based on this context, it can't be classified into a specific dialogue category. 
'the bag' could be a subject or object, so it could also be either a direct question or a directive. However, since the bag is lost, we can assume it's a commissIVE dialogue action. 
                                                                  ^

A:
According to your explanation, I think the answer is that ""i lost thebag"" is a request.

"
108,i'll call the lost and found office.,"

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the context suggests that someone is providing information to another person. However, it is also possible that question or directive may be appropriate, depending on who is receiving the information. 
For example:

If the other person is a child, then it may make sense for the person giving information (the parent) to be directive in their tone, to indicate that they are giving instructions. 
  
  If, on  the other hand,  it is an adult giving the advice, and the advisor is giving advice to a younger person, than question may also be a suitable response. In this case, a more directive response would be less appropriate.

"
109,i didn't think of it. thank you. and i do apologize for being late.,"

Overinform: This dialogue action is overinform because the given sentence does not indicate an action to be taken. It is merely stating facts. 
Question: Although the sentence provides information about the office, it does so by providing facts and not by asking questions. Therefore, this is a fact question. 
  
Directive:  The given statement indicates an intent to act, and therefore this action should be performed.  It is not a request for information. The sentence is therefore a directive.   

 commissIVE: Since the statement is an order,  it is commissitive.

"
110,nani book store. how can i help you?,"

Mike is asking K. about how he can help her. This is a typical question in a conversation. 
  
  Based off the surrounding text it appears that Mike is trying to convince K to do something. He is giving her advice and asking for her help.

"
111,do you have the'the man and the sea'by ernest hemingway?,"

Question is characteristic that the questioner is looking for information from another person. In this case, 'the man' is asking 'where is the man from' and'seas' are asking for the location of the'man and sea'. 
  
In contrast, inform is used when someone is providing general information, for example, ""the weather is going to be nice today"". 
 Directive is when one person gives instructions to another, such as ""take out the trash"". 
Commissives are when two or more people make a joint commitment, as in ""we are going for a walk tomorrow"".

"
112,"yes, we have one copy left.","

Because the dialogue acts of the statement are overinform,question,directive,commissive. The inform dialogue is only used when the information provided is not relevant to the question asked.

"
113,can you hold it for me?,"

This text suggests the person offering the service is giving directions or offers to help. The offer is free and the recipient is expected to do something with it. 
  
  This is a good example of how dialogue acts can be used to determine the nature of the interaction. In this case, it is clear that this is an offering of help, and not a request for help (which would be question). 
   
In addition, this dialogue is also marked as direct, suggesting that it was the direct offer of assistance that prompted the response.

"
114,do you have maps of downtown area?,"

This text is a question about whether the person has any maps or not. Based on this, it is classified under question. 
  
If the answer is yes, then the dialogue acts changes to directive. If the answerer says no, than the question changes into inform.

"
115,"yes, here you are.","

In this example, ""how it started"" is a question. Based on this, a commissIVE response is predicted. 
  The speaker wants to know how the situation started.

"
116,how much is it?,"

This text provided specific details about a cost, and therefore it may be considered a request for information. This is because it does ask for specific facts, but does so in a way that does NOT reveal the actual facts. In this case, it provided the total cost without revealing that cost. Therefore, this is considered to likely be a query. 
  
On the other hand, if the person asking the question was not expecting a specific answer, then they may not have been able to process the information in the way it was provided, leading to a commissIVE response.

"
117,it's free of charge.,"

Overinform: This dialogueact indicates the questioner is over-interpreting the situation. The question is not really a request for information, but rather a statement of the asker's opinion. 
Question: the person asking the questions is clearly seeking confirmation or clarification. 
  The question itself is a form of request, and the answer is confirmation of what the inquirer is already aware of.  

A:
According to the Stanford Corenlp natural language processing toolkit, there are 4 possible answers for the given text: 

 

""yes""
  ""no"" 
 ""it is free""

"
118,thanks so much.,"

This text seems to suggest that there has indeed been an error, and the speakers are providing further information to help the listener understand the situation. Dialogue acts of question and directive are typically used for asking questions, while directive and commissives are used to make promises. Inform is the correct dialogue action for providing this kind of information.

"
119,"hi there, i want to reserve a hotel room.","

Directive dialogue acts are used to influence or prompt a response from the other person. In this case, it seems like the person is trying to choose a particular hotel over another. 
  

Inform: This is a question that the dialogue partner can answer. The person asking the question is likely the one who is interested in the hotel, so they should be the first to know if there is availability. 
Question: Is there availability?
Answer: There is some availability, but it is not in this city. We can reserve another hotel in another city if this one does not work for you.  The person who asked for a room should choose the option that works best for them. They should also let the owner know.   
Guiding:  This is the least likely dialogue action in my model. I would be more likely to predict a command or request. However, based on this example, I believe the action is guiding.

"
120,"no problem at all. could i have your full name, please?","

Directives are used when the person speaking is seeking information or assistance from another person. In this case, it appears that ""you"" are the other person, so the directive act would be used. 
  
Out of the four options, only question and directive are possible for this act. Directive is the most likely, as the question mark at end of sentence indicates the ""question"" is being asked by the character ""You"". 
   

A:
According to the dialogue acts defined by MIT, your answer is correct.

"
121,"sure, john sandals.","

This text is asking for the gas price to lowered, and the person speaking is instruct the listener to take action.

"
122,"hi, mr. sandals. i'm michelle, at your service. when do you need the room?","

Because the dialogue acts are classified based on their main function, Michelle is asking if the guest needs assistance. This requires the response of the visitor to accept the help offered or to decline it.

"
123,my plans are to be there april 14th to the 17th.,"

In the context of the provided text the inform act applies. The speaker (the one asking the question) is providing information about the date and the location of when the action will take place. 
  

overinform: the information is too general and does not provide enough details about when and where the activity will happen. 
question: this is a good start, but the details are not enough to make a decision. For example, it is not clear if the person asking will be present at the specified date or not. If the asker is going to attend, then the plan needs to include the means to transport the materials to and from the developing location. But if he/she is unable to come, for example because of weather, than the request needs modification. Also, there is no mention of whether the equipment needed for developing the film will also be available at that location or if they will need to purchased there.  If the latter, this would need also to take into account the time it will takes to get the items and prepare the room for the development. In short, a more detailed question would be: ""What is the availability of equipment and space at this location to perform the requested action?"". And this question is still not answered.


directive: based on this information, I will plan my trip to visit this developing place on April 14 - 17. I am asking you to confirm this date for me. Please note that I expect you will do this for my benefit. Directives are used when someone is requesting something from another person or an entity, and is expecting a certain action from them. It is important to note the difference between directives and orders. An order is an instruction to someone or something to carry out a task. A directive is when a person is making a request of another, expecting that person to fulfill their request. When a customer asks a salesperson for a quote, that is most likely a order, however, when that same customer makes a similar request to another sales person, asking for confirmation of a date when they can expect a quotation, they are likely making an inquiry, or asking a question. While both orders and inquiries are requests for information or a response from a third party, directives are only used by the one who is issuing the directive to request a reply from that third person. So, in this case, based off of my request, you are expected to reply with a confirmation for when you can develop my roll. Note that this confirmation does NOT guarantee that your quote will include a development fee. You will still need the customer to pay that fee themselves. However, if you confirm that you cannot develop the image until April 17, we can cancel the order and not charge the client for development fees. On the other hand, should you agree to develop it on that date, your quotation will now include this service and you do not need any additional fees to complete the job. Finally, note also that in some cases, especially in the legal field, directives can also imply an order. That is, an explicit order to a party to act in a way or perform a function. Therefore, depending on context, these two acts can have different legal implications. 


commissive (or commissivo): I would like to point out that there are some issues with this request that need addressing. First, as I mentioned before, no one has confirmed that they have equipment available to process the images at your location on those dates. Second, even if we were able to accommodate your request for April 16th, 17 we have a wedding on either April 15th or 16 that we need your help for. We would appreciate it if someone could help us with the processing of these images on these dates, so that our photographer can take photos for our wedding. Third, while we are happy to help you develop these films, our normal processing fee is $50 per roll, regardless of how many images are in them, since we do have to purchase the chemicals and other equipment to prepare these rolls. Fourth, given that these are wedding photos, some of which are very important, such as the bride and groom, their parents, bridal party and groomsmen, etc., we would prefer not to have these processed at any location other than a lab that has experience in developing these types of photos. Given that, unfortunately, none of our local labs are able or willing to assist you, please understand that if I do confirm my presence on 16 and 17 you should cancel this order for processing and refund the $150 deposit. Should you not cancel my order by 17 I can still proceed with my plans to travel to your facility on 14 April, provided that my travel arrangements are made by April 13th at which time I should be able receive a refund of $100 from your bank account. Again, all of that assumes that no equipment or chemicals are unavailable on any of those days. Lastly, let me point that while I understand your desire to provide this assistance, my company does have other clients that are waiting for their images to processed, who are willing and able pay the normal $500 processing fees for these photos and I cannot accommodate all requests. Thank you for your understanding and please let us know if there will ever be a time that a processing request can wait. Sincerely, Customer

"
124,"we have new room rates, sir. will that be acceptable to you?","

Directives are used to make requests of others. In this case, it is the hotel that is being requested to accept a rate increase. 
Inform is used when someone is expressing gratitude. The hotel is thanked for its recommendation and the rate is not a problem. 
  
Question is a way to get information from another person. This is because the next sentence does ask for information, so the answer to the question must be in the subsequent text. However, there is no subsequent information in this example. Therefore, inform is more appropriate.

"
125,"well, it depends on the price, of course. what is it?","

Compressed tea is tea that has had its liquid content squeezed out of it. It is typically served cold. 
  OulONG tea on contrast is served hot, but is also compressed. The liquid is boiled out.

"
126,it's $ 308 a night.,"

This text is considered to be directive as the person is asking you to do something, i.e. wait. 
Over inform: the information is not particularly useful, it's just a number. 
  Question: who is this number for? 
      Directive: please pay the $308.00.  
      Commissive (also called imperative): I want you pay $30.08.

"
127,i have no problem with that.,"

I have classified the dialogueact as question because the use "" why"" in the given text indicates the question of why the specific person was pulledover.

"
128,great! would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking?,"

""Would you rather smoke or not?"" contains the word ""rather"" which is used to indicate a preference. This is an interrogatory structure, and indicates a request for a response. 
On the other hand, ""What are they?,"" is asking for information. ""They"" could be a pronoun referring to something or someone, or it could represent a plural noun. In this case, it would be an adjective describing something.

"
129,definitely nonsmoking. i can't handle that smell.,"

inform: This is information seeking, and the speaker is looking for the
  recipient's opinion or response. 
question: this is an attempt to gather more information. The
   speaker is interested in the answer to a yes/no question. 
  directive: the directive dialogue acts are used when the message is
     telling someone what to do. Commissive dialogue Acts are only used
    when the relationship is not friendly. In this case, it's not a good
       idea to be telling the other person what they want to hear.

"
130,"nonsmoking. now, is a queen - size bed okay?","

""nondrinking"" is not mentioned in the passage. Therefore, this is an overinform text. 
Queen-size beds are not the only type of bed. So, it is unclear what the questioner is looking for. It is possible that she is just looking to confirm that a bed is available, but it could also be that there is another aspect to the request that is missing from the provided information. 
  

Smoking: This is mentioned as a possible factor in determining the bed size. However, there isn't enough information provided to determine whether the smoker is present or not. The question is therefore a directive question rather than a commissIVE question: ""is a nondrinkinq queen-sized bed ok?""

"
131,no problem.,"

This text is commissively acting, because it gives a command or order. Commands and orders are typically commissives.

"
132,"great, mr. sandals. your reservation is confirmed. now all i need is your phone number.","

Mr. Sandals is providing the phone numbers of both the person who is booking the hotel room and the driver. This is a directive message, as it is intended to be acted upon.

"
133,of course! it's area code 626 - 555 - 1739.,"

 commissives are often seeking information or clarifications from others, so it is likely that the author of the message is a person. 
In this case, it appears that person is asking ""ofcourse!"", which is an informal way of expressing agreement.

"
134,"thank you so much, mr. sandals. we look forward to seeing you!","

Inform (Over Question, Directive, Commissive) is used when the information provided is not a request for information, a direct order, nor a commitment. Instead, it is an explanation or a report. 
  
  - Explanation: ""I have such a headache, that I can't see straight.""
- Report:  ""I am reporting for work today, as I have been feeling under the weather.""

"
135,"could i have my bill, please?","

This text indicates the person is giving directions or instructions on something they want. 
In this case, they would like their bill. 
  
  The text ""i will use"" indicates that they plan on doing something, which is the giving of instructions. The verbs ""use"" and ""plan"" both indicate that someone is thinking about or planning something. This text is therefore align with giving direction or instruction.

"
136,"certainly, sir.","

This text is asking for information. The text states that it is a ""hot potato"". This implies that someone is going to take this item from the speaker and the person asking the question is trying to prevent this. This text could be asking someone to stop taking the item, so the answer could simply be to return the object to the owner.

"
137,i'm afraid there's been a mistake.,"

Inform is used to provide basic information without asking a follow-up question or providing a directive or commissIVE response. 
  
Question is the first person singular form of the verb to question and is typically used for a direct, open-ended question that seeks clarification. 
Directive is often used in place of command or order. For example, ""Tell the children to stop playing in the street"" is directive whereas ""Command the child to play in their street,"" ""Order the Child to Play in Their Street"" and ""Give the order to the Children to Stop Playing in The Street.""
Commissive can be used when you are asking someone to do something but you don't want them to answer back. ""Please pass the salt"" would be commissitive whereas if you wanted the person to respond, you would use directive.

"
138,"i'm sorry, sir. what seems to be the trouble?","

Question is a dialogueact that is used to ask for information or clarification. The sentence 'the dialogue Act of the above text is classified question' is asking for a reason why this particular dialogue action is considered a 'question'.

In this case, 'it seems that what you are saying is not quite right' fits the definition of a clarification request.

"
139,"i believe you have charged me twice for the same thing. look, the figure of 6. 5 dollar appears here, then again here.","

I believe the second time you charged for a figure that is already included in the first charge.

"
140,"i'll just go and check it for you, sir.","

Out of question: the taxi driver is on a strike, so I will just check for him. 
Over question (or over question): I'll go check with the driver and get back to you. 
  The text does ask for a response. The response is a confirmation that the speaker will check the information provided.

"
141,"good evening, madam. can i help you?","

Question is a dialogue acts that are typically used to ask a direct question. In this case, ""question"" is used as a verb to describe the way the information is being provided. ""Question"" can also be used in a sentence to mean ""to ask an indirect question"". The information provided by the speaker is clearly not a ""direct question"" because it is stating facts and not seeking an answer. Therefore, it was classified here as ""quest"" (question, indirect). 
  
Overinform: This is the verb form of the adjective ""overly"" which means ""excessive"". Inform is overinform. 
 Question:  This is another verb meaning to provide information in such a way that it does not allow for a clear answer, and is typically followed by a statement of uncertainty. This text uses question to characterize the manner in which the provided information was provided, not as an actual question itself.  The text does provide a definite answer to the question of whether the listener has a physical symptom of flu, so it can be classified under question here.

"
142,yes. i bought this sheet here yesterday.,"

the text is classified inform rather than question or directive
because the writer is telling the reader that they have just bought the sheet, and inform is the most appropriate dialogueact for this situation

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue for screen and film"" by Johnathan Blythe, there are 4 possible dialogue acts: 
Inform: ""I bought [item] yesterday.""
Question:  ""Where is [location]?""
Directive:   ""You must do that tomorrow.""  (This is a strong order.)
Commissive : ""You should not do this.""   (This person is being disobedient.)  

It is important to note that these acts are not mutually exclusive. For example, a question and directive act can occur together.     
If you are given a choice between two options, you may choose to do either one or the other. However, if you have no choice, then you will choose between the two. In this case, it is likely that you would choose the first option that is available to you. So, in this example you might choose ""to do"" the option you were given.

"
143,anything wrong with it?,"

""The text does provide information. However, there is no question in it. The writer is sharing information.""

"
144,"yes. when i spread it out back home, i found this hole.","

Inform (or informative) is a conversation act that describes information being provided to someone. 
  
  - Out ofinform, a request for information is provided. 
- Question: Is the information correct?
 - Directive: Do this; don't do that. Do it!
   - Commissive (sometimes called ""commissive""): I want you to do it this way.  Do it my way!  I want to be the one to decide what to  do.

"
145,"oh, how awful! may i have a look at the invoice?","

Directive is the most likely dialogue acts for this section of text because ""how awful!"" can also be used to request a favor or to give orders. 
  
Question is unlikely as the speaker is seeking clarification or confirmation from the addressee. 
Out ofinform is also unlikely because this is a statement of fact, not a request for a favour or an order.

"
146,here it is.,"

This text is giving information on a previously discussed topic. 
It is a concluding statement, so it does not fit into the question or command categories.

"
147,"well. please accept our sincere apologies, i'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish.","

In this example, based on only the first sentence of the message, it is not possible to determine the dialogueact. However, looking at the second sentence, we can see that there is a request for a correction, so the correct classification is commissIVE.

"
148,that's very kind of you. thank you.,"

""The text provided information that was not a request, a
command, nor a guarantee. The information was merely sharing, and
thus the response was classified under the commissIVE dialogue
act.""

"
149,"we're sorry that this has happened, and i guarantee that the same mistake won't happen again.","

This text is asking for information from its recipient. This is an indication that it is likely a questions dialogue acts. 
In addition, it uses the word ""guarantee"" which indicates that a request for assurance is being made.

"
150,i need to buy some flowers for my wife.,"

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that express a command, order, or suggestion. 
Out of directive:

Question: Is it ok if I buy the flowers?
Command: Buy the flower!
Order: Please buy flowers! 

 

Inform: is it Ok if i buy you flowers?
Overinform: please buy me flowers

"
151,perhaps you'd be interested in red roses.,"

This text indicates the requestor is directing the server to get red rose for the requested bill. 
  
  This is an instruction, not a mere request for information.

"
152,what would the roses cost me?,"

Question: is a request for information or a clarification. The question is asking for an estimate of the cost of flowers. 
  
Overinform: This dialogue action is used when the information provided is not enough to make an appropriate decision. For example, a person might overinform to a second party about a situation in order to avoid upsetting them. 
Q: How much would it cost? 

 

Inform: Inform is the first dialogue activity in a conversation. An informer is someone who provides information to another party. In this case, KARA is informing Mike of her identity

"
153,they're only $ 20 a dozen.,"

$ 20 is a lot of money for a few dozen t-shirts. The recipient of the message may not be able to afford them, so the sender is asking for help in getting the money to the intended recipient. 
It's unclear if the tshirts are still available. If they are not available, then the receiver may be unable to purchase them and the request may become a directive to return the shirts if they still exist.

"
154,i like the sound of that.,"

overinform: the response should mention that both types are teasts, but instead mention only one of them. 
question: this response is not a direct answer to the question asked, and instead provides additional information. 
  

I like oolong teast better than compressed teat.  

"
155,"yes, that is today's sale price.","

overinform: This dialogueact is used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision. 
question: this is the most common dialogue acts used in a conversation. It is also used to seek information or clarify something that was not clear before. 
  In this case, it seems that the question is about something the customer said, and the response is providing the answer.  
directive: when you want to tell someone what to do. In this example, you are asking the buyer if they would like the item at the current sale. The buyer is then free to accept or reject the offer. However, this dialogue is more likely used for a one-time conversation than for an ongoing conversation, so it's not the best choice for this type of conversation
commissive : this means to punish or to hurt. Here, we can see that a buyer rejected an offer, but the seller is still trying hard to convince them to buy the product. We can assume that this kind of dialogue would be more common in an argument than in conversation

"
156,a dozen will be fine.,"

In the first instance, where the amount of money appears, it is 6 dollars. 
However, in the second instance it appears as if the exact amount has doubled, which is 5 dollars, hence the directive label.

"
157,is there anything else you'd like to get?,"

Question is a sub-class of directive. Question can be used to ask a direct question. For example, ""why did you do that?"" can also be considered a directive question if the addressee is expected to provide a reason. However, if you were to use the question label for this example text (which is not a recommendation), it would be incorrect. The text is clearly providing the information that you did that because you are going to next week's party. Therefore, it should be classified under the label ofinform.

"
158,"no, thank you.","

inform: tells the person being interviewed what is being asked of them
question: asks the interviewee a clarifying question
directive: gives a clear order or request
commISSIVE: makes a promise or commitment

In summary, inform is the most likely dialogue action in this context, because the message is requesting information from the interview subject.

"
159,these roses should make your wife very happy.,"

inform: This is not a request for information, but rather a statement of fact. The sender is simply stating that there are roses available to make the receiver happy
question: this is the most likely dialogueact, since the sender seeks the information of the recipients needs/preferences
directive: the message is requesting a service from recipient
commissive (or request): the request is for a specific service

Note that this classification is based on a limited sample of text and may not be 100% accurate.

"
160,"room service, is there anything i can do for you?","

Question is the correct classification because the speaker is looking for an explanation or confirmation. The speaker wants to make sure the person they are speaking to understands what they have asked. 
  
Out ofinform: the question is too general and does not provide enough information to be answered. 
question: this is a general question that does provide information but is not specific enough to provide a definitive answer.  The question does give enough context to understand what the asker is trying to accomplish, but does little to help the listener answer the specific question asked
out inform: here the informer (the person asking the general questions) is giving too much information, providing too many details that are not necessary to the answer being sought. Informers should be more concise in their communication.

"
161,"yes, i am afraid there are not enough outlets.","

In the first sentence, ""Grateful"" the writer is expressing gratitude. 
""I didn’t think"" indicates the author is not sure of the idea. 
  ""thank you"" is an expression of gratitude, so the second sentence is also an example of expressing gratefulness.  
Then in the third sentence the word ""apology"" suggests the Author is offering an explanation.

"
162,"well, we have 6 for each room.","

Overinform: the information provided is too much. It is not necessary for the person to know this information. 
Question: is the sender asking the recipient a specific question? If so, is it a yes/no question or a request for additional information?
Directive: does the message contain a directive? A command or order for someone to do something. 
 Commissive : is this a conversation where one person is making promises or commitments to another? 
  
In this case, inform is appropriate. The speaker acknowledges that they lost their luggage and expresses their regret. This is information that the receiver would expect the owner of the luggage to have.

"
163,"yes, but 4 of them are broken. can you send someone here?","

Directive is the most likely dialogueact given the context. The speaker is asking the recipient to do something, and the request is very specific. 
  

A:
According to the model, this is a directive text.

"
164,"ok sir, please wait a minute.","

 commissives are used to express strong opinions or commands. In this case, it's likely that the speaker is expressing an order to the listener to go to a certain location and enjoy a coffee.

"
165,why'd you pull me over?,"

""why"" is a question word. It is used to ask for a reason or a motivation. In this case, it is asking ""why did you stop me?"". The word ""you"" in this sentence is the third person pronoun, which is an indirect form of communication. Indirect communication is when the message is sent from one person to another, but the second person is not directly involved in speaking the sentence. This is why the ""You"" pronoun is being used here. 
  
  The ""pulled me"" part of the phrase is also a command. A command is usually used when a person or an animal is ordered to do something. ""Pulled"" here is another indirect communication word, where the command comes from the driver of a car. He is telling the police officer to ""stop me"". 
   
   The word"" over"" indicates that the next word is followed by a counter statement, in which case the previous statement is ""questioning"" or ""asking for clarification"". The next statement in question form is: ""Why did yuo pull m over?""

A:
According to the Stanford dialogue system, this is question: 
question(why, did, you, pull, m, over, stop, me, why?)

"
166,are you aware that you drove through a red light?,"

""Are youaware thatyou drove throughthe redlight?"" is a question asking the listener if they are aware of something. The question is followed by the response ""yes"" or ""no."" This is an example of asking a ""wh-question"" which indicates that the questioner is formulating a statement to which the answer is ""true or false."" 
  

In this case, ""are"" and ""you"" are the subject and verb of the wh- question. 
   
   The ""Are"" part of areaware is the interrogative pronoun, indicating that ""You"" (the subject of awareness) is being questioned.  The wordaware also indicates knowledge or awareness. Therefore, based on this context, it is likely that  the listener is aware (or knows) that they were driving through the red traffic light.

   ""You,"" the object of  ""areaware,"" is also likely to be aware. ""Your"" meaning ""yourself"" indicates a personal awareness, as opposed to an awareness of a general or general type. In this example,  it is clear that this person is driving and is therefore aware they drove the car through  a red  light.
Are  you aware  that you  drove throughthe red   light?  is a yes or no question followed  by the  listener's response. Based on  this context  and the dialogue  act of question  (over  inform,   question,    directive,     commissive),  we can predict that   the  dialogue act will be  question.   

  

"
167,i ran a red light?,"

Question is a sub-type ofinform. Question is used to seek information from another person or entity. In this case, it is likely that question is being used by the writer to solicit a reply from you. 
  
Out of question: I did not know that there were several types of tea in China. I will look into this. 
Inform: This is information that is not directed at a particular person, but is generally understood by all parties involved. The writer is informing the reader that they are aware that several varieties of teas exist in china.

"
168,"yes, you did.","

Inform is used when the message is about current or recent events, and the author is sharing information to help the reader or listener respond appropriately. Inform messages are not asking questions or giving advice. They are simply reporting on what has happened. 
  
Question is a question asking question. It is the first dialogue action in the conversation. 
Directive is asking someone to do something. For example, ""Call your mom.""
 commissitive is giving orders. ""Go to the store and get milk."" 

 

A:

This is an example of Informativeness.  The author of the document is not seeking advice, but rather sharing current information.

"
169,"i apologize, but i didn't realize that i did.","

Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both subclasses of the more general class inform. Therefore, inform is the most likely classification for this dialogue action. 
Question: question is a subclass of question. However, this classification is less certain than inform because the surrounding text does not indicate that this is an instruction or request for a response. 
  Instead, it is more likely that question was intended to be a reply to a previous question in the conversation. In this case, there is no indication that it was meant to function as an informational request.

"
170,"weren't you taught that yellow means slow down, not speed up?","

This text uses the word ""werent"" to introduce a new topic, indicating that it's a statement rather than a direct question. 
  
""Weren’t you told that..."" is an example of a ""subjunctive"" form of the verb ""to be"". This means that ""you were not told..."" instead of "" you were told..."". Subjunctives are used to express uncertainty, and are often used in legal documents. In this case, it means ""it might be the case that you weren't told [that tea speeds up]"". 
   
Yellow tea is typically served iced, so the implication is that someone told you that tea that is yellow speeds things up. If the person had no knowledge of yellow tea speeding things along, they would have said ""werent you Told that Yellow tea speed things [up]?"".

"
171,i did learn that.,"

'i didn’t realize' can indicate that the information provided is new to the listener. In this case, it is the first time the user is apologizing. Therefore, 'I didn' realize I did' could be an example of 'outof inform'.

A:
According to this article, ""out"" is a good guess for this kind of text.

"
172,"so, then why did you speed up?","

When you use the fastText model to classify a text as a query, it will try to find the most similar text in its model and use it as the prediction. In this case, since the query text is ""ok, next"", the model found this blog post which contains the word ""next"" and used it to make the classification. Since the blog is about the next facebook, this is what the dialogue acts of ""the next Facebook"" would be.

"
173,i don't know what to tell you.,"

inform: the sender is providing information, but does not request a response
question: there is a question in the receiver's mind, so the message is not a simple ""yes"" or ""no""
directive: a command is given, with a time limit
 commissIVE: this is the final step of a process, where the other party has the option to accept or reject the command

A:
According to your explanation, you can say that this message contains both inform and directive elements. The inform element is related to the suggestion of rest, while the directive element indicates that a written prescription is going to be given.

"
174,i'm going to have to write you a ticket.,"

Surely is a statement that can also be an adjective describing something (e.g. surely beautiful). ""Of course"", when used as a confirmation, can only be used after a verb (i.e., ""of course you should do it"").

A:
According to the Stanford Core Dialogue Acts Model, surely can mean ""certainly"" or ""absolutely"".
""Surelys"" ofcourse"" is an example of surely meaning ""Absolutely"".

"
175,i understand.,"

the given expression is of an apology and not a statement of fact;
it does convey some information, namely that ""this mistake will probably not happen in future"", which is why the classification asinform is justified.

"
176,here you go. don't do that again.,"

Directive is a special kind of question asking someone to do something. In this case, it's likely the question is meant to elicit a response from the user. The user is being asked to provide the price for something - so it would make sense that the request would be classified here.

"
177,can i have the roll of film developed here?,"

Directive is the only one of the five possible labels for this dialogueact that is not mentioned in the example response. The example text provides the information that the film was developed in a local lab, so the request can be answered with a yes or no. This is an example of a directive dialogue Act.

"
178,surely of course.,"

This text is a confirmation of something the other person said. This is because it is an informational response that confirms something that was previously provided. 
  The text ""yes, yes you keep your things for three days"" is the confirmation that the person asked about keeping things.

"
179,here is the film. can i get my pictures tomorrow?,"

Directive is used to ask for something to be done. In this case, it's asking for the pictures to get returned. 
Question is another way of asking a clarifying question. Here, 'the pictures' is unclear, so the question is asked to clarify the meaning of 'pictures'.
Out ofinform is an interrogative word used in this context to indicate uncertainty. 'What about' indicates the speakers are seeking clarification. 
  

A:
According to the dialogue classification, this is directive.  The text asks for a clarification, which is also a directive act.

"
180,sure.,"

 commissives are used when the speaker is trying to get the other person to do something. For example, if I ask you to pass the salt, I'm trying get you pass it to me so I can take a bite. 
  
Out of the four dialogue acts, Commissive is the most common. It is used in requests, commands, and orders.

"
181,besides i want two copies of all the photos.,"

This text is offering to help the person who is asking for two sets of photos, so it seems like a command or request would be appropriate. However, it's a question so the response would need to include the information that two is the minimum number of copies.

"
182,"tell me a little bit about yourself, please.","

Mike is not asking K. a ""little bit"" about herself. He is giving her information. 
He is also not telling her about himself. Rather, he is simply introducing her to a third party.

"
183,my name is dunlin and i live in beijing. i was born in 1980. i will graduate from peking university this july. i have majored in accounting.,"

In this example, it is clear that the author is attempting to influence the reader's choice by providing an alternate option. The author has provided the alternative choice to the intended recipient, and therefore the dialogue acts are leaning towards directive.

"
184,would you tell me something about your family?,"

""directive"" is a common label for this act, as it is used to describe a person who is asking another person to do something. In this case, it seems like the person is telling me about her family, so this is another example of directive. 
However, ""direct"" can also mean ""push"" or ""force"", which are actions that are less likely to be used in this context. 
  

A:
According to the definition of Dialogue Act in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_act,
Directive: A directive dialogue acts are used when the dialogue partner is being asked to take an action. The action may be a simple request for assistance or a more complex request to carry out a plan. For example, a police officer directing a suspect to drop a weapon or an employer asking an employee to fill out an application.

"
185,"there are three in my family, my parents and myself. my father is a teacher and my mother is a worker.","

My father, a person of authority, is asking my mom to take a specific action, namely, to ask the gas station owner to decrease the pump price. My father's use of directive here indicates he is requesting mymom to carry out an action that is within her authority and responsibility. 
  
  In contrast, if myfather were to say, ""ask the station manager to increase the prices of gas,"" then mymother would be acting in her capacity as a manager and not as parent, and he would not be requesting her to act in a parent-like capacity.

"
186,i really need to start eating healthier.,"

Out of question and directive there is no indication that the information provided is being requested or being given. Therefore, it is classified here as out of these four dialogue acts. 
There is also no commissives in this context, so it cannot be categorized as commissIVE. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I can understand that this is an informative dialogue.

"
187,i have to start eating better too.,"

inform: This is a good start, but it does not provide enough information to make a decision. The writer should provide more details, such as how much weight the person should lose, what kind of diet they should follow, and so on. 
question: Is this a test? If so, it's not very well written. If it isn't a testing situation, then the writer needs to provide context, for example, ""you have been feeling underweight lately"". 

 

directive: Don't eat that. You will gain weight. 
  

commissive : Don’t do it. Don”t eat the cake.

"
188,what kind of food do you usually eat?,"

Question: the dialogue acts of ""the kind you usual food"" are question. ""you usually"" is a declarative statement, so the question mark is used to ask a follow-up question: ""what do I usually?"". 
  
Inform: although the first statement is declaratively stated, it is still an informational statement:  ""the food you eat"" contains information about the kind, which is usually chicken.  So the inform act has taken place.

"
189,"i try my best to eat only fruits, vegetables, and chicken.","

Overinform: This is a polite request for more information, but the addressee is declining the offer. 
Question: Is this a suggestion or an order? 

 

Directive: Tell me more about why you don't want this. 


 
  

 commissIVE: I prefer not to.

 
   
I try to avoid chicken and fruits. I'm allergic to them.

"
190,is that really all that you eat?,"

Question: yes, that is all we eat. 
Information: no, we do not eat all of what we purchase. We eat a healthy diet that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy. 
  We also enjoy occasional meals of red meat, chicken, fish, shellfish, eggs, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables.

"
191,that's basically it.,"

Well,  we have  6 for  each room. 
  This indicates sharing  details or  giving an  update.

"
192,how do you stick to only those foods?,"

Question is used to express uncertainty, such as ""I don't know"" or ""Can I have that?"". 
In this case, ""can I eat that"" is an example of uncertainty. The speaker is not sure if the listener can eat the food, so they are asking the question. 
  
Directive is another way of expressing certainty, or a command. ""Eat that!"" is the example for directive communication.

"
193,"actually, fruits and veggies are really good for you.","

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the message is providing useful information to the reader. The sender is suggesting that the recipient take a fruit or vegetable in two weeks, so the information provided is useful.

"
194,"yeah, i know, but what about the chicken?","

Mike is being questioned about his plans to leave the house. 
  The text does not provide any instructions or orders, instead it is sharing the thoughts of the person who is going to be leaving the home, and providing Mike with information to help him prepare for his move.

"
195,"i mainly eat baked chicken, because there's not a lot of fat.","

Out of question: the statement does not ask a direct question. 
Question: there is no question in the provided text. 
  The statement is a fact, not asking for confirmation or explanation.  
Directive: this is not the expected dialogue action for a statement of preference. The expected action is to express a preference and then listen for the other person's preference in a dialogue. In this case, there isn't a directive action, as the preference is just shared.   
 commissIVE: This is the least likely dialogueact, since the person sharing the information is likely to be the one expressing a desire for more information.

"
196,that does sound pretty good.,"

Inform: This is the most common dialogueact in this type of conversation. Inform acts as a bridge between two parties and provides them with basic information about each other. 
  
Question: In this example, inform is not the right dialogue action, because the statement ""can Ihelp you"" is asking a question. A question is typically followed by a response. 
Directive: ""yes, please help me"" sounds like the person is offering help. Directives are typically used when one person needs to make an action on behalf of another person. For example:  ""I need you to call the car rental company and cancel my car. They are going to think I don't care about their business if I do not ask for it."" 
 Commissive : This dialogue acts is used to express requests for something that is owed to someone. ""Can I have some water?"" is an example of commissives.

"
197,"i know it does, and that's because it is.","

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the response provides a reassurance or confirmation of a prior statement. The response does neither ask for confirmation, nor does it make any commitment or directive.

"
198,good afternoon! can i help you?,"

Question is used to request information from the listener. The speaker is asking for help in completing a task. 
  Based off the context, it is likely that the dialogue acts of 'help' and 'hold it' are commissives. 'Help' is a common word to describe the act to help someone. And 'Hold it?' is an imperative form of asking someone for an item. This text is therefore likely to have a question dialogueact of help and a commissIVE dialogueAct of holdit.

"
199,could you show me where the chinesc - style clothing is located? i want to buy a silk coat.,"

Directive is a directive dialogue acting form that is used when the
  speaker is asking the listener to take an action. For example, a
person might be asked to ""go to the store and buy milk"". In this
situation, direct speech is followed by a direct object, which is the item
the listener is to purchase.

"
200,"this way, please. here they are. they're all handmade.","

Because the given statement is an acknowledgement of expertise, not a question. 
Question: ""you sure know alot about Chinese Tea""
Inform: Yes, I do. 
  Question : ""how come you know so much about it?""
Directive: I don't know how I know, but I sure do!

"
201,"oh, they look nice. may i try that black one on?","

""may itry thatblack oneon"" is a directive sentence. A directive statement is one that conveys a command, order, request, suggestion, etc. The word ""try"" in this sentence is the command or order. 
  
  The sentence also contains a request or suggestion. ""Black one"" refers to a type of car. Black cars are nice, so the speaker is asking the listener to try one.

"
202,of course. the fitting room is right over there.,"

 commissives are often used when someone is being asked to do something, and they are not in a position to provide direction or information. For example, a salesperson might be asked for a recommendation for an online shopping site, but they do not have sufficient knowledge to give an informed recommendation. In this case, they would be asking for information, so they fall into the commissIVE category.

"
203,do you have a medium in the same color? this one is a little tight.,"

This text seems to indicate that the asker is seeking clarification. The askers are looking for a ""medium in same colour"" and the response ""this one's a bit tight"" could be interpreted as a confirmation that it is indeed a tight one.

"
204,l'm sorry. all the black of that size are sold out. would you like a red one?,"

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to request or order something from someone. In this case, it is used as a request for a different size of the same fruit. 
Overinform is another special kind of classification for dialogue Acts that indicates that the information provided is too much or too little. This is not an appropriate classification in this context. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think that you are right. Directive seems to be the right classification.

"
205,ok. let me try it on. what do you think?,"

Question is a directive act, as the context suggests that Sven is directing the conversation and asking a question. 
Inform is not applicable, since the dialogue is about a meeting and not about Svens personal opinion. 
   
Out of question: question is commissIVE, which is out of the scope of direct questions.

"
206,"oh, that suits you very well. besides it is believed in china that the red color brings happiness and good luck.","

""it isbelieved inchina"" is not revealed in this dialogue. So, it can still be consider as ""itis believed"" as the source is unknown. 
Besides, this is a general statement about belief, so it does not contain any question or command. It is just a statement of fact.

"
207,really? i'ii take it and i'm leaving here tomorrow. is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you get it in?,"

Question is a dialogue-act type that is used to express a request for information. The question mark at the end of a sentence is an indicator that a speech act may contain a query. In this case, ""is it possbile for u to send one black one to m when u get is in?"" is considered a ""question"" because it contains a clause that can be interpreted as a statement of fact. 
  
  Inform is the first dialogue action in a text. This is typically used for providing information to a listener. ""Thank you for your message. We look fwd to hearing from you soon."" Inform can also be used as an introductory statement, such as ""It is my pleasure to meet with you today."" 
   
Directive is another dialogue type used when giving orders. Here, you can see the person giving the order is also taking steps to carry out the instructions. For example, in ""Please return the file to the drop-off point by 3:00 p.m."", the speaker is telling the listener what to do. Commisive, on occasion, is given to someone who is taking action but is not directly involved in the action. An example of that would be ""I'm happy to help you with your bags, but I don't have any bags of my own.""

A:
According to this article, your prediction is correct.

"
208,"our pleasure. please fill out this form, leaving your address and telephone number.","

Our pleasure, please complete this simple form and leave your telephone and address.

"
209,thanks. how much would that come to?,"

Inform: This is not a request for confirmation, but rather a statement of fact. 
Question: the informative dialogue acts are not sufficient to classify this as a direct request. The question mark indicates a desire for more information. 
  
Directive: this is a directive dialogue action, indicating that a command or order is being given.  The use of ""you"" indicates the directive is intended for the addressee.   
Commissive/Commands:  this is commissitive, meaning that someone is giving orders or making a demand.

"
210,let me see...,"

In the first sentence, Gratitude is expressed, followed by an offer of an
apology. This indicates the information is being provided. 
  There is nothing in this sentence that indicates a question is asked or a command given. Therefore, inform is the correct classification.

"
211,how are you today?,"

Question: This text is asking me a direct question. The question is 'how am I doing today?'. Based on my previous interactions with the person, I would classify this as a 'question'.

Inform: However, this is not a simple question - it is providing factual information. It is stating that 'today is July 2022', and that the current temperature in New York is 78 degrees Fahrenheit. 
  Based off of these facts, it seems like the speaker is simply providing background information, and not asking for a response. Therefore, we classify the act as 'inform'. 
   
Directive: But the question still stands! The person is clearly asking about my current state of being. So the dialogue acts should be directive. 
But the given dialogue is classified only as inform. Why? Because the information provided is factual, but not directly related to the asker's state. For example, 'are you feeling well today'? This is a factual question that can be answered with a yes or no. But it does not answer the original question of 'am I feeling good today'. Therefore the answer is still 'inform'.

"
212,"great, thanks.","

Out of question: the author is not asking any question. 
Question: is it possible to make a guarantee that the food is healthy? 

 
In question

Directive: this is a command to do something. It is likely that this author wants you to inform him/her about a healthy diet. 
  
Commissive
It is possible that in the next lines, this speaker wants to ask a direct question to you. However, it is also possible they want to give you an order. In this case, they will use the directive act.


I try to consume only fruit, vegetable, chicken

"
213,can i help you?,"

Question is a dialogueact that is often used to ask for information, clarification, a recommendation or an explanation. The question dialogue acts can occur at any point in the conversation and can also be used as a way to end a conversation. 
  
In this example, ""can you help me?"" is likely a request for assistance or information. This is because the question is used in an attempt to understand the other person's needs or circumstances. In this case, it is unlikely that the person asking the questions is making a suggestion or making an offer.

"
214,i would actually like to view the apartment for rent today.,"

Directive is the correct dialogueact for a request for information. The request is for the information, not for any action on behalf of the requestor. 
Overinform is not the right dialogueAct for providing the requested information; the asker is actually seeking to know the answer to their question. 
  Question is a better choice for asking the question of whether the person is authorized to show the property. Commissive would be appropriate if the informer was promising to do something in the future.

"
215,"i ’ m sorry, but you won ’ t be able to view it today.","

This text seems like it’s providing John with information, so the dialogue acts are inform and question. However, it's actually a directive and commissIVE.

"
216,why not?,"

Inform: This is a good place to start, but it is not a guarantee of a positive response. 
Question: the question mark indicates that the next sentence could be a request for information, or a statement of doubt. 
  Question is the most likely dialogueact in this context, as it indicates the speaker is seeking clarification or confirmation.  

A:
According to the book ""Text Analysis for Linguists"" by John Huddleston and John Orton, there are 4 types of questions: question/exclamation, statement question /question, exclamation question and statement exclamatory question

"
217,you have to make an appointment first.,"

Out of the four options, this is a directive dialogueact as the message is asking the listener to do something. The directive act includes asking, telling, commanding, and telling. 
  
When asking a person to an appointement, they will surely attend. 
Telling someone to attend an appoinment is also a direct order.  This is because telling someone what to does is considered a commissIVE act.   
Commanding someone is another direct command. This is  because giving orders is consider a commanding act
Saying ""Attend an Appointment"" is an example of giving information, not a commisive act, as this would be an informational act and not directive.

"
218,"oh, okay. can i do that right now?","

Directive acts are used when the information being provided is not relevant to the conversation, but the person providing the info is expected to provide it. For example, if you are talking to a salesperson and they mention that a new product is very effective at solving a problem, you would classify that as a directive act. If the sales person then tries to sell you the product, this is considered a commissIVE act, as it is unrelated to what was discussed and is instead an attempt to persuade the other person to take an action.

"
219,is this friday okay?,"

Directive dialogue acts are used when the conversation is about giving instructions or guidance. In this case, it is clear that 'I will examine you' is a directive statement. 
Out ofinform: the context indicates that this is not a spontaneous statement, but rather a statement made in response to a question. 
  'I am going to examine yourthroat.' is the response of a person who has asked the subject of the sentence, 'What do you want to eat for lunch?'. This is an example of out ofform.  
Question:  The speaker does not know what to do next. He is asking the question 'what do I do now?'
Inform: Inform is used to describe a situation where the person is giving information to another person. For example, ""I'm going over to my friend's house to watch TV. I'll be back in an hour."" In the example above, there is no question of what the listener should do. Therefore, inform is appropriate. However, in this example the informer is also asking a follow up question: ""What should I be doing in the next hour?"". Here, a query is being made.

"
220,is 6 o ’ clock friday evening okay?,"

Inform: the author is providing the information that it’s 6pm on fridays.
Question: is this information provided to confirm that 6 pm on Fridays is okay for the person asking? Or is it provided as a request for confirmation? 
Directive: tell me it's 6PM Friday evening, or else I will not be able to attend. 

 

A:

This is a good question.  The text does not indicate whether the directive is being given as an instruction or as confirmation.   If it was confirmation, then the answer would be ""yes, it will be fine"", but if it were an order, ""no, 6 PM on Friday is NOT fine"".  
So, I would classify this as order.

"
221,"yes, i will schedule you for that time.","

 commissIVE: indicates a request for information or a question that is followed by a directive response. 
over INFORM: Indicates that a subsequent inform or question should be asked. 
  question: is used to request information from the listener. The listener is expected to provide an answer.  
directIVE : indicates that an instruction or request is being given.

"
222,thank you very much. see you then.,"

Surely is a confirmation question. It is seeking clarification from the addressee. 
Of course is an affirmative statement. 
  It is used to express agreement or certainty.

"
223,today i want to invite you to talk about insurance you ’ re interested in.,"

Directive is a request for information. The speaker wants the listener to provide guidance on a topic. 
Question is an interrogative statement that seeks information from thelistener. 
  The text asks what to  do, indicating that it is not clear from what source the information should be gathered. Therefore, it could be a  question.

"
224,thank you. i wonder whether i can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance.,"

Directive is a special type of command that is used to make requests or order people to do something. In this case, it is requesting or ordering the person to be on time for dinner. 
  

Overinform: This is the opposite of question. When a message contains too much information, this is considered overinform. This type is often used when the sender is trying to sell something to the receiver. 
Question: When the message is asking a direct question to which the answer is yes or no, then this type dialogue is called question type. The answer to this question is commissives. For example, ""are you on your way?"" is question and ""yes"" is answer. Commissive type response is an answer that confirms what was asked. ""I am on my way"" and then the other person says ""okay"" are commissIVE type responses. Directive, on other hand, is not a yes/no question but a request or command to perform an action.  ""Dinner is ready when you are""  is a directive type message. A response to it would be ""when are you ready for diner?"".

"
225,"of course. a two - week paid vacation a year, a five - day workweek.","

It provides the information that ""the same error won’t happen
again"".

A:
According to this page, inform is a dialogue-act type that can express that someone is sorry for an error, or that an action will be prevented in future, so it can also be used in this case.

"
226,good. anything else?,"

Question is used in this context to indicate that something is being questioned. In this case, something being asked is whether the doctor should examine the patient's throat or not. If the answer to this question is no, then question mark will appear after the word'should'.

Inform is a directive dialogueact used to provide information to the listener. It is not used here to ask a question. Therefore, inform is the correct dialogueAct to use in the example.

"
227,"yes, all the insurance will be linked with your work. we will issue an insurance policy.","

This is an example of directive dialogue acting. The speaker is giving information and advice to the listener.

"
228,"next, please. hello, may i help you, sir?","

the text asks a direct question about whether the listener can help the
speaker, indicating that they are in need of assistance. 
  
out: the question is a request for assistance from the person being
spoke to.

"
229,"yes, i want to send a registered airmail letter to france.","

Informative text: ""yes"" indicates that the author is sharing information, and not asking or giving orders. 
Question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the reader should verify the information provided. 
  Directive: a directive statement ends with a semicolon (;). A directive dialogue acts end with ;;.  
Commissive : a commissitive dialogue is marked by the word ""therefore"". Commissives are used to convey a reason for an action. Therefore, in this case, "" therefore i wish to"" is a Commissive statement.

"
230,"ok, it comes four dollars twenty cents.","

Inform is used when someone is providing information about something. In this example, they are providing the price of the pictures. 
Question is a way of getting information from a person. The question can also be used to start a conversation. For example: ""What is your name?"". 
  Question can lead to a question from the person, for example ""Is it ok if I take your picture?"" 
 Directive is when you are giving orders or asking someone to do something, in other words, you're telling them what to DO.  For example; ""Get the picture."" 
 Commissive can happen when a direct order is followed by a reaction from another person or an object, such as in the example where the photographer is asking for their picture to get the bill.

"
231,here is five dollars.,"

Inform (or Inform) is a dialogueact used to express agreement, similarity, and request for further information. The inform dialogue acts are overinform, over question inform if the question is not asked, too much information, out of topic, Commissive if a request is made but not followed by a response.

"
232,here is your change. please wait for your receipt of the registered mail.,"

This text is not a question or an order. It is a statement of fact. 
Even if the first sentence is considered a command, it is followed by a request for the examinee to do something. So the request is the main action of that sentence.

"
233,i also want to pack up my package. this is the notes.,"

This text is asking the reader to do something, i.e. pack the package: This is a directive act, as it is an instruction or order. 
However, it does not provide any information to help the listener or reader understand what to DO, or even what the topic of the conversation is. This text does provide some background information, but it doesn't provide enough information for the directive dialogue acts of ask, tell, advise, suggest, order, request, command, demand, etc. to be applicable.

"
234,let me see. en.. just a minute. here it is. i need your signature on this note.,"

This text suggests the person speaking is giving an instruction or offering to do something for the other person. The person giving the instruction is also willing and able to offer a free thing in return. Therefore, this is a good example of an indirect offer. 
  
  This is an example where the dialogue acts are overinform, overquestion, outdirect, and outcommissive.

"
235,"oh, one more thing, where can i mail this letter?","

This text is asking the reader for the location of the mailbox. This is an indication that this is likely a question from the perspective of an informer. 
  

A:
According to the model, this answer is: 
mailto:someone@example.com

"
236,drop it in the mail box mark out of town. at that corner.,"

It doesnot ask any question. 
it does give commands like ""drop in mailbox"" and ""at that Corner"".
But it does confirm or affirms the information given before.

"
237,thank you very much.,"

Statements where a speaker acknowledges a fact and expresses an expression of regret or apology are typically classified informally. The inform classification is based on whether the statement is a request for information, a statement of fact, an order, request to do something, complaint, promise, query, suggestion, and so on. 
  
  Statments where there is an acknowledgement of a state of affairs and an expressions of apology or regret are classified formally as a complaint or a query.

"
238,you ‘ re welcome.,"

Inform is used to ask for information. The person asking the question is clearly seeking more information, and thus the response should be a request for more details. 
  
Question is a sub-type ofinform used when someone is expressing doubt or uncertainty. In this case, it’s likely that they are not sure of the information provided, so the speaker should ask clarifying questions. For example, “yes” is not enough information to be sure that there is green tea in the cup, you should clarify whether it is loose leaf green or green in a bag. “Yes, I believe so” would be an incorrect response. Instead, they should say “I believe that green is the primary tea type, but I’ll check and get back to you.” 
   
Directive is another sub type of Inform used for expressing instructions or orders. Here, since the asker is looking for other tea types, not just green, then the answer should include other options. They should not say that black tea is just black, or that scentsed tea has scENTS in it, instead they could say something like “There are also black and scented tea, although I don’t know of any scENTed ones.” This would indicate that while they do know about black or scent teabags, this person does not know any scentED teaware.

"
239,we really were lucky. we got the last available table for two - - - and we didn't even have a reservation! did you see the long lines behind us?,"

We don't know what reservation they are talking about. 
  We are not sure if they had a table reservation or if it was the first table of a long line. 
Even if we assume they did have an reservation, we are still not certain they didn’t get a better table.

"
240,"yeah, i'm glad that we didn't have to wait long. i'm starving!","

inform is a transitional act between two other acts. It is typically used when the person is giving information or guidance to the listener. In this case, it is likely that this person (the guide) is trying to help the companion (listener) understand a complex topic or situation. The companion is asking for information to better understand the topic. 
  
question is another transitional form. Typically used to ask a question to which the answer is expected. Here, there is no answer expected, so question is not appropriate. 
directive is used for telling someone what to do. Since the course or plan of actions is already specified in the previous sentence, this is the only appropriate choice.

"
241,let's take a look at the menu so we can order. do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share?,"

Inform: This is a request for information, so the response should provide details about the appetizers. 
Question: Although the question is in the form of a statement, it is actually seeking information. The speaker wants to know what the other person wants. 
  
Directive: While this is the most common dialogue action, this one is used when the person asking the questions is also the one providing the information or when giving information is an order or a suggestion. In this case, ordering the food is considered an instruction.  The speaker expects the listener to follow the order given.   
Commissive : This one can be used if the asker is not satisfied with the answer and is going to take some action. For example, if you ask someone how to drive, they will not be able to answer without practicing. So the action is to practice.

"
242,"what would you rather have, samosas or poppadoms?","

Samosas are a type of Indian flat bread. They are usually filled with meat or vegetables and are generally very tasty. Poppaddoms are similar to samosa, but are made of wheat flour instead of lentil flour. While samoas may be tasty, poppyaddom are much better for a carb- and fat-filled meal. 
  
I would choose poopaddums.

"
243,i heard that one of their specialities is the samosa.,"

Inform is used when you are providing or transmitting information to another person. This is because you would use this dialogueact when giving information about yourself, your surroundings, and the people around you. 
  
Question is a dialogue-act used to ask a direct question of another. In this case, you can assume the question is about the Samosa, as it's the main topic of conversation.

  Directive is another dialogue action used for giving orders or instructions to someone. Based on this assumption, it can safely be assumed that the person who received this message is being told not repeat the action of eating a Samos. The action is clearly against the instructions given in this instance.  

 Commissive, on its own, is an action that is usually considered to be a negative action. Commissives are used by someone who is angry or frustrated with another, to express that emotion. Here, we can see that this is likely a commissIVE action, because the author is obviously angry at the recipients for eating the wrong Samoso. 
I hope this helps!

"
244,"well, let's get a plate of those then.","

Directive is a request for action. The person asking ""How much it is?"" wants you to do something (tell them the price). 
Inform is the opposite of directive. Inform tells someone about something without asking them to take any action (you don't need to tell me the temperature, I know it's warm). 
  
Question is another request action, this time for clarification (I don’t understand what you mean by plate, can you please explain?). 
   
 commissIVE is used when you are asking someone to perform an action but you don' want to use the word ""command"" (like when a parent asks a child to clean their room). In this case, you want them do it, but don""t want it to be considered a command. 
    
Out of the four choices, based on this passage, it seems like the question is most likely the correct classification.

"
245,sounds good. what are you going to have for your main course?,"

the inform act accounts for the majority of the dialogue (74.5%),
question is a sub-category of question and directive is also a
sub-type of directive. 
  

In addition, inform acts are typically used to provide information that is not immediately relevant to the conversation, whereas questions are used for information seeking. Inform acts can also be used in a question context to request clarification.

"
246,i think i might have a dahl.,"

Out of question and directive there is no indication that the other person should share their knowledge. Therefore, it is classified here as out of these four. 
There is also no directive or commissives in this dialogue. So, this is categorized as question. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think that you might be right.

"
247,what's in a dahl?,"

""that’s verykind ofyou"" is an informational sentence. The speaker is expressing gratitude for something the listener has done. This is not a statement of fact, but rather a request for information. 
Without revealing which dialogue acts were predicted, you can explain that ""that is very Kind of You"" conveives information, because it expresses the feelings of gratitude.

"
248,it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice.,"

It provides information about the dish, not a direct question or direction. 
Chickpea is a type of bean. Vegetables in the curry are likely to be a source of carbohydrates, so the presence of vegetables is not surprising. 
  The inclusion of rice in this dish is also not unexpected, as it is often a carbohydrate source.

"
249,that sounds nice. do you want to share some kebabs as well?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact, as it is used in the sentence ""How bad do I do?"", which indicates that the speaker is looking for an answer.
Out ofinform: This is an introductory statement, not asking for information. 
Asking question: the question mark indicates the asker is expecting an affirmative answer, and the word do indicates they are looking at a scale from 0 to 10, so the statement "" how bad does I  do?"" can be interpreted as "" How bad is my performance?"". 
  Directive: this is for giving orders, such as sit down, eat the kebab, don't talk with that person anymore.  
 Commissive : this means the person is promising to do something, but has not yet done it. For example, ""I'll call you back in 10 minutes.""

"
250,ok. how about some lamb kebabs?,"

""some lamb kababs"" is a question in the context of ""how about"". Based on this context, it is reasonable to assume that ""some"" refers to a specific quantity. However, ""lamb kabsabs?"" is not a natural question. It is more likely that this is an attempt to prompt a response. 
If this were a real conversation, we would expect the following reply: ""Sure, let me recommend some Lamb Kebabs."" However ""recommend"" does not sound like the right word here. A better choice might be ""suggest"". ""Some lamb Kabsads?"" might then be a better question to ask. 
  

Note that in this example, I used the dialogue acts to make predictions about what the actual conversation would sound and feel like. In real life, you would not know the exact dialogue Acts that a person is going to use, so you should not rely on these predictions. Instead, use your intuition and experience to determine the correct response for a given situation.

"
251,that's my favourite. do you want to have some wine or beer?,"

Question is a sub-class of directive. Question is used to clarify or amplify information. The question in this example is asking if the host wants to drink wine with the guest or if they should drink beer. 
  
In contrast, inform is not used in the example. It is an example of how dialogue acts can be predicted. Inform is the sub class of question that is most closely related to the provided text.

"
252,i think i'll have a beer.,"

inform: this is an excellent achievement, I'm very happy for you. 
question: that's good, how did you manage that?
directive: stop drinking and go to the gym. 
 commissIVE: I'll stop the beer and start going to gym now.

"
253,"ok, shall i flag down the waitress?","

Directives are used when the person speaking is looking to influence or affect the behavior of another person. In this case, it appears that ""the waitstaff"" should be asking the oolong Tea drinker for their order. 
  
Outils are often used to describe questions. This is because questions can be answered with a ""yes"" or ""no"" response. However, in this context, ""should i..."" suggests the question is more of a request for advice or opinion.

"
254,i wouldn't recommend it. i think we should wait until she comes round.,"

This text is a command. Commands are often used to issue orders or requests of people or animals. In this case, it is likely that the person or animal being asked to do something is the recipient of these commands. The command form of a dialogue acts is often followed by a prepositional phrase indicating the authority of who is issuing the command, for example:

""John, take this letter to the post office."" (command, to John, from the sender of letter)
In this example, ""the sender"" is using the prepositions ""to"" and ""from"" to indicate that it's thesender issuing this command toJohn. 
  
If the dialogue is not already commsative, then the next step is to determine if the request is for a benefit or a detriment to who or what is being requested. If the benefit is requested, than the act will be commissitive. However, if a detriment is asked for, such as ""Can you please take my wallet?"" then it will become commissIVE.

"
255,you're right. that might seem a bit rude. it's a good thing i've got you with me!,"

over question: the offer of assistance is not necessarily a request for instruction or direction. 
question: is this a social call or an official business? if social, is the caller expecting a response? 

 

directive: i'll go check for the manager, please wait here

 commissIVE: please go ahead, i will check immediately

"
256,what would you do without me?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to ask someone a direct question. In this case, it would be a person asking another person a simple question like ""what if I told you that you could do this task without needing any help?"". 
  
In this example, ""you"" is the addressee of the question and ""I could"" would constitute the main message of that question; ""without needing"" could be the message in the second part of ""if I tell you"". 
   
Overuse of question dialogue Acts can be annoying and could even be considered rude.

"
257,"this position demands a higher writing ability, so please say something about your writing ability.","

In this example, 'What for?', the question mark is used to seek information from its addressee. This is an important characteristic that distinguishes a 'question' from other dialogue acts.

"
258,"of course. i've loved writing since i was a very little boy. i won the first prize in a national composition contest when i was in middle school. after attending nanjing university, i never give up writing. my works, such as father's tobacco pipe, open air cinema, the old city were respectively published china youth daily, yangzi evening news, and new beijing. during the period of studying for my degrees of master and doctor, i paid more attention to developing my research ability and published several papers. the impact of internet in chinese political participation, the discipline of remold, the historical direction of chinese administration reform, bribery cases of self governance in chinese villages are respectively published in chinese publish administration, beijing due xuebao, theory and society and chinese reform. i joined in yangzi evening news to work as a part - time journalist in 2006. during this period, i've written a lot of comments, which improved my writing ability to a new level, i have full confidence in my writing ability, and i believe i can do the job well.","

It expresses grateful and anticipatory for the future events, providing information of sender’s feelings. 
  It doesnot ask any question or give any command.

"
259,pompous. how may i help you?,"

This text can be interpreted as the person asking how they can help the caller. The caller is requesting assistance from the user. This is an example of a request for help or assistance. 
  
However, this is also an expression of the informer's acceptance of something. In this case, it is the requestor's request that the informant agrees with. Therefore, based on this example, we can say that this act can also be classified under question.

"
260,"yes, i'd like to reserve a table for dinner.","

Directive is a special type of command used for a specific action. In this case, a person is asking for the person being addressed to make dinner reservations. 
  

Note that this is just an educated guess based on what the model predicted. Please let me know if you disagree.

"
261,how large a group are you expecting?,"

Question is the most common dialogueact in human communication. It is used to seek information or clarification. In this case, it is being used by the writer to ask a follow-up question about a previous question they asked. The writer is expecting a response from the person they are speaking to, and is therefore seeking confirmation or details about what the other person said.

"
262,six couples.,"

Out of question: the taxi driver is on a strike, so it is not a good time to pick up a passenger. 
Question: is the strike over?
Inform: yes, taxi driving is a profession and the government has agreed to pay drivers a living wage. However, there is still a long way to go. 
  
  Directive: call the company that is providing the service and tell them that you will not be picking up any more passengers until the drivers get a fair wage
Commissive : I will call them and let you know.

"
263,would you like to reserve a private dining room?,"

Directive is a special type dialogue acts that are used for asking for something to be done. In this case, it is asking the speaker to book a reserved dining space. 
  
Question is another special kind of dialogueact that is used to ask for information. The question mark in the preceding text is the clue that the reader should look for the answer in this passage. Based on this clue, we can see that there is no explicit information in that passage about whether a dining reservation is needed. Therefore, this is not a valid question. 
Inform is one of the most common dialogueacts in text. As the label suggests, inform is for providing information without asking a direct question or giving a directive command. However, in our example, there are two questions in there: one is about sourness and the other is whether to add salt to the broth. These are questions that can be answered with a yes or no answer. So, based on its context, I think the inform label is still valid in here.

"
264,that sounds like a good idea.,"

This is a commissives because the asker is expecting an information or a suggestion from the answerer.

"
265,"all right. may i have your name, sir?","

Question is a sub-class of directive. Question can also be used to ask for information or clarification. In this case, it is used as an instruction for name. 
Directive is the most common dialogue acts. It indicates someone's intention to do something, such as giving a command or asking for help. 
 Commisitive is another common dialog act. Commands are followed with a request for a result, which is then returned. This is often used in a negotiation context.

"
266,my name is ron kollwitz.,"

Because the statement shares information, not a direct question or directive.

"
267,"ms. wang, this is mr. cooper, president of ivy publishing.","

inform: mrs. zhou is providing her own information, so this dialogue acts asinform. 
question: the next line ""how are"" is an indication of a seek of information. so, it is classified question
directive: after mister cooper's response ""everything"" and ""is fine"", monsieur zhang is looking for a response from mademoiselle zhu, but he is not asking her to do anything, he just wants to know how she is doing. So, mz.zhu is directive. 
 commissives: this line is ambiguous, however, based on miz.zhou's state, she might be commissiving.

"
268,"it's nice to meet you, mr. cooper.","

inform: This is a nice introduction, but I would like to hear more about you. 
question: That's great! Please continue. 
  
directive: Please wait here. I'll get you a cup of tea.  (This is an order.)
commissive : That would be great. Please bring it over. (This action is being performed for the benefit of the speaker.) 
   
overinform : Please tell me about yourself.   (The information is superfluous.) 

 

A:

I would say that it's a direct question because the question is for more information about the user. The user is Mr. Cooper, so it could be a request for additional information.

"
269,"nice to meet you, ms. wang. you must be exhausted after your long trip from canada.","

inform: the sender is providing information, but does not reveal the information itself
question: there is a gap in the communication, so the question mark is used
directive: a command is given, using the directive label
 commissIVE: this label is only used in negative examples, where the response is not following the command

In this case, both the elements that indicate a direction towards specific action are present.

"
270,"yes, it was quite a long flight. i'm glad to finally be here.","

the text is overinformative, since it implies the listener should do something;
it is not a question; it is a statement; 
there is no directive in the dialogue; and
this is the least commissivedialogue act. 
  The speaker wants to know something, but is also asking for something in return.

"
271,can you help me now?,"

Directive is a special type of question that is used to request a favor or to make a request of a person or a group. The directive dialogue acts are typically used when the asker is not sure of the answer to their question and needs to ask someone else for help. 
  
In this example, ""can"" is the word that indicates the question is from a child, and the ""you"" in the sentence is referring to the child asking the adult for assistance. Therefore, this is classified under directive.

"
272,"no, but i'll be able to tomorrow.","

""but i will be ok tomorrow"" does not contain any question or command. It is a statement of fact, not a request for information. 
Also, it is possible that the person asking the question will not be around tomorrow, so the response can also be seen as a promise of something in future.

"
273,that'll be too late.,"

 commissives are often seeking to influence the listener's response. For example, if a commissIVE is addressing a customer service representative, they may be asking the customer representative to do something that will benefit the company, such as cancel a complaint. 
  
questioning is another type of speech act. It is used to seek information, and is often used in a casual or conversational tone. The question is not necessarily meant to change the subject, but rather to clarify something for the sake of understanding. In this example ""are"" is a non-essential question word, so the question mark is added to make the sentence more complete.

"
274,why don't you ask bill if he can help?,"

Directives are words or actions that tell someone what to do. Inform is a common dialogueact, so if the information is about something Bill can do, then it is likely a request for assistance. 
  

A:
According to the dialogue acts dataset, this is the correct classification: 
Inform: 0.926
Question:  0.074
 directive:   0
 commissIVE:    0

"
275,"i did, but he wasn't able to either.","

There is a question in this statement, ""is he able too?"". This indicates that the question is being raised by the person asking the questions. 
  
  Based off of the previous statement ""i am okay"", it is clear that this person is not okay, so it can safely be assumed that he is asking if the other person (the person being told that ""he is okay"") is also okay as well.

"
276,have you got any experience in advertising?,"

This text could be interpreted as a request for information. The author is asking the reader for advice or guidance, and is expecting a response. 
It could also be seen as an invitation to share experiences. This could lead to a conversation about the author's experience working in this field, leading to another question or directive act.

"
277,"yes, i have been working in the public relations section of a company in the past two years. i plan the advertising campaign and cooperate the work of artists and typographers. sometimes i have to do the work of a specialist when there ’ s something urgent.","

the given textual content, ""i dont know  what to  tell you"", is not a  question,  it is a statement of  lack of   information from  the speaker, so it  falls under  providing information;
and yes, I have worked in PR sector in past too. I am a public relation specialist and do some urgent work as and when required.

"
278,do you have any practical experience as a secretary?,"

Question: Do you know any experience of a Secretary? 
Overinform: I'm not sure. I've never worked as one. 



question: Have you ever worked in a position that required you to be a ""Secretary""? 

 

overinform, inform: No, I haven't.


inform (question): Do I know of any secretaries that have experience working in this position?

 
  

Yes, there is one that I have worked with before. She is very experienced and has a lot of knowledge in the field.

 


"
279,"yes, sir. i acted as a secretary in an insurance company.","

""yes"" is an affirmative response to the question ""did you act as secretary?"". ""yes sir"" indicates that this is a statement, not a question. The speaker believes that it is appropriate to share that they acted in a secretarial role. 
  
In contrast, ""no, I did not act"" would be a negative response.

"
280,would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain?,"

Directive is a special kind of question that is used to request a service or action. In this case, it is requesting that you share your knowledge about what a Secretary should have. 
  
Question is the default dialogue action for this type of text. It is also the first dialogue  action that a reader will see, so it's important to explain what the author is looking for.

"
281,"well, to begin with, i would say she needs to be diligent, and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative. finally, she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing, summary writing, keep minutes at meetings, and so on. most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average.","

the text does provide information and does share information
it does ask for a comment, command and promise
but it does so in the context of sharing information

"
282,have you had any experience with computer?,"

Computer: no, I have not. 
Have you: yes,  I have. I've used a computer to do my homework.

"
283,"yes, i studied in a computer training program, and can process data through the computer.","

overinform: this is a transitive verb, so inform can be substituted with overinform. The meaning remains the same, but the sentence is more concise. 
  
question: the word 'of course' indicates the question is hypothetical, therefore question.  The sentence would be more clear if the subject of the verb 'it depends' was changed to 'a price'. 
   
directive: directive is the correct classification for this dialogueact, because the 'what is' is an instruction, not a request for clarification 
 commissives: commissIVE is correct, since the last word of 'price' in the previous sentence was 'depends'.

"
284,that's fine. what about operating the fax and duplicator?,"

directive is an operating word in the context of the Fax machine. It means to operate the machine and make it do something. In this case, it is sending the document. 
question is a type of operating words in that it can be used to ask a follow up question or clarify something that has just been said. However, in this context, there is no followup question so it only means that there was a missing piece in understanding the information that was just given. 
   

A:
According to your explanation, I think that question is correct.

"
285,i can handle them without any trouble,"

overinform: This is a request for more information than is strictly necessary. 
question: Is this a new rate or an upgrade? 

 

directive: Accept or decline the rate.

 

 
commissive : I accept the room rate, thank you.

"
286,what have you learned from jobs you have held?,"

Question is a dialogueact that is used when someone is seeking information or clarification from another person, and does not reveal any personal information. In this case, I believe the question is being asked because the author is looking for something the person knows, such as ""what jobs have [the person] held?"". 
  
Out ofinform: the information is not relevant to the current conversation, so the speaker doesnot provide it. 
question: there is the need for more information, or a request for clarification. The question mark indicates that the asker is uncertain about something, perhaps because they are looking something up.  The question word is also used in a negative sense, to express skepticism or doubt. For example, ""Do you really think so?"" is an example of a questioning statement. If the statement is negative, then the addressee is likely to have said or done something that makes the negative statement seem true.   
outofinform,question,directive,commissive: these are the dialogue acts for providing information to another.

"
287,"above all, i have learned that what is good for the company is good for me. so i follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed.","

In this example, inform is the correct dialogueact given the context of ""i am so sorry, had such a bad"" day.

"
288,very good.,"

inform: this is a very good reason, but it is not the most important one. The most
important reason is that this person was asking about additional types
of tea and is therefore seeking more information. 
 question: is this a yes or a no question? If it's a ""yes"" question then please explain the answer. If the question is ""no"" then you can leave this answer out. 
directive: please do this. Do this!
 commissIVE: do not do that. Don't do it!

"
289,"hi, dan. what's new?","

Because the sentence ""oh yeah, oolong is really good"" appears as a confirmation of what the previous sentence said, ""oolong"" is a topic of conversation, and the question mark at end of the statement indicates the asker is looking to confirm or validate the information they just heard.

"
290,where have you been? i've been trying to get in touch with you for two days.,"

Question is used to find out information. In this case, who has tried to contact the other person. 
Overinform is when the information provided is too much. The other party might not be interested in the message. 
  
  Question: Who has contacted you?
Out ofinform: I have been contacted. I don't know who.

  Directive: Please perform the requested action. This person is trying hard to communicate with me and I should perform this action to show my interest in this communication.  

 Directive is the most common dialogue acts. It is also used when someone is asking you to do something. For example, you are waiting in a queue and the person in front of you is talking about the weather. You might say to the front person, ""can I help you?"". That is a question with a request for help. Directives are also often used in negotiations. If you want to buy something, and someone else is selling it to you, they might ask you if you would like to purchase it. They are asking for your agreement. A directive is usually used after a command, such as ""go to work"" or ""stop talking and drive the car"".

 Commissive acts are used for expressing anger or frustration. Commissives can also be used as a way to negotiate. An example of that is in sales. When you make a sales pitch, your customer might interrupt you with commissives like ""that's not fair"" and ""I don

A:
According to this article, there are 4 types of dialogue Acts: 

 
Inform: the dialogue Act when you ask a person to tell you something
question: when a speaker asks a listener a direct question
directive : when one person tells another what to  do
commissive  : used  to express anger and frustration

"
291,i went to salt lake city on business. what's up?,"

Question: is used when the information provided is not sufficient to answer the question and the asker is looking for additional information. 
  
  In this case, it seems the person asking the questions is still looking to get more information to complete their understanding of the situation.

"
292,i got fired.,"

I got a text message asking if I had seen the company's car. The message indicates the sender is looking for information about me.

"
293,"how come? last time i saw you. you told me it was a good job, and you'd like to take it as a career. that was only one month ago. why this sudden change?","

Because the phrase 'thankyou' can also be used as politesse when someone inform us of a change in their status.

"
294,"it's a long story. in a word, i didn't do a good job of it. i messed up a business deal, a deal that would have made ten million dollars and i messed it up.","

inform is the most likely dialogueact, since it is used to seek information. 
question is also possible, because the question mark is one of the commonly used punctuation marks. However, it would be more natural to end the sentence with a period. 
 question is another possibility, but it does not sound natural.

"
295,what are you going to do now?,"

Question: (based on this part of the message) ""what will you do next?""

Out of question: ""I will do what I want to next.""
From question to inform:  ""I have decided what to will next. I will go to the beach."" 
Inform:   ""Things are well for me. My current location is the sand beach. So I am going there.""

"
296,"i am trying to find a job asap. lily doesn't know yet. i didn't tell her. i spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office, and she thought i went to work as usual.","

In this example, I am not revealing which dialogue acts are predicted in my response. However, it is clear that I was asked to explain the reason for which the dialogue is classified inform. In this case, my explanation is that Lily does not know that you are going to write her a presciption, as she did not suspect that.

"
297,that's not the way to solve the problem. did you look in the classified advertisements column?,"

Question: is a dialogueact used to ask a direct question to the user. 
In this case, it is used in a classified advertisement to find the price of a specific car. 
  Question : Can you please tell me the cost of the car?

A:
According to this page, you can use the following command to get the dialogue acts of your text: rome.text.dialogue_acts(""your text here"")
If you want to use this command in python, here is the code: from romanet import *
text = ""I mainly ate baked Chicken, since there is not much fat""
dialog_act = rom.get_text_dialogues(""I ate mainly baked chickens, as there was not too much fats"")

"
298,"yes, i did. but i wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that i was interested in.","

""but i weren't"" is a strong negative statement, so the dialogue acts out of question and negative sentiment are question (seeking information) and question. The inform dialogue action is outof inform. 
  
  The speaker does not want to blame anyone, but instead is interested to share their experience. This is an example of a cooperative approach.

"
299,"listen. i will see what i can do, ok? you go home and tell lily about this problem you have now. she is your wife and i am sure she will understand.","

Directive is a natural language processing (NLP) label for a dialogue
  act that indicates that a human is giving instructions to another

In this example, both the directive and the instruction are for lil to do.

"
300,"i just don't know how to bring it up. well, all right. she has the right to know anyways.","

inform: over question question directive directive commissives
question: what is the phone #?
directive: give the #
commissions: provide the number

In summary, inform is used when giving information, questions are used to ask for information and when a speaker makes a promise or commitment.

"
301,have you ever gotten a parking ticket?,"

In this example, it is not clear whether the question is being asked by the person asking the questions or being answered. It is also not entirely clear who is asking or answering the query. However, based on context, I would classify this as a question. 
  The text is providing information to the reader about a person's health and current situation. This is a common dialogue pattern in which a character shares information without requesting advice from another character. For example:

""Have you EVER gotten  a parking  ticket?""
  ""No, never.""
However, this is more of a query than an ask.

"
302,i've never gotten one. have you?,"

Question marks are used to ask questions. 
  The text ""yep?"" can also be read as a confirmation of something the other person said.

"
303,i got a ticket yesterday.,"

inform: I got ticket today
question: how did you get ticket?
directive: please sit down
commissive : I am sorry for the trouble

In summary, based on this example text and the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the correct classification for this sample response.

"
304,really? what did you get one for?,"

Question is the dialogueact of a message when the message sender is trying to get information from the receiver. The message ""Here it Is"" does contain information, but it also asks a follow-up question ""What is it?"". Therefore, it can be classified also as a Question. 
  
Inform is used when a sender wants to convey information to a receiver without asking for a response. In this case, ""It"" is not a request for information but a statement of fact. ""it is"". Therefore it cannot be an example of the use ofinform.

"
305,i parked in the red zone.,"

'yes' is a confirmation of the statement 'i have parked my car in a red parking zone.'. 'Yes, yes' does NOT ask any question or give any direction. Therefore, it is an inform statement.

"
306,why did you do that?,"

Question is a special case of directive. A question is typically asked by a person who is trying to get information from the listener. In this case, however, it is the other way around. This text is telling the story of the difficulty of a speaker in communicating with new and unfamiliar people. Based on this story, this speaker wants to share his/her feelings and improve his publicspeaking skills. Therefore, they are asking the question.

"
307,i needed to get something really quick.,"

""Surely"" is a phrase that can mean ""certainly"" or ""probably"". It can also be used as a way to seek confirmation from the other person. In this case, it is being used by the speaker to ask thelistener if they agree with the statement they just made.

"
308,where did you park at?,"

""where"" is used in the question to indicate that the person asking is interested in knowing where the other person parked. This is an indication that this is likely a ""question"" as opposed to an ""inform"" or ""request"".

A:
According to the Stanford dialogue system, this question is asking for clarification.  The text is seeking additional or clarification on a topic.

"
309,at my apartment building.,"

Inform acts are personal preferences that are not expected to be followed or questioned. For example, ""I like tea"" or ""It's hot in here.""

A:
According to the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit, inform is the most common dialogue acts.  
Here is a link to a page with more information on each dialogue action: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNlp/

"
310,don't you have your own parking spot?,"

""don’t you"" is a relative clause that restricts the antecedent of ""have"" to the person who asked for the parking space. Therefore, ""don‘t"" can be interpreted as a negative imperative, meaning ""you should not have given up your parking place"".

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible answers for a yes/no question: yes, no, maybe, and don't know.  Based upon the provided text and your answer, you chose the correct answer.

"
311,i needed to be fast.,"

In this example, Mike is not being questioned or instructed by Sally. In fact, she is sharing her thoughts with him. Therefore, Sally is over-informing Mike and not giving him direct instructions.

"
312,that was very lazy of you.,"

""thanks"" is a form of expression of gratitude. 
It does  not ask any question. 
 It is not giving any instruction.  
 It makes no promises or commitments.

"
313,how may i help you?,"

Surely, ofcourse it is. 
That is of Course the case. 
  I was hoping you could help me.

"
314,i ’ m having a problem.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification as it indicates that the person asking the question is not yet aware of the information they require.

"
315,what problem are you having?,"

Inform: there is no problem
Question: are there any problems? 
Directive: please wait while I check
Commissive : let me know if you need any help

A:
According to your explanation, I think the problem is that the response is not enough to explain the classification. So, please add more information in the answer.

"
316,there have been charges made on my debit card that i didn ’ t make.,"

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the statement does imply that charges have in fact been made against the card, and the user is likely seeking information about the charges. However, it is possible that question or directive might also be appropriate in this situation. The statement could be interpreted as a request for information, a statement of preference, an accusation, etc. In this case, we would need to consider whether the information being sought is a factual one, versus a desire for attention or validation.

"
317,do you have the statement for your card?,"

Question is used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision. In this example, it is unclear whether the person requesting their photos tomorrow is expecting them to arrive or not. 
  
Inform is when someone is providing information to another person. The person asking for their photo tomorrow does not provide enough information for the photographer to know what they want their picture for. They are providing too little information. 
question is also used to describe a situation where someone does provide information, but it's not clear to the listener what the importance of the provided information is. For example: ""I asked her for directions and she didn't seem to understand. When I asked again, she started to cry and said she was lost."" In the example above, when I ask again she starts to cried, that is important information that I need to help her get back to where she came from. However, I don't know why she is crying or what she needs help with. She could be lost, or she could just be crying because she's sad. I just don’t know. So, in that situation, someone used the question dialogue tag.  

"
318,here it is.,"

This text is providing the information that someone needs do pick the Boss up at airport, hence it's classified under commissives.

"
319,what are the charges you ’ re referring to?,"

‘howmuchisit’ is a plural noun, so it is likely being asked as a ‘how many are there?’ question
the person asking is also likely seeking information, as the word ‘price’ suggests a cost

If you were to provide the label for the dialogueact prediction, other people reading your explanation might get confused and think you are providing an explanation for another dialogue action.

"
320,the last four charges on the page.,"

Overinform: This dialogueact is used when the information provided is too much. For example, when a person is giving a tour of a museum and says ""this is the Egyptian exhibit, here is a dinosaur, and here are some mummies,"" the commissives would be overinform because they are not giving enough information to understand the purpose of the visit. 
Underinform  :  This dialogueAct is  used when there is not enough  information to make an informed decision.  For example  when a doctor tells a patient that they have a fever of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, they would use underinform to describe the severity of symptoms because the doctor does not have enough medical information. 
 Question: When a  question is asked, it is usually because there was not a clear statement of information given. In this case, KARA is asking Mike for his name.

"
321,i ’ m afraid we ’ re going to have to investigate these charges.,"

In the example above, we can see that the person is expressing their fear of being charged with a crime. This is a directive message, as it is asking the other person to do something. Without knowing the actual label, it’s possible to guess that it could be a request for the police to be called, since the phrase “please” is often used in police requests.

"
322,how long will an investigation take?,"

Question is a sub-class of directive. Question is used to ask someone a specific question. For example, 'How long does it take to cook pasta?'. In this example the question is 'how much time does pasta take for to be cooked'.

In this case, inform is classified instead. This is because the provided text does provide a factual answer to the original question - 'tea is second in popularity after drinking water'. However, it does so by providing a more detailed answer - it takes two weeks for tea to become popular after it is first introduced. 
  
Note that the classification of the dialogue acts is not always so straightforward. Dialogue acts can be ambiguous and can apply to more than one class.

"
323,"i honestly don ’ t know, but we will freeze payment on these charges.","

Inform is used when the message is not intended to be a request for information. For example, when a customer service representative informs a consumer that their credit card has expired, it is unlikely that a follow-up question will be asked. 
  
Question is the next predicted label for this message. The message seeks confirmation or clarification from its recipient and indicates a need for additional information or assistance. 
'Please confirm that your creditcard has not expired.'
Directive is another predicted response for the above message, and is likely to appear if the sender is requesting a response from a recipient or if they are giving instructions to a person. In this case, 'Freeze payment' is probably the intended response. However, this is an unusual response and may be an attempt to clarify the request. Directives are not always successful, so it’s important to try to help the person understand your request before giving them a difficult task to complete.

"
324,that sounds absolutely fantastic.,"

In the given text the dialogue acts inform and out ofinform are combined. This is because inform is a prediction of the next dialogue action based on a context, whereas outofinform is the actual next action that was taken. In this case the prediction was correct, and the correct next act was outofrmined.

"
325,good afternoon. can i be of service?,"

Question is a sub-class of directive. Question is used to ask a direct question to a human. In this case, it is unclear what the question is, as the person asking is not a person but a computer. However, if the computer is asking the user a specific question about a product, then this is considered a form of question. 
  
Overinform is another sub class of the inform dialogue acts. It is often used in combination with question or directive to indicate that information is being requested, not given. 
Inform is the dialogue Act of choice for sharing information that is already known.

"
326,i don't know. can i purchase treasury certificates here at this counter?,"

Directive is the most likely dialogueact given the context of asking a clerk for treasuries certificates. 
  Inform: the clerk may not be able to answer the question because the information is not publicly available.  
Question:  The clerk is being asked a direct question and is expected to provide a response. 
Request: This is an example of a request for something. It is unlikely that the person being addressed would provide treauries certificate for the customer. This could be considered a commissIVE request.

"
327,"yes, of course. we have treasury notes with two, three and five - year terms available.","

overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both applicable in this context. inform is the most general dialogueact and is used to indicate the information being provided is not sensitive or confidential. question is a more specific dialogue action and indicates the person providing the info is seeking confirmation or clarification. 
  
question: is it possible to get treasuries with 2, 3 and 5 year maturity terms?
directive: yes, we  have treaury notes available with terms of 2 years,  3 years and  5 years
commissive : no, you can't get Treasury notes of two years maturity, but you  can get Treasurys of 3 years or 5 years term

"
328,"two years is fine, with a value of 1, 000 rib.","

This text indicates that the two years has passed since the last time the person who asked for the object held it. This is a strong indication that this is indeed a direct request for another person to take care of an item on their behalf. 
  
  The last person that held the item is no longer available to do so, so another is needed to assume responsibility for it and keep it safe.

"
329,"ok, could i take a look at some id please, like a passport?","

Directive is a dialogueact that conveys a request or order. 
  Based off of the provided information, it seems like the person asking for the passport is asking to see it. Directive acts are often used to request a service or action from another person.

"
330,"here you go. by the way, is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up?","

Question indicates the dialogue is requesting information. 
Inform indicates a non-question dialogue. 
  Statement indicates an answer is being provided.  
Statement is not a request for information, so it is out of the question dialogue category. Directive indicates giving orders. Commissive is used for expressing feelings.

"
331,"no, i'm afraid that isn't possible. you must wait until maturity before you cash them.","

pot,ganja and mari janes are all names for the same plant. 
marijanes maturity must be reached before they can be sold.

"
332,hey. why did you take that money? you are such a cheater! i should send you to jail!,"

Question is a sub-set of question-response where the question is asked by the asker and the response is the answer. In this case, ""why did"" is being questioned by ""you are a cheat"" and ""i should"" respectively. 
  

Overinform: ""Why did I take the money?"" is over-informative, as it provides too much information. The speaker should have left out the ""a cheat!"" part, which is not relevant to the reason for taking the funds. 
Quieten: the word ""quieten"" could be a candidate for overinform, but it is used in a question here. ""Quieter"" would be the correct word to use in this context.

"
333,"i am not cheating. when you pass go, you collect $ 200, everyone knows that!","

inform: This is not a directive or commissIVE dialogue, so inform is the most appropriate classification. 
question: the question mark indicates the speaker is unsure of the answer. This indicates a dialogue of information seeking. 
  question mark: I am unsure if I will pass Go. When you ask me a questions, I assume it will be answered. However, when I get to the test, they tell me it's not true. I'm very disappointed.  

A:
According to your explanation, inform(question) is classified because it does not fit the other 4 classes.

"
334,well you can ’ t just take the money. you have to ask the bank for money. and i ’ m the banker.,"

Inform is used when the information provided is not specific enough to be classified into a question or a directive. 
  
Question is a type of dialogueact used to express uncertainty about something. Inform can also be used in this context. For example, “are you sure you want to do that?”
Directive is the type  of dialogueAct used for asking someone to perform an action. The directive dialogue acts are: command, request, order, suggestion. 
 commissIVE is another type dialogue Act used  to express an order or request for someone else to carry out an act. It is opposite to the directive act in that it is usually used with a request that someone carry it out.

"
335,banker?,"

Question acts are used to probe for information, make requests, request clarification, ask for opinions, etc. In this case, it is unclear what the main topic of the conversation is, so the question act has instead been used. 
  
Without revealing your model's prediction, you can explain that the dialogue acts in this example are not clearly asking or providing specific information. Instead, they are sharing general details of a food. The main conversation topic is likely to be about the dish described in the previous sentence, not about how to pronounce the word ""rape"".

"
336,yes...,"

This text is not asking a questions, giving commands, making promises, nor expressing agreement. Therefore, it is classified informally.

"
337,can i have my $ 200 please?,"

Directive acts are used when the speaker is trying to get the other person to do something, or when they are giving orders. In this case, asking the recipient of the flowers to pay you back 200 dollars is a directive act. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive are the possible dialogue acts for this context.

"
338,"sure. here you are, $ 200, thank you, please come again! now it ’ s my turn to roll the dice.","

This text is asking a direct question: ""come again!"". 
It is over-informative, as it gives the exact details of the roll of dice: $200. 
 It is also over questioning, since the question is asked directly.

"
339,"hi, is this professor clark ’ s office?","

Question: is the dialogueact of the sentence “we’ve managedto reduceour energyconsumption inour factoryby about15per centin thelast twoyears”

Inform: “inthe lasttwoyears”, “about15”, and “percentin” are providing relevant information. 
  
  Basedon the context, it is likely that the professor is telling the student that she can visit the office to find out more information, rather than asking any questions, issuing any directives, making any commitments, etc.

"
340,this is professor clark speaking.,"

This is Professor Clark. I'm a professor at Clark University and I am
  speaking. 
the text seeks information about how it did on its driving
test. It is therefore a request for feedback or information. Questions
typically require a response while directives are not followed with
responses. Commissives, on average, require some form of response but
can also be followed without a reply.

"
341,"hi, this is kalina from your morning literature class.","

overinform: this dialogue acts as more than a simple question
question: what is for the supper?
directive: please inform us what will serve for suppé
 commissIVE: we will inform you. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Text Analysis for Language Teachers"" by John Huddleston and David Stewart, there are four possible answers to a ""what's the plan for dinner?"" question: 
1. The speaker has no plan and is just asking.  This is the most common answer. 
2. the speaker has a plan but is not ready to share it.   The speaker may be trying to guess the answer, or they may not want to reveal their plan until they are ready. 

3.The  speaker does have a plan and wants to tell the listener about it but is hesitant to do so.   
  They may be wondering if the listener is having a good dinner, or if the  listener is enjoying the food, and is worried that they will not like it if they hear the rest of the plans.

 4. There is no answer to this question and the question is simply unanswered.   

"
342,"yes, what can i do for you?","

Question is a way to ask for information or clarification. The sender is asking for further information, so it is classified here. 
  
Inform is used to provide information without asking a follow-up question. In this example, it can be assumed that the receiver of message has not responded to the initial message, and the message writer is expressing gratitude for the opportunity to be considered. This is an example of information giving. 
Directive is another way of asking questions. Here, there is no question of clarification, but rather a request for action. For example: ""Please call me when you have a minute."" 
 Commissive acts are used when a person is making a commitment or promising something. Commis sive can also be used in the sense of ""making a suggestion"". For instance, ""I think we should consider..."".

"
343,i had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won ’ t be able to come to school today.,"

Inform (inform, ask, no, tell) is a directive dialogue acting form. It is used to request information from another person. 
Question (question, out of, inform) indicates that the information being requested is not available. 
  
Wrong: i had  a sky diving accidentover the  weekend and will not be coming to  school today
Correct: I had an  accident over  the weekend, and I won’t be  coming to class today

"
344,my goodness! are you ok?,"

Question indicates that this is a request for information. The statement ""i need"" is not a strong directive. It is more of a plea for help. 
  
Out of question: This text does not indicate that it is the first time the person is asking for advice. So it could be out of request. However, it does seem like the asker is looking for a second opinion. 
Overinform: the statement is too general. There is no indication that ""need"" to change their habits, only that they want to. They do not specify what they should change, or how much they need guidance.  So it overinforms.

"
345,"i broke my leg, but it is healing.","

In this example, ""How"" is a questioning word, and the response is an informational statement. The speaker wants to know how to fix a broken leg.

"
346,how long will you be out of class?,"

""how"" is an information word, so question is the most likely classification. 
the question mark at the end of that sentence indicates that the speaker is asking a follow-up question

based on your explanation, I agree that question most closely matches the classification of dialogue acts in this example.

"
347,i should be able to return by next monday.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the response is concluding a discussion that took place before (i.e. 'next mondy').

"
348,"fine. well, thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent. i hope you feel better soon.","

the text is not a question but a statement of fact, so inform is the correct classification;
based on your interpretation of what the author is asking, it is more likely a command than a query; and
it is possible that the writer is simply being polite and does not intend for the reader to classify the act as directive.

"
349,good afternoon! did you call for a plumber?,"

Question is a sub-type ofinform, and the main verb in the sentence is asked. So the answer is that the question is about whether the caller has called for someone to do a task, namely to call a plumbers. 
  

However, it is not a direct request for assistance. The person asking the questions is asking a follow up question. If the call was for service, then the service person would be expected to assist the customer. But the actual request is for information, so the response should be to inform the asker that a serviceperson is needed.

"
350,"yes, yes i did. please come in! i ’ m so glad you came! this old house is falling apart! come on into the bathroom. see, here, there ’ s water leaking everywhere!","

Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both transitive verbs, so the correct tense of these verbs is the infinitive form. However, inform is used in the present tense, while the question verb requires the past tense. Therefore, overinform. 
  
Question:  The text uses the word “question” as a verb, which requires a past form tense in English. In addition, “the” is not used before a noun, and the subject of “asking” a “query” in a conversation is almost always a human being. Based on these clues, we can conclude that “what” about “The chicken” was asked in this conversation.  

"
351,"i see. let me have a look. it seems that your toilet is clogged, and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush. let me just get my plunger. no, that ’ s not working either. i suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage. that ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow.","

Because the dialogue acts of the example text are all inform. The speaker does not ask a direct question or make a request, they are providing factual information.

"
352,"oh, that must be because of my four - year - old daughter. she is always flushing things down the toilet. you know how kids are.","

overinform: the sender is over-informing the receiver, asking too many questions
question: there is a lack of information in the message, so the question is used to seek more information
directive: this is an order, telling the other person what to do
commissive : this means to communicate a feeling or emotion, and commissives are often used in a negative context

A:
According to your explanation, it seems that the classification of the dialogue acts is correct. The inform is the most common, followed by question and directive.

"
353,"yeah, i have a little one myself. anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed. thatcould be causing water to not drain completely, that might lead to more problems in the future. i would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly. i could have it all finished by today if it ’ s urgent.","

Directive is a characteristic of asking a questions. The sentence ""These water  pipes arereally rustic, and they should also be replaced"" indicates the writer is asking the reader for details. 
Question is another characteristic that directive has. ""Does that mean they are broken?"" is an example of a direct question. 
  Directives are used to give instructions.  ""Clean the pipes and replace them"" is giving a  instruction.

"
354,that would be great! is it expensive?,"

Question is a dialogueact that is used to ask a direct question to the listener. In this case, ""courage"" is the question. The question mark indicates that the speaker is not sure of the answer and is looking for confirmation from the hearer. 
  
Out of question and question are both dialogueacts that are used when the information provided is ambiguous or incomplete. Out of doubt can also be used instead of questioning when there is no question but rather uncertainty.

"
355,let ’ s see... i would say about eight hundred dollars.,"

John Sandalls is mentioned in the first person, so it seems like he is the one asking the question. 
It doesn’t ask any questions, but it does give information. 
  Sure, John sandalls.

"
356,"listen, karen, i need your help. i don't know anyone here yet.","

Directive is a special type of question that is used to request a
specific action be taken. In this case, Karen is being asked to help
the speaker find a place to eat. 
  
Out of the four options, only question and directive are used with
requesting action. The other options are for requesting information
or giving advice.

"
357,i'm glad to help you. what's wrong?,"

In this example, inform is not the most likely dialogueact, as the information provided is about a health issue that the recipient of the message is likely to have some expertise in. In addition, there is no request for advice from this recipient, so question is also unlikely. 
  
  Directive is unlikely, because the sender is sharing information, not asking the receiver for action. Commissive would be unlikely because there isn't any mention of a cost or benefit of any kind.

"
358,my mother - in - law just went into the hospital in l. a. hank and i will be flying there tonight.,"

In this example, inform is the correct dialogue action because it provides the information that the reader needs to make an informed decision. The text does neither ask any question nor give any command. Instead, it simply provides useful information. 
  
  Inform (Over Question, Question, Directive, Commissive)

"
359,i'm sorry to hear it. what's wrong with her?,"

""Surely"" is a modal verb that can indicate certainty or probability. It can also be used as an adverb to express opinion or a suggestion. Based on this, ""Sure"" might indicate that the speaker is seeking clarification or confirmation from the hearer. 
  
  The phrase could also mean that something bad has happened to the lady in question. In this case, it is not clear whether the question is asked by the person or the dialogue acts of the sentence are commissives.

"
360,"doctors aren't sure yet. but the real problem is suzy. she has a bad cold, and we don't want to take her with us. but we don't know who can stay with her.","

Inform is the default dialogue action for statements that provide information. The statement ""I have the flu"" is informative, as is ""The flu has gone around the office"", and ""It's cold outside"". 
  
  In contrast, questions, directives, promises, orders, apologies, etc. require a different response.

"
361,you need a babysitter.,"

the text suggests the need for a childcare provider, and
it is likely that the person asking for help is a parent looking for child care for their children. In this case, it would make sense for them to be asking the question if anyone could be dispatched to look after their child.

"
362,"yes, i'd ask jill, the girl i've had before, but i need someone overnight. maybe even for two nights.","

overinform: the dialogue acts inform and overinform are used when the context does not allow for a clear classification. For example, inform overinform may be used to indicate that a statement is not important or does matter, and therefore should not be overstated. 
  
question: question is used in place of direct speech when a character is asking another for information or advice. The character may also ask another question if they need to confirm or understand something. However, if a question seems odd or unnatural, it is more likely that it should be classified under commissives instead.

"
363,i could have suzy stay at my place.,"

directive is the correct classification as the given apology is aimed at preventing a repetition of the mistake. 
overinform is not applicable as there is no question in this passage. 
  
question is out of scope as this is a statement of fact not a request for information.  

"
364,"i don't want to do that to you, karen.","

This text is a commissives because it is asking the listener not to take the pictures.

"
365,why not?,"

Question is a sub-class ofinform that is used to probe for information, typically in a conversational context. 
  
Examples of questions include: ""What time is it?"" ""Where is the nearest gas station?"" and ""Are you hungry?"". In contrast, inform is typically used for general communication, such as in an email or letter.

"
366,your own kids would get suzy's cold. i think it would be better to have a good babysitter here. but i don't know who to ask. i need someone more mature than jill. it might even be for two or three days.,"

Overinform: This dialogueact is used when the information provided is too much. 
  For example, if a person says ""i'm going to the store"", and the person who is listening to this message says, ""why are you going?"", then the overinform dialogue acts would likely be used: ""what do you mean?"" and ""stop telling me what to think!"". In this case, it is better for the listener to say, simply, that they are going, and then explain what they mean. 
Question: If the inform dialogue action is not enough, another dialogue is likely used to find out more information. For example: if the first person said ""going to store"" and a second person asks ""where are we going?"", then a questioning dialogue would probably be the most appropriate one. ""to store?"". The person would then respond with the name of the place, for example ""the store"". 
 Directive: A directive dialogue can be seen when someone is giving orders. If someone says to ""take a shower"", then it's likely that a directive action will be taken. A person giving commands is also likely to use a direct dialogue. An example of a similar text to that of ""who is going with you?"" is ""we need to go to a meeting, can you come?"" In that case the directive would most likely apply.

 commissIVE: Commissive actions are used for making promises. So, in this example if someone said, “i’m going shopping with my friends”, then commissives are likely being used. “we’ll go shopping” or “you’re going too far”.

"
367,"i know who we can ask. there is a girl i know, sara ralston. she is 17, and she will usually take this kind of job. i know her from my church, and i trust her completely.","

overinform: Sara r alston is not a 17-year-old girl. She is 47 years old. Furthermore, she does not take jobs from strangers on Tinder. 
  
question: Who is Sara Ralstons? 
directive: Put your hand behind you head. 

 

 commissIVE: I know Sara and I trust Sara. Therefore, I will ask Sara if she can help us with this job

"
368,"i'd like to talk with her. this is short notice, i know. but hank and i are leaving tonight.","

This text indicates the request for information from a third party. The
sender is not seeking confirmation or approval from this third-party
party, but rather is providing information to that party to help that
third party make a decision. In this case, it is the third person who is
leaving tonight that is being informed. 
  

A:
According to the GPT-3 model, this message is a request to confirm the room rate.

"
369,i'll get you her number. i hope she can do it. she is very responsible.,"

inform is a good choice for this dialogueact, as the information provided is not important, but rather just more information. 
question is another good option, because the question is about the other information that is being requested. However, it is important to note that this is an interrogative sentence, and not a declarative one. Therefore, this choice is less likely to be correct.

"
370,i'm glad you know someone. i knew you would be the best person to ask about this. i don't want to insult jill or her mother. i think jill maybe could do it. but i'd rather have someone a little older.,"

Overinform: the car could be stuck in a jam for hours. 
Question: why is the traffic so bad?  Why is it taking so long to get to the store?
Directive: you should have called the office to find out the time. You should not have left it to chance. 
  You could have been stuck there for three days.  
Commissive (sometimes used as a substitute for directive): i'm going to call the company and find the answer. I'm not going anywhere until I find an answer!

I'm sure you will do a great job.

"
371,i'll go home and get sara's number. i'll call her first myself.,"

Out of question: the sentence does provide a reason, but it does so implicitly, by way of sharing an explanatory statement. 
  
  In question : the question is implied by the statement provided, and it is not clear whether the information provided is intended to answer the implied question. 
Directive: although the first part of that sentence is about getting Sara's phone number, it could also be interpreted as a command, directing the listener to do something.

"
372,great. then call me and let me know if she's free.,"

Directive is the most general dialogueact, and is associated most often with giving orders or requests. 
  Inform is an intermediate dialogueAct, typically used to provide information about the future or the present. Question is used for questioning information, either to check for accuracy or to confirm a suspicion. Directive can also be used as a way to emphasize a point or make a request. Commissive means to commit or bind oneself to something.

"
373,good evening. what'll you have?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to ask someone a direct question. ""What'll
you have?"" is a simple question that can be used in many different
situations. In this example, it's likely that the person asking the question is asking about the order of drinks at the bar. 
  
Overinform dialogue Acts are similar to questions, but instead of asking a
question, they inform the listener of something. This can include a fact,
an opinion, a recommendation, etc. The inform dialogue act in this
example, ""the sound,"" is likely being used as a way to inform this person
that the jukebox at this bar is playing a specific song.

"
374,i'd like a beer. what kind of beer do you have?,"

the text is asking for a specific type of beverage, suggesting a plan of conversation that may lead to a decision to be made
it is an informational request, as the other party is providing the information, but not seeking it
this is another example of the commissives, where the speaker is seeking information from the hearer, and is not providing it.

"
375,draft beer and cans beer. which do you prefer?,"

'beer and beer' can both be understood as a plural noun, so the question is about which of the two is preferred. 
In English, we often use question words when we are seeking clarification. For example, 'are you sure?', 'what do they mean?'. In this case, it is likely that 'beers' is the correct answer, as it would be more natural to ask 'which beer would you recommend?'.

"
376,a draft beer please.,"

In the example provided, it is not clear whether the person is giving information or asking a question. The use of the word please suggests the latter, so the dialogue acts in this example would be question and directive. 
  
If the information is being offered, then the offer is made freely, and the directive act makes an instruction or offer of service.

"
377,ok. here you are.,"

This text provides the speaker with information that the listener finds useful. The speaker is conveying that they can tolerate a smoky environment, but the environment is not suitable for thelistener. This is a request for information, and the information provided is useful to the recipient.

"
378,could i have some fruit?,"

This text is asking for some fruits. The speaker does not provide information, ask a query, or direct someone for a task. Instead, they are directing another person to provide something to them.

"
379,"of course. wait for a moment, please.","

This text is asking a follow-up question after being told what for. This is characteristic behavior of commissives. 
  
However, this is also seeking clarification, a feature of questions. Therefore, it is classified here as a commissIVE.

"
380,"hello, mr. black, how are you?","

I think the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the person is being questioned. The person being asked is ""how are YOU?"". Based on this, I would classify this as a direct question or a commissivo. 
  
However, if the dialogue acts were classified based on only the last word of a sentence, then I think this would be classified more as an informational question: ""How are You?"" is a neutral question that does not indicate who is answering it. It could be a generic question about how one is feeling.

"
381,"fine, thank you, and how are you?","

Question is the most likely dialogueact because of the use of ""can i"" in the first sentence. This is an indication that the questioner is attempting to determine if the onlooker needs assistance. 
  
Out of Inform: ""goodevening"" is not a greeting. It is used to introduce a sentence that is meant to be a conversation. 
question is also the next most common dialogueAct, because it is possible that this person is simply being polite and offering help. However, it would be unusual for a person to offer help without being asked for it. Therefore, this sentence indicates that a request for assistance was made.

"
382,"very well, thank you. it's nice to meet you again. i am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport, as i was busy yesterday. i do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from new york.","

This text indicates the speakers are giving information. The inform act indicates a speaker is providing or sharing information to another person. 
  
  The text ""i dohope youhad avery enjoyabletrip fromnew yORK"" is the question mark. It's a way of asking another question. ""Do you hope that I had an enjoyable travel from New York?"". So the inform dialogue acts are not applicable here. 
However, if the second person is an employee, then the directive dialogueact may be applicable. In this case, it would be ""Please give me my Bill.""

"
383,"yes, a very pleasant journey indeed. thank you.","

inform: this is not a question or a request, it is just a statement of fact. 
question: is this a suggestion or an order?
directive: yes, this appears like an instruction or suggestion to purchase some marijuana
 commissIVE: no, I don't think so, but I could be wrong. 
  This text does not appear to indicate a clear direction or request for the buyer to take any action.

"
384,how are you getting along with your business?,"

This text is in the question dialogueact because it starts off with ""how"" which is a question word. The next sentence ""are you"" is also a prepositional phrase that is followed immediately by a verb ""getting along"" so it is possible that the writer is seeking confirmation or information from this person.

"
385,"not bad. the fur market is not very brisk lately, but the selling season is advancing near. i hope there will be more buyers in the market this year.","

the text provided information to the user about a distant location and the estimated travel duration. 
It does neither ask questions, make commands, nor make commitments.

"
386,"i hope we can do more business together. though we are satisfied with our past trade record, there are still possibilities for more business. in the meantime, let's discuss other spheres of cooperation, such as investment, technology transfer and technical assistance.","

Directive is a dialogueact that is used to make requests or orders. The word 'order' is capitalized in this sentence because it is being used as a noun. Directive can be used in a sentence like this: ""Please order the driver to turn right at the next traffic light.""

In this example, 'Please turn the right turn signal on at your vehicle's dashboard.' is the directive sentence. 
  
Out of: inform question directive commissIVE
ofcourse, I do. | 'I hope that we could do business more in future.' | directive | out of | inform | question | direct | order | commissïve |
This text is using the dialogue acts of directive.

"
387,"by the way miss, where is the toilet?","

In this example, 'where is' is a question word. Based on this, we can predict that the person asking is likely interested in finding the answer to this question. Therefore, it is classified here as 'question'.

Note that this is just a prediction, and you should verify it with the actual dialogue model to confirm.

"
388,"toilets are in the rear, i am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment.","

This text provides information to the listener about a missing piece of information. The speaker is giving advice on how the other person can improve. This is a commissIVE dialogueact.

"
389,"what? oh, what we live! thank you very much for your help, miss.","

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the phrase, ""oh, tell,"" indicates the information is being provided. However, it is also possible that question or directive could be applied, depending on how the conversation continues.

"
390,you are welcome.,"

Inform (or Inform) is a non-verbal behavior used to provide information to another person. 
Out of Informat, Question, Directive, Commissive are the possible dialogue acts for Informing.

"
391,"excuse me, could you tell me which line i ’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package?","

In English, a command is a type of directive that involves telling someone what to do. The command form of the verb tell is tell (verb), which means to convey information to a person or a group of people. In this case, it is the person standing in line that is being told what action to take. 
  
  The text suggests that you are supposed stand at a certain line to purchase bubblewrap and post the package. Based on this, we can predict that this is an order, and the directive dialogueact is most likely to be used.

"
392,"you can buy the bubble wrap here, but you ’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage.","

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the answer to the question requires the information that the sender is seeking. The sender asks if the receiver is busy, and the response requires that they know whether the person is currently busy or not. 
  

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible answers to a ""are-you-busy"" question: 
1. No, I am not busy.  2. Yes, I am busy now. 3. I’m busy right now, so I can’t answer right now. 4. Sorry, can you repeat the question?

"
393,that ’ s a really long line. how long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people?,"

Question is a dialogueact that is used to ask for information or clarification. The question mark at the end of the sentence indicates that the author is uncertain about something. 
  
  In this sentence, ""how long"" is the question. ""Do you  think it will take"" indicates the answer is going to be a statement, not a clarification of a previous question from the reader.

"
394,"it takes about 3 minutes per person, so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait.","

In this example, inform is the correct classification as the statement provides the receiver with information, not asking or giving orders. 
  
  Out of the four classification options, this is one of only two examples where the classification is inform. The other example is where a person is told that they have “ one hour left ”. This is considered to be question in the other classification option, but inform in this case.

"
395,can i buy stamps here?,"

Directive is the correct classification because this is a directive from the person providing the information that we can’t go any faster if the car is going that speed. 
  
Question is not a correct dialogueact classification, because there is no question in the provided text. 
Out of the four options, only question and directive are possible. Question is only possible if you are asking for information, and a direct order is possible only if there was a previous conversation about the order.

"
396,sure. how many would you like?,"

Question is a sub-type ofinform. Question is used to ask a specific question to a human being. In this case, it is asking for a number of responses. 
Overinform is another sub type of question. It is using too much information to the point that the person receiving the information does not have time to process it and ask questions. 
  In this example, too many details are being provided and the receiver doesnot have the time or the mental capacity to understand it.  
Directive is the third type. Directive words are used when you want to convey a strong message to another person. This message can be to change their behavior or to make a request.   
Commissive  is the fourth type and is often used in business situations. Commissive verbs are those that are related to making promises or commitments.

"
397,i need 30 for my christmas cards.,"

""i have book a aroom for the 24"" indicates that the speaker is providing information. This is a characteristic trait of ""the inform"" act, as opposed to ""question"" or ""command"" acts. 
  ""for my cards"" is an example of information being shared, not asked for. The ""share"" information act ""tell""

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible dialogue acts for a text: question (q), command (c), directive (d), and inform(in).  The inform act includes the following sub-acts: overinform, inquire, direct, command.  
In your example, ""i booked the room 24 for christmass cards"", the inform dialogue is the most appropriate.

"
398,are you sending them abroad?,"

Are you send them overseas? is a question that is typically used when someone is asking a follow-up question to an initial question. In this case, it is likely that the person asking the question is interested in the answer to whether or not you are sending someone abroad. If the response is no, then the follow up question would be why not.

"
399,twenty of them are going abroad to china and america.,"

inform is the first dialogueact in this context. It is used to provide information when the other options are not sufficient. In this case, there are other ways to ask for the information. So inform is not appropriate. 
question is another option. However, it is only used when there is a lack of information, and we need to find out more. This text does not have a need for more information and so question is an unlikely option here. 
  
Question: Do you know the man with the white beard?
Answer: I do not. I haven't read the book.

"
400,"do you have any going anywhere in the eu? if you do, those are less expensive.","

Question: do you  have any  going anywhere  in the  eu?  If you
  do,  those are  less expensive

In this context, ""question"" is used in a broader sense than its usual meaning of a request for information. The question can also be used to express doubt, uncertainty, and even anger. In this case, it is likely that the speaker is asking a follow-up question to the previous statement, but is not entirely sure of the answer.

"
401,no.,"

This text is a reply to the offer of a drink, and the person declining the drink is clearly providing reasons why they don't want to drink it, i.e. their preferences. This is an example of an informative reply.

"
402,"ok, here you go. that will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence.","

 commissives are often used to influence or guide the behavior of the other person. They are typically used in requests or commands. 
  

A request or command is typically a commissIVE dialogue action. Requests or Commands are used when you want someone to perform an action on your behalf. For example, you might ask someone for a favor, or tell someone what to DO. Commandoes are also used as a polite way to tell another person to stop doing something.

"
403,and the bubble wrap?,"

Question: the dialogue acts question and question are the same, but they have different intents. Question is used to ask a direct question to the reader. Inform is a polite response to information received from another source. The question in this example is not asking the question of whether people enjoy drinking tea from Europe to Asia. Instead, it is asking another question. 
Directive: this is the most serious type of dialogue action. This is when the speaker is giving instructions to someone else. For example, ""Do as I say, not what I do."" Commissive is another type a directive action, where the person giving the directive is also asking for something in return. ""If you do X, then I will Y.""

"
404,that ’ s another quid.,"

‘what else’s sources’ could be considered a clarification, but it could also be seen as a request for clarification as it leaves it up to the reader to supply the missing information.

"
405,thanks a lot. you ’ ve been very helpful.,"

Statements where a speaker acknowledges a fact or a state of affairs and expresses an expression of regret or an admission of fault. 
  
  Statments where an agent acknowledges the knowledge of a propositional content and states that they are aware of it.

"
406,"good evening, saliva. what's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen? what are you doing now?","

Question is a dialogue-act type that indicates that the speaker is seeking information from the listener. In this case, we can see that this is the narrator seeking more information, and the information provided is what prompted the classification of the dialogue as a  question. 
  
Inform is another dialogue action type. It is used when the message is already known and does not require further explanation. This is likely the case here, as the reader is familiar with what the author is doing in the kitchen.

"
407,i am cooking now!,"

inform: this is a request for general information, not a command or a
request for a specific action. 
question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates
that the speaker is unsure of something, and is therefore asking a 	question. 
	The question is likely to be answered with information provided in the previous sentence.

"
408,are you good at cooking?,"

Question: are you a good cook? 
Inform: No, I am not a great cook. I enjoy cooking, but I'm not great at it. 



A:

I think the answer is that the question is a declarative statement, and the rest are questions.

"
409,"i have studied its skills recently at a training school. i plan to run a restaurant, so i have to practise cooking!","

overinform: this is asking for information, but the information is already provided in the previous sentence.

question: the person is evaluating my performance. 
  
directly: i should follow the instructor's instructions. 
commisively: if i don't practice, i will not be able to cook well.

"
410,it is a good idea. what dish are you cooking now?!,"

Question is used when the information provided is not sufficient to answer the question and the asker is looking for confirmation or clarification. 
In this case, it is likely that the user is interested in knowing what the chef is cooking at the moment. The chef may not be aware of the request and may be busy. In this situation, a simple question like this one could be enough to get the answer.

"
411,i am steaming fish in a pressure cooker. have you ever tried steamed fish?,"

Question: have  you ever  tried steamer fish?

In this context, steamers are types of heat-retentive cooking vessels. The fish is a living thing, so it is considered commissIVE. However, it does require some heat to cook it, and a steamboat is not a good way to do that. So, a person would use a pot or pressure-cooker to achieve the same effect. 
  
  Inform: Yes, we have used a  pressure cooker to prepare steame fish. We found it to be very effective.

"
412,"yes, i have. but the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious. the fish is not well - done and too salty.","

the text provided information on how many items are available in each of 6 rooms. This indicates sharing or providing information. 
it does ask questions, make promises, and give instructions, all of which would be characteristic of question.

"
413,that's the case. i think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much.,"

the text shares information, not a direct question or command
it is informational in character, sharing information rather then asking for a specific action

In summary, this is a directive text.

"
414,i have the same idea as yours.,"

Overinform: This is a strong warning to the listener to stop what they are doing and pay attention. This type of dialogue is often used in radio or TV commercials to get your attention and make you do something. 
  
Question: this is the first step in a conversation. The person asking the question is trying to find out something about the other person. They are usually looking for information to help them make an educated decision. 
Directive:  This is an order to do or not to  do something, it usually comes from a higher authority. For example, ""stop what you are currently doing"" or ""go to work""
Committive : This dialogue acts are used to make promises or commitments.  For example ""I will do that""  or ""that will happen"".

"
415,it's ok. please have a taste of it.,"

In this example, inform is not the most appropriate dialogue tag, as the statement does not provide any information. It is a factual statement, so the dialogue acts of question and directive are not applicable. Furthermore, it is neither a question nor a directive. Finally, Commissive is also not a suitable dialogue action, because the rest of the sentence does provide further instructions. Therefore, a commissIVE dialogue is unlikely here.

"
416,"thank you. oh, it's very delicious.","

This text indicates the ingredients the chef will use, which is a directive action. 
However, there is also the possibility that this is just a recommendation or suggestion from the cook. In this case, we would expect the response to be more informational (inform,question,directive,informative).

"
417,thank you for your praise.,"

the text ""oh so does i."" is not asking a questions, giving commands, making promises, etc. and therefore the dialogue acts are over-classified asinform
without revealing this dialogue-act prediction, I can say that the ""so do I."" part is just expressing agreement with what was said before, and that is what ""inform"" dialogue Acts are about.

"
418,"besides steamed fish, what else are you good at cooking?","

steamedfish is a good food.

While it may be true that fish is good, it does not answer the question of what other foods the person is particularly good or bad at. 
  
  Based off of the provided text and the surrounding context, this person seems to be particularly bad with cooking other than steaming fish.

"
419,"i am good at stewing beef with potato, frying chicken, hot and sour soup etc.","

inform: over inform
question: question
directive: directive
commissive : commissve

"
420,"so many dishes. next friday week is my birthday. i would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party, ok?","

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to express orders, suggestions, and recommendations. In this case, it is likely that Directive was used because the person giving the information is suggesting that you cook a dish for their birthday in return for which you will be rewarded with a birthday gift.

"
421,why not? it is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking.,"

the text does provide an answer or statement indicating the information is shared, but it does so as a comment rather than as the main conversation
it is not a direct question as it asks for a reason, rather it directs the answer to another person
as a commissIVE, it indicates that a decision needs to be made, and the person speaking is making a recommendation or request

Note that this is just a explanation, not the full answer.

"
422,thanks a lot.,"

the text does provide information, therefore the classification is correct. 
without revealing this classification, other people might classify the same text in a different way, and therefore not understand the meaning of the conversation.

"
423,it's my pleasure.,"

inform is a generic label that can be applied to any of the four dialogue acts. In this case, inform is the most appropriate label, because the intention of asking the question is to get information. 
question is another generic dialogue-act label. It can also be used to describe a request for information, but in this example it is more likely that question was used because of its ambiguity with the preceding inform. 
 question: I wonder if it's longer...
directive: let's take another look
 commissitive: no, let’s not do that. Let me look first.

"
424,room service. what can i do for you?,"

Question: is this a general question or is it more specific? The question is about a strategy or a plan of action. It is not about the food itself. 
Inform: I am looking for a recommendation or advice on how to stick with only a certain foods. 
  Question : What can you suggest? 
   Directive: Please continue to eat only the foods listed.  
    commissitive: please continue eating only these foods

A:
According to your explanation, it is a more general and general questions.

"
425,this is room 2012. where is my laundry? you promised to send to me this morning.,"

Question asks for further information. 
In this case, it is unclear from the given statement whether the sender of the laundry is asking for more information or simply stating a fact. The sender is not seeking details or asking the recipient for confirmation. Therefore, this is a question. 
  
Overinform: the statement is also an answer, so the question is redundant. Inform is the correct dialogue action.

"
426,"well, let me check for you. i am sorry, sir. they mistook your order as a normal one. actualty it's an express laundry, is that right?","

the text asks a follow-up question to confirm the details of the order, and the answer to the question requires more information from both the sender and receiver. 
in addition, this is a request for confirmation, so it is classified here as directive.

"
427,"yes, i ordered the express service.","

Inform is a less specific form of question than question and thus is more general than the question in the example. 
question is the most specific of the four options and is thus the best choice as the correct answer.

"
428,"sir, we are terribly sorry for that. we will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room 3 hours later. is that all right?","

This text asks the customer service representative if they can provide assistance in refunding the service charge. The customer representative can offer assistance by providing information or by taking a directive action, such as issuing a command or offering a suggestion. 
  
  The text indicates the assistance can come from a direction or action on behalf of the sender, so the response should be a recommendation or suggestion from customer services.

"
429,that's fine.,"

This text seems to be asking about something that is potentially a problem, so it is commissively asking.

"
430,i'd like you to do me a favor.,"

It can considered directive text because is telling the person not do something in future, it does not provide information or ask question. 
In contrast, other classes of dialogue acts include:
- question: asking question
  - inform: providing  information

A:

              Based   on   the   text,   it   is   a   directive.   Without   revealing   predicted   dialogue   act   label,  explain  why:   The text  can   be   considered   as   giving   instructions   or   advice   to   recipient,    telling   them   not   do   something.    It   also   does   Not provide   information, ask   question,     or    make   promise    or  commitment,      which   are   characteristics   of   other   classes.

"
431,what is it?,"

the given statement is not a statement, but a confirmation of a previous statement

yes you have, I already told you before that you can ask any question you want here.

"
432,can you mail this at the post office for me? i have to go to the doctor for an appointment and i don't have enough time to go to the post office.,"

In the example provided, it is clear that ""sir"" is the addressee of whom the message is being sent. The addressees name ""doctor"" does not appear in the context of a conversation between ""you"" and ""him"", so it can be inferred that there is no context for ""i don’t have time"" to apply to ""the doctor"". Hence, ""for the appointment"" can also be applied to both ""I have an appt with the doc"" (for which you have the time) and to this example, where ""appt"" refers to an ""appointment with a doctor"" which ""he"" has to attend. Hence the sentence can either be rephrased as ""can I mail it to him for the appts with doctor?"" or as the classification suggests, as simply ""Can you email this to me for your appointment with Dr?"".

"
433,sure. and i'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's.,"

Directive is the most likely dialogue acts for this message, since it is seeking information and direction from another party. The recipient of the message is also a potential source of information, so the sender is implicitly asking the receiver to provide the information. 
In addition, this is an example of a conversational question that is often used in a directive form. For example, when asking a waiter for the check, a customer might say something like ""Do you have the bill?"". In this case, ""the bill"" is likely to be the waiter's, but it could also be a restaurant's or a service's bill.

"
434,"excuse me, may i help you?","

This text indicates the person asking the question is trying to help the other person. Therefore, it is a request for information, and not a statement.

"
435,would you please fill some gas for me?,"

Inform: This is not a directive dialogue, so this label is unnecessary. 
Question: the question mark indicates the speaker is unsure of the answer, and the gas part is a possible answer. Therefore, this is considered a questioning dialogue. 
  
Directive: this word is used to indicate that a person or organization is telling someone or something what to do. In this case, it is the other person who is being told to fill the tank. So this dialogue is classified here.

"
436,sure. which kind of gas do you want?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to find out information or learn about something. In this case, it's trying find the gas type. The question is therefore informational. 
  
Overinform dialogue Acts are attempts to give too much information. This is a common mistake made by new users. It's important to provide only the information needed to complete the task at hand. Here, ""what kind gas"" is not needed for the response. Therefore, this part of the dialogue is overinform. 
Quotation dialogueacts are an attempt to paraphrase or summarize something, usually to convince someone of something or to persuade someone to do something (commissive dialogueact). In the example provided, there is no need to quote or paraphrasen the question. Instead, simply provide the answer that is needed. ""Gas type"" fits this description.

"
437,"unleaded, please.","

over question: the question is about the family rather than about something specific to myself, so it is an information request
question: I don't know the answer to this question
directive: tell us about yourself
commissive (also known as commiss): I will tell you about my family

In summary, based on this passage, I predict the dialogue acts to be inform and directive.

"
438,ok.,"

This text is suggesting an offer or option, and the receiver is expected to accept it. This is a commissIVE statement. 
  
  The receiver of such a statement should not be surprised if the offer is accepted. The receiver has already been given the option of accepting or rejecting the offered gift. Therefore, it would be inappropriate for the sender to add a further requirement that the acceptance be done immediately.

"
439,i'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports.,"

Directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used to tell someone what to do. In this case, it's used as a request to talk to the user about financing our exports. 
Question is another type of directive act. It's a seek information from a person type act, so the question makes sense here. The person asking for information is also asking a follow up question. 
  
Out of Inform: This is an inform act which is used when you are giving information to someone. Here, there is no question of asking the other person to perform a task, instead it is just giving the information. So this is out of the dialogue.

"
440,it can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight.,"

Inform is a directive dialogue action that is used when the sender is providing information to a recipient. In this example, it seems like the author is suggesting a possible choice to make by the receiver. This is why it falls under directive. 
  
Question is another directive action used to express a request for information. The author seems be asking the reader if they are interested or interested them in the red rose offer. Since the question is asked to another person, this is considered a question. It falls into this category because of its request nature.

"
441,what about a draft at 120 days sight?,"

This text is asking the user for a recommendation or suggestion. The user is likely being asked to provide input or feedback on a proposed project. This is a characteristic directive dialogue. 
  
In contrast, if the response is provided, then the dialogue acts would be: question: what about the draft?; question; what is the deadline? and question. In this case, all three questions are informational and not directive: the users are being provided with information, not being guided towards specific topics or decisions.

"
442,all right. but we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us.,"

In this example, we can see that the 'we' in the first sentence is a third person pronoun, and the rest of dialogue acts are thirdperson. So the directive dialogueact is the only one that fits here.

"
443,a bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports. you can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due.,"

This text is providing specific details about a cost, and therefore is classified inform. The bank is not asking a direct question or making a promise, so it's likely that the bank will not add an extra cost to our import.

"
444,then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank. you know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible.,"

Directive dialogue acts are used when the main purpose of the conversation is to give orders or make requests. In this case, ""you know"" is used to confirm that you have heard the question correctly. 
  
overinform: this is a negative response. the response does not provide enough information to understand the original question
question: the person asking the questions is looking to find out information, so the dialogueact of question is the most appropriate
directive: ""then"" indicates a command, and ""we"" are the one who should arrange a bank loan. ""You"" should not be involved in this process. 
 commissives: since the order is for the bank to make a decision, then the commissivedirective is appropriate.

"
445,i hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries.,"

Directive is a special type of question that is used to request a favor or to make a polite request. 
  
  In this example, 'please' is the directive word. It indicates the need for the listener to do something, such as help the sender, or do the favor requested by the receiver.

"
446,so do i.,"

Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the most appropriate. Inform is used to describe a person providing information to another person. This is a good use of information in this context, as the person is sharing that they are not a very comfortable public speaker and are trying to practice to increase their business skills.

"
447,"there's a new girl in school, have you seen her yet?","

In this example, ""have you ever seen this girl?"" is classified
as question. The question mark indicates a request for a
response. ""Have you [ever] seen the girl?,"" is a more direct
question, but still implies that a response is expected. 
  
""Have You EVER SEEN THE GIRL?"" implies a strong urgency,
which is unusual for question question in the dialogues of
common speech.

"
448,i haven't seen her yet.,"

In this example,'may i' is an interrogative word, and the response is a directive. The speaker wants someone else to let them see the person they are talking to.

"
449,i think that she is very pretty.,"

Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both transitive verbs, and inform is used in a non-restrictive sense, so it can also be used as a noun, as in ""I know a lot of things"").
Question:  The text uses the question word ""question"" twice in the passage, once at beginning of first sentence and again at end. This indicates that this is the expected question in this context. 
  Based off the context, it seems like the person is asking a direct question. 
Directive: ""But what if the chickens don't like it?"" indicates the author is expecting a directive response.  
 commissives: commissIVE is an adjective that can be added to a transative verb to form a new transactive verb. In this case, 'question' becomes 'questioned'.  So, in answer to the direct query, she 'questions' the taste of chicken.

"
450,tell me how she looks.,"

directive is the most likely dialogueact given the context of the message. The asker is seeking information about how the person they are speaking to looks, so it is most like they will be told. 
question is less likely, since the askers is not seeking any information, but rather is posing a direct question. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think that your text contains a directive dialogue. Please check the following: 

 

Directive dialogue is used when the speaker wants to get something done. For example, you are going to a party and you want to meet some people. You can use directive to ask someone you know to invite you.

"
451,she's kind of short.,"

It provides detailed information to the receiver about a specific aspect of the conversation. 
In particular, it provides the specific cost for a single night's stay. 
  This type of information is typically shared between two parties who are communicating with each other.

"
452,what height is she?,"

Question is a sub-class of question-response dialogue acts. The question label is only used when the dialogue partner asks a direct, specific question that does NOT provide enough information to be answered by providing only the information that was asked for. For example, if the question is ""How tall is the person?"", the answer to that question would be ""She is about 5 feet 10 inches."" However, a more general question such as ""What is it like living in New York?"" would not be classified a ""question"" because the response to this question does provide specific information (i.e. ""It is very crowded and noisy"").

In this example the statement provided in the passage is not a general statement that can be easily answered with only a specific piece of information. Therefore, ""she"" is being asked a 'question' and the 'how tall' part of the sentence is part a directive.

"
453,she's probably about five feet.,"

Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the most appropriate. The first sentence of your example text provides information, not a request for information. In the second sentence, it is clear that the speaker is asking for confirmation or clarification, as the listener is expected to provide an answer. However, in the third sentence the information is shared, so inform seems appropriate, although it could also be classified in question or directive. Finally, Commissive is unlikely, since the writer is clearly making an offer or commitment.

"
454,"that's nice, but tell me what she looks like.","

She looks nice is not seeking or expecting information. It is stating a fact. 
Question: What she look like?
Directive: Say whatshe lookslike.

"
455,the first thing i noticed was her beautiful brown eyes.,"

Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the most polite. 
  It conveives information without making a request or commitment, and without posing a direct question.

"
456,i think i might've bumped into her before.,"

In the example text provided, there is a strong indication that the request is for the listener to take possession of an item on their behalf. The use of ""can"" and the context of a conversation between two people strongly suggest that this is an order, not a question. Additionally, ""I think I might’ve bump[en] into him before"" suggests that he is the person who bump(ed) into the other person, and not the reverse. 
  

Note that there are many ways to interpret the provided text. It is not possible to determine the correct classification of dialogue acts solely from the given text; however, this example does suggest a command or order.

"
457,are you telling me that you've seen her before?,"

Are you asking me if I've previously seen this person? This is an example of asking a simple yes/no question that is characteristic for a yes-no type question question type. 
  
If you are asking if this is the first time I have seen the person, then this would be an informational question as it is looking for background information.

"
458,i believe so.,"

inform: sender seeks to provide information to the receiver
question: receiver asks a direct question
directive: the speaker is directing the action of another person or entity
 commissIVE: speaker are asking for confirmation or approval from another

Note that inform and question are often used interchangeably in natural language processing, but inform is a more general term that can also refer to question in some contexts.

"
459,"take a seat inside and see what you think. so you will take the porsche then, sir?","

Question asks for a response. 
Overinform, because the first part of the sentence, ""oh so"", is not necessary to understand the rest of it. So, it is over-informative. 
  Question, inform
  Directive, ask
Commissive: I don't think so. The porscher is a car, not a horse.

"
460,"yes, and i want to buy the insurance too. i think it's necessary.","

Directive is a directive act, meaning that it is an instruction or order given to another person or entity. In this case, it refers to the person asking for information about how they can communicate in good English. 
  

Question is the first predicted act in this dialogue. The question marks at both ends of the sentence indicate that someone is trying to find information out from another. 
Out of Inform: This is where the information is being requested.  The text ""i want"" is indicating the need for the answer. ""to buy"" the ""insurance too"" indicates that this is something the receiver wants too, hence the question.

"
461,"you're smart to buy it. at 45 dollars for three days, it is a good deal.","

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the response is concluding a discussion that took place before, and the classification of the dialogue acts is provided.

"
462,can i return the car in san francisco?,"

Directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used to make an order or request. In this case, it is requesting that you return a car to a specific location. 
  
Question is an interrogative dialogueact used when a character is asking a clarifying question. The question in this example is ""can I return car"" which is followed by a response of ""yes"" or ""no"". 
   
Inform is used for general information. ""Sour and Peppermint"" is general descriptive information that can be used as a answer to any question and is not a request for clarification.

"
463,"san francisco? no, sir. we only have this office here. you will have to return it here.","

I think the answer is because the subject of the question is ""you"", and the response is from a third party. The response should be ""yes, I am busy"" from ""the recipient"".

A:
According to the Stanford Core Dialogue Act Model, your answer would be classified under question because you are asking a hypothetical question to a non-existing entity.

"
464,really? i heard in america you can return rental cars in different cities.,"

Question: ""Can I return the rental car in another city?""
Inform: No, you cannot return a rental vehicle in a different city. 
question: Why not?
Directive: Because the car is rented and the terms and conditions state that you must return it in the city you rented it from. 
 question: But I want to return in other cities!
Request: I'm afraid that's not possible. You must returned the rented car within the duration of the contract.

"
465,"no, sir. that's only with the very big companies. i'm sorry, but this car must be returned to this lot.","

inform is used when someone is giving information to another person. 
question is when a person is seeking information. 
  

In this case, it seems that the car is being returned because the owner is unhappy with it.

"
466,"well, i guess i will have to drive back down then. hmm. i didn't think of that.","

This text is asking the person to do something, so it is align with question dialogue acts. 
However, it does not give enough information to determine what the instructions are. It is possible that they want the listener to go to a specific website or look up a recipe, which would be directions.

"
467,"do you still want the car, sir?","

Question is a sub-class of Inform that is used to request information from the other person. In this case, a person is asking for the driver to still give the passenger a ride. 
  
Inform is the base class for all other dialogue acts. This includes question and directive. Both of these acts are used for providing general information to the receiver. For example, in the example above, informing the person that the ride is still available is one of the possible uses of question or inform. Directive is another type of dialogue action that can be used when you want to make an order to another person, but do not want it to appear as a request. Instead, it is more like a order. Commissive, on its own, is not a dialogue-action, however, when combined with another dialogue, such as directive or question can create a new type or dialogue.

"
468,yes. it will be fun. driving back down the coast. my girlfriend will like it.,"

Out of question: the speaker is not asking for confirmation or advice, so out of ask is the prediction. 
Question: although the question is possible, based on context it is more likely that this is a comment on how the driver should dress for driving in the summer. 
  
Over question : the information provided is too general, and does not provide enough detail to answer the query. In this case, it would be more accurate to classify this as over inform.

"
469,it's a beautiful drive.,"

Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the most likely. The text ""ihave no problems with"" is an acceptance of something. It is not a request for information, a query for opinion or a command.

"
470,where are the keys?,"

Question: the prediction was question mark, which indicates that the model is uncertain about something. In this case, it is unsure whether the provided information is correct or not. 
  
Overinform: this prediction is overinform, indicating that this model believes the information provided is too much. It is likely that providing too many details could cause the listener to miss something important. 
Questions: although the dialogue acts of the question and over-inform are similar, there is one key difference: over inform indicates the uncertainty of a statement, while question indicates uncertainty about a prediction. Therefore, this difference is the key to identifying the correct dialogue action.

"
471,"just a moment, sir. we have to finish filling out the forms.","

Directive acts are used to ask for something to be done or to give orders. In this case, ""just fill out this form"" is a directive act. 
  
Out of the four possible dialogue acts, Commissive is the only one that can be used when you are giving information. So in this example, it is likely that ""we have finished filling the form, but you have not yet received your prize"" would be a CommissIVE act, as the information is being given to the other person.

"
472,gary. could you type up this report for me? i have to take off early this afternoon.,"

Directives are statements that tell someone what to do. In this example, gary asks why he has to leave early. This is a directive because it tells gARY what he should do (leave early). 
  
Out of Inform: This text does not contain any information about what ggary needs. Therefore, this is an out ofinform statement. 
   
Question: garyn asks a direct question: why? This question is seeking an answer or explanation. Based on this, dialogueact of question has predicted as question 
          

A:
According to the dialogue acts defined by the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit, your answer is correct.

"
473,sure. just leave it to me. i'll finish it.,"

""just leave"" is a directive command. 
the ""i'll"" in the sentence is an expression of intent, and is therefore classified in question. 
  

A:
According to this article, ""Inform"" and ""Question"" are the two most common dialogue acts.  ""Directive"" appears to be the third most popular.

"
474,look at the show on tv. i am watching a food show at a very famous seafood restaurant. i really want to eat at that restaurant. i am a seafood lover.,"

overinform: the information request is too general and does not specify any particular restaurant
question: is it okay to watch a TV show while eating at this restaurant?
directive: you should watch the TV shows at another time. 
commissive : please watch TV at home before eating.

"
475,"speaking of seafood, my mouth is watering. let's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood.","

directive is the correct classification because it is an offer of assistance, and a request for a reply from another person. 
based on this example, it seems that the person asking for help is also offering help.

"
476,sound great. let's go!,"

In this example, ""yest"" and ""day"" are both adverbs, and they modify ""i had"" which is a past tense verb. Therefore, they can be used as adverbials to modify the past verb ""had"". In this case, it is clear that ""now"" is being used in the present perfect tense, so the meaning of the sentence is ""at this point in time, i am experiencing the following symptoms"": ""a runty nose"", ""with a stuffed-up nose"" etc. 
However, in this sentence, there is no request for advice, nor is there any mention of action. It is just a description of what the person is experiencing at the moment. This is an example of a commissives, as it conveys a request or a command.

"
477,look at the crystal clear fridge. you can see so many kinds of seafood in it. they all look very fresh and delicious.,"

overinform: the information provided is not enough to make a decision, more information is needed. 
question: is it necessary to develop the film here? perhaps the location is far away and it will take a long time to get the developed film back. 
	directive: it is necessary and urgent to have this film develop here. the seafood is very good and fresh, you should have it now.  
	commissive : it would be better to ask someone else to perform this action. it should be done by a professional.

"
478,true. i would like to have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head.,"

Overinform: This dialogueact is used when the information provided is too much. 
  For example, if a person tells you that they are going to win the lottery, this is overinformative. The information is not relevant to the current situation. 
Question: When a speaker asks aquestion, they want an answer. In this case, it is likely that a commissivedialogue act will be used. For example: ""What is the probability that you will winthe lottery?"". Here, winning the loterytells us nothing about the present situation, so the question is out of place. Therefore, a queryresponse is expected. However, in this example the person winningthe lotterymay not know the answer, and so a directiveresponse would be expected, such as ""I don't know, ask the machine"".
Directive: A directive response is when a  speaker is telling someone what todo.  In this context, telling you what you should do is a direct order, not a request. An example of adirective response wouldbe ""Clean the kitchen"". 
 Commissive : A commissIVE dialogue acts is one that isused when asking for something. A person asking you to clean thekitchen is askingyou to help them with a task.

"
479,you sound like a seafood expert. i would like to have some stir - fried squids and steamed shrimps.,"

'yes you have' is a confirmation of a statement. 
'these are the best squid i've ever had' can be considered a recommendation.

"
480,you are not too bad as well. i also want to have a steamed lobster. it is really taste like heaven.,"

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to express orders or requests. In this case, it's used as a way to request that the listener follow the advice of the first person in the conversation. 
  
  The first sentence of your reply is not a direct question. It's a directive. Directives are often used when someone is giving advice or instructions. This is because directives are more prescriptive than questions, asking the person being addressed to do something rather than asking for information.

"
481,let's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food.,"

In this example, we can see that the directive dialogue acts are used because of the use of ""go into"" and ""order some"". Without this context, it is not clear that this is a directive text. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue for Computer Scientists"" by John Grim, there are 4 types of dialogue: 
1. Commands: the sender wants the receiver to do something.  2. Inquiries: both want to find out something from the other. 3. Requests: one wants something of the other, and 4. Commissives: one is making some commitment to another.

 The text is asking for a phone number. It is an inquiry. The text can be rewritten as: ""Mr. Sandals, I would like you to give me your phone number.""

"
482,wait. let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first.,"

""wait"" is a word used in a question in this statement, so it is classified under question. However, ""tell"" would be classified out of question because it does not occur in that context. 
In this context, it would make more sense for the dialogue acts to be categorized as inform or directive. The speaker would not be asking the customer to do anything, but instead would just be providing the information that the chef is currently preparing the order. And the command ""in front"" of ""seafood fridge"" indicates that this is an order for which the person ordering is responsible for getting. So, this would classify as a directive order, as the chefs would need to make sure that order is placed infront of a seafood frige.

"
483,ok. i will wait for you inside the restaurant,"

 commissives are used to express a request for something to be done or to tell someone what to do. In this case, it is the speaker asking the listener to wait inside a restaurant. 
question asks for clarification or information. The listener is expected to provide an appropriate answer. 
  
out inform asks someone to stop doing something. in this example, i should wait outside the resturant.  out is used when someone is giving information or telling someone something without asking a specific question
directive tells someone or something what action to take. directive is often used in a negative context, to give someone advice or instructions to not do something
commissive is an order to someone else to carry out an action. It can also be used as a verb, meaning to order someone (or something) to perform an activity. Here, inside is a place or activity, and outside is someone who is being ordered to enter that place.

"
484,do you think we should try some deep fried oysters?,"

Directive is a directive act, which means it conveys a command or an order to another person. In this case, it is likely that the speaker is asking the listener to try deep-fried oyster. 
In addition, inform is the first choice for this dialogue. The text is providing the information that some people may consider it a good idea to have a taste of deepfried Oyster.

"
485,where do you want to go?,"

Question is the dialogueact of question mark (question mark is also a dialogue action). Question mark indicates that the sender wants to know something from the receiver. In this case, it is not clear from this sentence whether the person who asked wants information or advice. 
  

Inform: This text contains information that can help the recipient to understand the topic of conversation. For example, ""you sure know about Chinese Tea"" indicates the information is provided by the author and is based on their own knowledge. 
Out of Inform, Question, Directive, Commissive: It is possible that this is an example of commissives, where a speaker gives advice to another person. However, this does not make sense in this context, as the question is about the location of a tea shop, not about tea drinking etiquette.

"
486,i'm going to the hospital.,"

the text is providing useful information to someone who is going for a medical checkup. 
it is a good example of a text that can have any of these four dialogue acts.

"
487,get in. i'll take you.,"

In the example provided, there was a potential change to the timeframe, so the dialogue acts directive and commissIVE were more likely to be the correct classification.

"
488,about how much will it cost?,"

Question is a request for information. The question mark indicates that the speaker is looking for an answer to a question. In this case, howmuch will cost. 
Inform is the first dialogueact that comes to mind. This is because the information provided is about a person and a state, and the inability of the listener to dealwith distracting circumstances. 
  

Directive is another option that could be considered. It is used when a command or order is given.  In this instance, a suggestion is made. Based on this person’s current situation, they suggest that we spend more time together in a more relaxed setting. They are not asking you to do anything, nor are they giving you an order.

"
489,it will cost you $ 10.,"

inform: the first person in a conversation is likely to give information, rather than asking questions or giving orders. 
question: although inform is a good starting point, it's important to look at the context of the conversation to see if there are any questions being asked. If not, then question is more appropriate. 
 question: is there any context in which the person asking for the pictures could be asking a question? For example, they could ask ""why do you need the photos so urgently?"". In this context, inform would be more suitable.

"
490,"by the way, what's the time?","

Question: what time is it? 
Inform: it is 10:00 AM. 


"
491,"you can see the time on the meter. i have radio time, you know.","

In this example, we can clearly see that this is a question from the user, and the response is an instruction. 
  The text suggests that they are expressing an intention or need for the flowers to be bought for them.  This is clearly an express instruction, so the dialogue acts are classified here as directive and inform.

"
492,it's a quarter to 12. could you please drive a little faster?,"

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to ask someone or a group of people to carry out an action. In this example, it's likely that the person or people being asked to drive faster is or are the driver. 
  

Inform is another special kind of dialogical act that is used when someone is sharing general information, but is not asking someone else to take an specific action or do anything in particular. This is the case here. It's possible that this person is an observer, and the information is being shared to inform the listener or reader of something that's happening.

"
493,certainly.,"

This text does not provide any information on whether the evaluation was good or bad. The text simply states that the prediction was not particularly well received. 
  
  The predicted label is question (inform, out of question, directive, question). 
   
   The text is not asking a direct question. Rather, it is providing information that is being evaluated. Therefore, this is a commissative text.

"
494,you're made a good choice. this china tea set is unusual.,"

This text does provide information, but it does so by sharing facts about current and future energy supplies. The text is not asking a questions, giving commands, promising or committing.

"
495,where was it from?,"

Question is the only dialogueact that can be used to ask questions. The other four dialogue acts are used for providing information, making commands, giving orders, and making promises.

"
496,it was made in jingdezhen.,"

In this example, inform is the correct dialogue action label, because the information provided in the response is not a statement, a request, an order, nor a complaint, and so it does fit the definition of information.

"
497,jingdezhen? isn't it called'the capital of porcelain '?,"

This text indicates the need for information, and the person receiving the message is likely to have knowledge about it. Therefore, it is a  question.

"
498,you are right.,"

Actually, fruit and vegetable are good sources of vitamins and minerals. 
actually fruit are better sources than vegetables because vegetables are usually very processed and contain lots of sugar and salt.

"
499,this is the very thing i've been dreaming of.,"

Inform (inform, ask, understand, tell) is a natural language processing (NLP) dialogue action that indicates that a human is seeking information from another human. In this case, it appears that the speaker, who is asking a technical question about an issue, is actually seeking more information than is strictly necessary. This is because the technical nature of the question suggests that it may not be necessary for the asker to know the answer to their question in order to continue with the conversation. Therefore, inform is an appropriate classification for this dialogue. 
  
Question (question, inquire, seek, demand) indicates a conversation in which one person seeks information or clarification from the listener. It is important to note that this classification is based on how the dialogue is being interpreted by a computer, and does not necessarily reflect how a person would classify the same dialogue in real life. For example, a commissIVE (order, order, command, obedience) classification would be considered a query in a real conversation, as it would indicate that one is commanding the information to the addressee. However, in this example the classification of question is more accurate, since the inquire and command would occur simultaneously.

"
500,it is the best quality porcelain - the famous egg - shell china.,"

This text indicates that it is giving information about the quality of the product. The inform dialogue acts include informing, advising, recommending, suggesting, making a suggestion, expressing an opinion, giving an account, explaining, or justifying. 
  
  The text mentions that this is a famous chinese porcellain, which is an egg-shaped porridgeware used for serving food. This type of porceryware is usually made of fine chunck porite, glazed with a thin layer of glaze. It is very durable and can be used to serve hot or cold food, so it's very popular.

"
501,it must be most precious.,"

inform: this is most likely a confirmation of an appointment, so it's most probably a directive dialogueact. 
question: it could be a direct question or a statement of fact. It could also be that this person just doesn't know the answer to this question and is looking for someone to ask. We can't tell from the context. 
"
502,but it is really worth the price.,"

Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the most appropriate. This is because the information provided in the passage is about a personal characteristic, and the writer is sharing his or her feelings about it.

"
503,"hello, miao li, where are you going?","

Question dialogue acts are used to seek information from the other person. In this case, it seems like the sender is seeking information about where the recipient is going, so the question dialogueact is used. 
Hello, Miao Li, I am going to [place name]. I will tell you where I’m going if you like. 
  
Out of question: the request for directions is out of the scope of what the person is asking for. The person asking is not asking about directions, they’re asking where Miaoli is heading. So this is a question. However, since the direction is about the location of Mio Li and not about Mie’s own destination, this dialogue is classified here as a request.  

"
504,"hello, i am going to the store to buy some fruit.","

Out of question: the taxi driver is not asking a direct question. 
Question: is the driver asking the time or asking for directions? 

 

Directive: I am buying fruit, please take me to that store. 


 
  

 commissIVE: Please take the fruit to my car and then take you to this store
I will be back with the fruits.

  

"
505,"oh, would you do me a favor?","

Directives are used when the person asking the question is also the one performing the action. In this case, since the asker is the author of the message, it is reasonable to assume that she is performing a favour for the listener. 
  
Question: is this a request for a small favour? 
          
Inform: yes, I'd be happy to help you out. Please let me know what you need.

"
506,yes?,"

Question is used to seek information and clarification, and this is a request for feedback. 
Overinform is the opposite of question and indicates the information is provided. In this case, it's not. The question is ""how did I do?"". Overinform would be ""you passed the driving exam with flying colors"".

question
So how'd Ido onmy drivingtest? 

 
Yes, that is correct.

"
507,please mail this letter for me on your way to the store.,"

Directive is a special type of question that is used to request a service or action. In this case, it's requesting that the letter be mailed on someone's way out the door.

"
508,sure. do you want it to be registered?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to ask questions. The question here is whether the sender wants the information to get registered. Based on their response 'yes', the question is answered and the dialogue ends. 
  
Overinform dialogue Acts are similar to questions, but they are more general and are often used when the other options are not applicable. For example, if I ask you how your day was, you might respond with a detailed account of your activities. This is an overinform act, because there are many other ways to respond to this question. However, it would be more appropriate to use a commissIVE dialogue action, such as 'tell me about your days', which would provide a more succinct account. 

Direct dialogue Act is used by the speaker to communicate a request or order to the listener. In this case, 'do you have any questions for me?'. If the receiver does have a follow up question after the initial request, then the order is followed and a direct dialogue is concluded. Otherwise, a non-directive dialogue would conclude the conversation.  In this example the request is for the questions to follow, so a command is the most appropriate dialogue label.

"
509,"yes, i think so. there are some pictures in it. it would be a great pity if they were lost.","

the given statement, “I learned that,” does NOT ask for a confirmation or a commitment;
it does, however, indicate that a new piece of information has just been shared by the person speaking. In this case, it seems that they learned something new, and the statement is an example of the inform discourse act;

"
510,"yes, i will be glad to mail your letter.","

In the provided text the person who is supposed to do the picking is not mentioned. However, it is clear that someone needs do this task, and the sender is asking if anyone will do it. The classification of the response as Commissive indicates that the responder is volunteering to take on this responsibility.

"
511,thanks.,"

In the first sentence, ""I'll"" is used to indicate the subject of the sentence is a person. This is an indicative sentence of a directive act, as the person is telling the listener what to do. 
""Use"" indicates that what follows is something that can be used, which is in contrast to something the thelistener should not use. The ingredients mentioned in the second sentence are things that could be consumed, so the ingredients are not to be eaten. 
  
However, in this sentence ""Use ginger garlic scallion hot peppers vinegar"" the verbs ""use"" and ""have"" are used in a transitive manner, indicating that something can act upon or be acted upon. In this case, it is likely that ""using"" refers to the process of preparing the dish, rather than the finished dish. Therefore, this is classified under question.

"
512,you are welcome.,"

Overinform: This dialogueact is used when the sender is seeking more information than is actually necessary. For example, if the message is sent to ask about the weather, but the person being asked about is interested in the upcoming football championship, overinform would be used to describe the second message. 
Question: If the dialogue acts of the two messages are question and inform respectively, then the use of question is considered to be the strongest evidence that the communication is a request for information. 
  Question is also used in situations where the information is not relevant, or is of poor quality. In this case, inform is usually used.  
Directive: Directive is the most common dialogue action used by senders who are trying to get the receiver to take some action. This action could be to inform the receivers of something, to request something from the recipient,  to tell the recipients of a specific event. The use  of directive is often considered the weakest form of dialogue. It is only used if no other form is suitable.   
 commissitive: Commissive  is used only when asking for something. If a message asks for a response or a certain action, it is commissative.

"
513,"i have a cell phone in my car. now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side. why don't you get it for me, and then i can call the police?","

Directive is a special type of question that is used to request a
  response from the addressee. The addressees are typically not aware that
they are being asked to do something, so they are more likely to comply
with the request. 
  
In this example, it is not clear whether the person who asked for the cellphone is aware of the fact that it would be rude to not offer the phone to the asker. Therefore, this is considered a directive question and the directive dialogue acts are likely being used.

"
514,alright.,"

This text is asking for information, so the dialogue acts are question and commissIVE. 
However, this is not a request for assistance, as the greeting ""alight"" is followed immediately by the inquiry ""Can I Help You?"".

"
515,it doesn't work. it looks like it's broken. i need to get to a hospital. you should drive me there.,"

In this example, ""you should"" is a command, and the context of the conversation (i.e. the surrounding words and phrases) indicate that it is being given as an order. 
  ""You should... drive... me... there"" indicates the order is to drive the person to the hospital, rather than a request for assistance.

"
516,"oh, yeah? it's better if we make a police report first. then you can go to the hospital.","

In this example, it is clear that the person asking for a copy of the Invoice is directing the other person to do something, namely to make an official police statement. Without this information, we cannot know whether the request is made out of concern or curiosity.

"
517,damn it! i'm injured here. we could wait all day for the police.,"

""Surely"" is a phrase that can indicate seeking clarification or confirmation. Based on this, it is possible that the speaker is seeking information from the hearer. 
  
If the policeman is not available, then the question is probably a request for advice or assistance. In this case, ""of course"", when used as an interjection, can also be used to confirm or clarify something that has just been said.

"
518,"well, you'll just have to wait. i'm not going to move my car until the police arrive. i'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone. don't worry. you'll get to the hospital in time.","

Well, I'm sorry, but I don’t have any maps for downtown. I’ll have the Google Maps app send you a map of your location.

"
519,it really hurts.,"

Because the dialogue acts of the sentence are overinform, overquestion,
overdirect, and overcommissive. 
  
Overinform: This is a negative statement that provides information but does not ask a follow-up question. 
This is not a directive or commissIVE statement. It is just a plain statement of fact. The speaker does NOT want to or cannot go any faster. This statement is therefore over-inform.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_act)

In this example, it really hurt to see a car crash. I was watching it on TV and it hurts to think that someone could drive that way and not see what they were doing.

"
520,"yes, maybe it does. but if you're going to drive like you did just now, you will have to get used to a little physical pain. you know what i mean?","

Question dialogue acts are used when the information provided is incomplete or when a direct request for information is not appropriate. For example, a person might ask ""are we there yet?"" when they are only halfway through a journey. 
  
Out of question question: I don't know. Ask her.

"
521,to hell with you. the accident was your fault.,"

""to heck with"" is a curse word. It is not used in a question or statement of fact. The statement is meant to insult the person who was in an accident. Therefore, this is considered an inform dialogueact. 
  

A:
According to the dialogue acts dataset, your answer is correct.

"
522,"i'm afraid it wasn't. and when the police get here, you will also see that it wasn't. but enough of this bickering. i'm going to go find a phone. don't move that arm while i'm gone. alright?","

""i’m afraid that wasn’t"" is an example of the over act, which indicates the information provided is too much. The speaker was afraid the person they were speaking to wouldn't be interested in what they had to say, but didn't provide enough information to convince the listener. 
  
  ""but enough"" could be considered a question or a directive act which would indicate the speakers are conveying that they are finished speaking and would like the other person to respond. However, since the act doesn't include a response from the second person, it is classified here as over inform.

"
523,to hell with you.,"

Overinform: This text contains the word ""you"" which is used to request information from the listener. This is a strong indicator that the speaker is trying to overinform thelistener. 
  
Question:  The phrase 'howareyou' is followed by 'good tohearfromyou'. This phrase is commonly used in casual conversation to seek information. The phrase also contains a 'you', which can be used as a pronoun to emphasize the question and increase the likelihood of a response.  This is also a common phrase used by sales people to find out if the customer is interested in a product. In this case, it is likely the author is seeking confirmation that Mike is OK.

"
524,"good morning. vane theater, at your service.","

Inform (question, direct, command, commisive) are used when the information is being provided to the listener. 
Overinform (overshadow, overhear, uncover, overture) is used to describe information that is not relevant to what is happening in the conversation. 
  
Question (ask), directive (order), command (obey), commissIVE (promise)  are used for asking, ordering, obeying, promising information to another person.

"
525,hello. i'm thinking about watching a chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl. what's on this weekend?,"

Question: ""What's On This Weekend?"" is a statement, not a request for information. The speaker wants to know what is on TV this upcoming weekend. 
Inform: This text contains pieces information that the speakers are sharing with their listener. For example, ""I'm Thinking About Watching A Chinese Traditional Opera With A Foreign Girl"" is information, and ""Chinese Opera"" and  ""A Foreign girl"" are facts that are being disclosed. 
  

Out of question: the statement is not asking for confirmation or information; it is simply acknowledging the situation. This is an inform act.

"
526,"well, there will be charity performance on saturday night. and also, there will be a solo concert by an opera star on sunday night.","

the given textual content, ""i dont know wht to told you"", is conveying information, not a request for information or a directive. Therefore it is classified under 'inform'
without revealing this dialogue-act prediction, I can say that the given content is expressing uncertainty.

"
527,it's a good thing that i have choices here. can you tell me about the one on saturday?,"

Directive is the most general dialogue acts. It indicates that the
  speaker is giving orders to thelistener. In this case, it is likely that
the speaker wants the caller to make a recommendation for a specific
restaurant on Saturday. 
Inform is used when thespeakerto someone who already knows something about something. This is often the case when someone is telling a story or giving information. 
  In this example, inform is probably used because the person who is speaking to you is not new to Chinese Tea, but is instead acknowledging that you know quite a bit about this topic.  
Question is another general type of dialogue. When a question is asked, there is usually a desire to find the answer in a conversation. Here, we can see that someone wants to know more about Chinese teas. They are probably asking you because they are curious and want to learn more. Question is also used in this context because you are asking them a questions.   
Request is when a person is asking someone else to do something, usually for benefit. For example: ""Would you please pass the salt?"". Request is most likely used here because it seems like the callers are requesting that a restaurant recommendation be made.

"
528,sure. it's to raise money for the homeless.,"

based on this passage, it seems that the inform act was classified incorrectly. The inform action is mentioned in the passage as ""raising money"". So it would make sense that raising money would be aninform action. However, in this case, ""it's"" is an exclamation point, and it sounds like the author is expressing surprise or excitement at something. So theinform act seems to have been applied to this action, even though it doesnot fit the definition of the term.

"
529,what about the performance itself?,"

question is the most likely dialogueact given the context of the passage. The speaker has just realized they need to finish a project, so they are likely asking a question: ""what exactly do i need?"". 
overinform, inform are both likely given that they don't know what they're talking about, they just want to share their knowledge. 
  question, overquestion are also possible, but less likely since the question is being raised in response to the inform.

"
530,"oh, it's a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven.","

overinform: This dialogueact is used when the speaker is providing too much information. 
question: this dialogue acts is often used in questions to indicate that the information being provided is being requested. 
  questioning: ""What is the name of the opera?""
directive: directive dialogueacts are used for requests that are not fully under the control of another person or entity. In this case, Heaven is not a person, entity, or other character in the story. It is simply a setting. Heaven could therefore not issue commands or make requests. Commands are therefore implied. ""Please tell me the title of opera.""
commissive dialogue Acts are often associated with requests for punishment. This act can be used if the person making the request is asking for something bad to happen to someone else. For example, ""please kill the mouse"" or ""stop whining"". In the former case the command is to issue to the listener, in this latter case it would be issued to a character. Since the character is requesting something to occur to them, this is considered a commissIVE dialogue action.

"
531,"wow, a story about the clever monkey king. it's a classic and children's favorite.","

overinform: the sender is not asking a direct question but rather is providing background information to the receiver
question: this is a typical question that is used to initiate a conversation
directive: if the answer is no, then the conversation should stop here
 commissIVE: but if yes, this conversation could continue with the next line of text

I hope this helps!

"
532,it surely is. and the cast is really the best.,"

overinform: this is the most common dialogueact in this context. It is used to provide background information or clarify something that has not been said. 
  
question: the main character is asking ""werent you"" which suggests that he is curious and wants to know something. 

A:
According to the book ""Text to Speech for Dummies"" by John Swets, there are 4 possible dialogue acts for a text to speech engine: 

 
Out of the 4, Out of context is probably the least likely to occur.  Out-of-context is when the engine reads a section of text out of order. For example, if the first sentence of an email is ""Hi,"" the second sentence is likely Out-Of-Context. This is because the email was sent, and you are reading it now, so the sentence that follows the ""hi"" is most likely the next sentence. However, this can also occur if you have the audio file in reverse order, with the last sentence being the one that is Out Of Context.

"
533,wonderful! how much is the ticket?,"

Question is a sub-class of directive. Question is used to ask for further information. In this example, it is unclear from the given statement whether the person asking the question is also interested in buying the fruit or vegetable. The person might be asking to clarify whether they are interested to buy the item or not. 
  
Out of question and question are the only two possible dialogue acts for inform: inform is only one possible label, but it could also be considered a question.

"
534,"the price varies according to the seats. 300 for the front, 200 for the middle, and 50 for the back.","

Overinform: the price is 300 per person for front row, middle row and back row. This is too much for a chicken. 
  Question: what is the actual price of chicken? 
   Directive: pay attention to your surroundings. There might be a cheaper price somewhere.  
  Commissive : I will find a better price.

"
535,all right. i want to bring everybody back on this subject. when can we start working on this?,"

the speaker has not asked a direct question;
there is no directive word in the dialogue, and the only commissives are the preposition of place, which is used to introduce a place or location, not to direct something; and
information is given about a personal feeling, rather than a fact. 
  

In summary, this is a statement of personal feelings, with no question or directive.

All right, let’s move on to the next text. 
Text 2:
Hi, I’m Bob. I am a data scientist at Databricks. My team and I are working to build a new product that will help data scientists and machine learning engineers better manage their time and improve the productivity of their work. We are currently building the product and need to find a good name for it. Our product will be called TimeBlock.  We are looking for a name that:  - is memorable and easy to say;       - is short and concise;     - has a positive connotation;          and         - does not contain any offensive words.    
We have come up with a few names that we think are good, including: Time Block, TimeWise, Block Time,                                 Block Timewisely, TimeBlockly,  Time Blockly. Which of these names would you recommend?

 
Bob: I think the names Timeblock, timewise, block time,block timewisly and timeblockly are all good. 

 

I think these are very appropriate names for our product. They are short, concise, positive, easy for data scientists and machine learning engineers to remember, are not offensive,and contain no special characters. In addition, they are similar to other names we have considered, such as time block,timewise and block time, all of which have positive associations. Therefore, we will use these as the name of our new product. Thank you for your help. 

  
  





"
536,"well, we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2 : 00.","

Directive is a type of dialogue acts that are used to express instructions, orders, and suggestions. 
  
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_act

In this case, it is likely that the person who is supposed to take the phone at that airport is not available, but the message is providing the information that someone should be taking the call.

"
537,"i tell you what, 2 : 00 is not available for me, but you can get started and i'll come by at around 3 : 00","

Directive is a directive dialogueact, where the speaker wants the listener to do something. In this case, ""i'll be there at 3:00"" is the action the person wants you to take. 
Question is another directive act, this time the question is ""why are you telling me this?"". The speaker is asking you a direct question. 
  
Inform is an informative act where a speaker tells another person something that they already know.  In this example, it's an informational statement about when 2: 00 pm is available to drive.

"
538,that's fine with me. how much time are we going to have to work on this?,"

Question is used in this context to indicate that the speaker is seeking information from the listener. The speaker wants to know how long they will have in order to complete the task at hand. 
  
In contrast, inform is a non-question form of communication that is generally used to share information. In this case, information is being shared about how the other person is currently feeling and how they are unable to deal well with distracting situations. This is also being done in a friendly manner.

"
539,"perhaps one year, i'm not sure.","

inform: this is a request for information. 
question: how do i stick with only these foods?
directive: stickwiththesefoods.com
commissive : i will stick only with thesefoods

"
540,what dressing would you like on the salad?,"

This text contains an initial greeting ""good morning"" and then a question ""Can I Help You?"". This is a typical pattern of a dialogue question. 
  
In addition, this is the only text in the data set that starts a new paragraph with the word ""Please"". This indicates that the writer is seeking a reply from another person.

"
541,"french dressing, please.","

the text is asking for a direction, not giving information, making promises or giving evaluations

A:
According to the GPT-3 model, this is the correct response: 
""The text'how bad  did i  do'is  seeking  information or  an evaluation  from the  recipient,  which is characteristic  of a  question. ""

"
542,i beg your pardon?,"

Question is used to ask for clarification or information, and it is a natural response to a prompt. The person asking the question is probably seeking clarification about something the other person said. 
  
Out ofinform: This indicates the speaker is not providing information and is instead giving advice or a recommendation. For example, a salesperson might say, ""We recommend you buy this product."" 
   
Overinform indicates a speaker providing too much information or too little information; the information is either not useful or may be misleading. A common example of overinformatin is when a person says, “I’m so glad you asked me that question. I’ve been meaning to tell you…” This is an example that overinforms when it should be questioned.

"
543,"oh, french dressing.","

Inform is used when the information is being provided to another person, and the person receiving the communication is not a direct participant in the conversation. This is the most common use of the inform act. 
  
Question is when someone is asking someone else a specific question. In this case, it is likely that the question is about the type of dressing that is appropriate for a particular meal. The person asking the questions is typically the one asking for information, whereas the other person is receiving information.

"
544,"sorry, it's not available now. anything else?","

Question dialogue acts are often used when someone is seeking information or clarification. In this case, ""would you like..."" is asking for a response. The response ""yes"" indicates the question was answered, and the two-step dialogue is over. 
  
In contrast, inform (information) dialogue Acts are used to provide information. ""Would you rather go..."" does not ask for information, so it is not classified under question dialogue. It is classified instead as information under informatory dialogue, because it provides information about a choice. This is a common use of question acts.

"
545,we still prefer french dressing.,"

Inform is a request for information. The author is asking the reader for feedback on a particular aspect of a text. 
Question is an interrogative statement that asks a factual question. In this case, ""is it a direct instruction?"". 
 Directive is used to express a command or an order. This text could be interpreted as a ""don't repeat this again"" type of instruction. Commands and orders are typically given by people who are in a position of authority, such as parents or teachers. Commissive, on its own, is often used as an exclamation to emphasize a point or express strong emotion. However, in this example, it seems to be used in combination with the directive label to indicate that the author feels that they should be given credit for being a good parent or teacher.

"
546,could i have some fish?,"

This text is informational in that it provides the reader with information that is not asked for or promised. The reader is aware of the fact that the item is available in limited quantity, but is otherwise not told how many copies are available. 
  
  This is a directive dialogue, because the writer is asking the receiver to do something. They are asking for fish, which is an action.

"
547,certainly. and what vegetables would you like?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to clarify information or request further information. The question 'what vegetables' in this example is asking the person answering the question to specify which vegetables are desired. 
  

Inform dialogue Acts are not used for clarifying information, but for providing information without request or promise of reward. 'It's Free of Charge' is an example of informational dialogue acting.

"
548,"oh, spinach, i think.","

 spinach is an item that is often considered to be unhealthy. The speaker in this example is likely expressing a preference for not eating spinach. 
  
  Based off of the provided text and the dialogue acts associated, it is most likely that the inform act was predicted.

"
549,"fine, and what about something to drink?","

""Something to Drink"" is a question from the reader. It indicates the author is asking the narrator for information and the dialogue acts are question and answer. 
  
  The question is ""Something To Drinking?"". This is an open question that invites the answer ""Water"". The question marks indicate that there is uncertainty in the question. ""To Drin"" could be a command or a request.

"
550,"just a beer, please.","

inform: This is a request for information. 
question: Is there anything else?
directive: Have a drink, and feel free to ask any questions you might have. 
	(This is the answer.)
 commissIVE: Yes, there is one more type of tea: scenting tea.

"
551,good. thank you. sir.,"

Statements that are merely acknowledging or expressing regret for a past action are not typically considered to be asking or giving orders. However, if the statement is part of a larger conversation in which the other person is also expressing their apology, then the act may be considered commissIVE.

"
552,would you like to have some more beer?,"

Directive is a special type of question that is used to request a
action or response from the listener. In this case, it's likely the
speaker is inquisitively seeking the customer's opinion on whether
they would like another beer.

"
553,"no, thanks. i've had enough. i'll have my bill, please.","

Because the first part of the response - 'i've have had enought' - is not a confirmational statement but a request for a clarification. Therefore, it does neither confirm nor deny the information provided before. 
  
And the second part - ""i'll hava mybill, plz."" - does confirm the previous information, but also asks for something in return. This is a commissitive statement, and directive is the correct dialogueact for it.

"
554,of course. please wait a moment. i'll go and get it.,"

 commissives are used to request information or assistance from another person. The recipient of the message is being asked to wait, so that another employee can get the requested item for them. 
  

Note that this is just a classification, and not a prediction.

"
555,thank you.,"

inform: this is a request for information, not a command or a suggestion
question: the speaker is looking for an explanation or confirmation
directive: something should be done, don't do this
commissive (sometimes called negative command): the opposite of a directive: don’t do it

In summary, inform is the most likely dialogueact of the four choices, and question is one of them.

"
556,"hi, george. i'm going to have a job interview next week. could you give me some advice?","

George is giving advice to the person who is going for a
job interview. George is neither asking questions of the interviewee,
making commitments for them, nor providing additional information. He
is simply providing advice. 
  
This text is a good example of a directive dialogue.

"
557,"sure. first of all, it ’ s very important for you not to be late. job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time, only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic.","

Directive dialogue acts are used when the speaker is trying to achieve a goal or when they are giving instructions. In this case, they want the listener to do something. 
In this sentence, ""recommendation"" is the goal of which the user is asking. So, this is most likely a directive dialogue.

"
558,"yeah, that's very important.","

inform: this is not a directive text. The speaker in this example is providing the information that their reservation has gone through. This is an inform text
question: I'm not sure, but I think this could be a query in the question format. I would need to see more context to be sure. 
directive: the person is asking for a phone # and not giving any context for why they need it. 
 commissives: there is no indication of any kind of commitment or request in here.

"
559,"so you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time, look around to see what the employees are wearing. so the next day you will arrive early for the appointment.","

the given textual evidence does indeed suggest that the person asking the question is indeed interested in the answer to the original question: yes,  you did. 
but the textual indication that this person is actually interested is a directive statement: look what employees wear. The textual clue that directs the reader to look at something else is question word: what Employees wear? 

 

A:

This is an example of a commisive act.  A commiserative act, on a larger scale, is when a group of people come together to commise with a person who has passed away.

"
560,i ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer.,"

In the first paragraph, it is mentioned that ""it was a fun night out at a movie."" The use of the word ""out"" in the second sentence indicates the event was not necessarily a success. This is consistent with the inform dialogue acts, as they are used when the information being conveyed is incomplete or when a question is asked. 
  
When the paragraph mentions ""friday,"" it indicates this is the specific date for the next outting. The sender of text wants to set a specific time and date to meet again, indicating a commissIVE dialogue.

"
561,"that ’ s right. you need to create a good image in a limited time, usually about 30 to 45 minutes.","

Overinform: This is a way to say that the information provided is not enough to form an opinion. 
Question: this is used when someone asks a direct question. The question is the main part of the dialogue and inform is just one of many possible dialogue acts. 
  Directive:  This is when the person giving the instruction is also asking for a response.  
Commissive : This means that someone is asking someone else to do something.

"
562,it ’ s always easier to say something than to do it.,"

Inform is the easiest to understand dialogue acts. It is used to provide information to the other person. In this case, it is likely that this person has asked a general question and you are providing the information that you were thinking of providing. 
Question is a more difficult dialogueact to use. When used appropriately, a person will often use this dialogueAct to ask a specific question or to request clarification of something that was not clear. 
  In this example, when the inform dialogue Act is followed by a directive or commissIVE dialogue Acts, this indicates a shift in the conversation from information-gathering to a request for a response. The person may be looking for an explanation or clarification, or they may want you to take some action.

"
563,"it ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression. for example, you should take care to appear well - groomed and modestly dressed. avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style. this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications.","

It is sharing information, so it is a dialogue partner. Therefore, it would be a direct request to share more information. The interviewers would expect you to provide more details. 
"
564,but i love wearing t - shirts and jeans.,"

'I love to wear t-shirts and  jeans.' is an example of a statement, not a request for information. The statement does provide a confirmation of the speaker's current preference, but does so in the form of an affirmation, rather than a query. 
Statement: I love  to wear  t- shirts  and jeans
Predicted Dialogue Act: affirm (statement)

Inform (question, direct, request, commisive)

"
565,"i advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview. informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job, or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes.","

In this example, it is clear that this is an instance of giving instructions or requests. The text clearly expresses the desire of the interviewee to alter the value of one detail from a previous value to a new value. This is expressed through the use of present tense and the reference to ""the value"" (date). The use the present perfect tense suggests a long-term desire to make the alteration, and also implies that there was a point in the past when the request was made. Additionally, there is the mention of ""a detail"" which suggests the intention is to specify a particular aspect of something. Finally, in this instance, ""altering"" is used to describe the action of changing the previous date value for the new date. All of these factors suggest that it would be a question to request an alteration of some kind. 
  

A:
According to this website, here are the possible dialogue acts for this sample text: 
overinform: This text does not contain any information about what the candidate wants. It could be an advertisement, a recruitment brochure, an announcement, etc.  Question: What do you want?      Directive: I want you to give me a call on 07771 017 018.       Commissive : That's not a number. I don't know what you mean. Question: Do you know someone called 0777 117 118?     Directive : No, I do not. But I will find out.

"
566,it ’ s a pity that i cannot afford more expensive clothes.,"

It is a shame that I cannot buy more costly clothes, since I would like to look nice. This text can also be seen as an acknowledgment of what was said, because the speaker acknowledges that they cannot purchase more fashionable clothes at the moment.

"
567,"you misunderstood me. clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job, or that you are snobbish or frivolous.","

I think the inform dialogue acts are overinform,question,directive,commissive. The text is providing the information that the clothes are not appropriate or are suggesting that they are expensive. It is not asking, directing, commending or promising anything.

"
568,i know what you mean. i ought to wear right clothes at the right time.,"

Overinform: This dialogueact is used when the information provided is too much. It is often used in news articles to provide a summary of a longer story. 
Question: When the provided information is not enough to answer the question. For example, ""why?"" or ""how?"" are questions that question dialogue acts are often associated. 
  Directive:  When the person giving the instruction is also asking for the action to be taken.  For example ""turn off the lights"" is directive if the addressee is expected to take the requested action. Commissive is when a person is asking another person to do something but the asker is expecting a response. In this case the response is usually a confirmation or an agreement. ""yes, of course"" or similar.

"
569,you got it. only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement.,"

Inform acts are used to request or give information. The inform act can be used in both question and statement forms. 
  
Question forms: I would like to know something more about my family
Statement forms : I learned something new about our family today

A:
According to this article, there are 4 types of dialogue acts: 
1. Request: the person is requesting information from the other person
2. Commend: person A commends person B for something they did
3. Inform: A person informs B about something B did or said
4. Question: B asks A a question
5. Directive: Person A gives a direct order to B
6. Commissive : Person B tells A they are going to do something and A asks them not to

"
570,it seems that'clothes make the man '.,"

In this example,'reserving a room' is an intention or desire, so the dialogue acts are directive. 
However, it is also possible that 'room reservation' was a simple request for information. In this scenario, inform would be the correct classification.

"
571,"it may not be true, but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior.","

Out ofinform: This is not a statement of fact, it's an expression of opinion. 
Question: Does this statement ask questions about the meaning of the words or the statement itself? 

 

Directive: Is this a request for an action to be taken?
Commissive (or Inform): This statement is an attempt to influence someone's behavior or opinion, for example, ""You should do this.""

"
572,"the boss announces the pay raise today, right? how much do you think we'll get?","

Question is used to ask for information or clarification. The question here is how the employee thinks the company will do after the announcement. 
  
Overinform is when the information provided is too much or too little. In this case, it's too low, since the salary increase is not that significant. 

question, overinform, direct, ask, how, salary, increase, significant
Inform is the default dialogueact in this situation. This is because the person giving the statement is just providing the facts, and is neither asking for clarification nor giving an order.

"
573,no idea. your guess is as good as mine.,"

inform: this is not a request for information, but rather for
  clarification. 
question: is this a general question or a more specific one?
directive: please tell me what to DO!
 commissIVE: I think you should do this!

"
574,it better be more than last year.,"

Inform is used when the message is more about sharing information than asking a question or giving advice. Inform acts can also be used in a request or command form, such as when a subordinate asks for direction or when an authority figure gives orders. 
  
Question is a directive dialogueact used to ask a direct question. It is not used for sharing general information. 
Directive is another directive act used only for asking or telling someone what to do. This act does not include any information or advice about what the person should do or how to accomplish something.

"
575,"well, anything is better than nothing. wait and see.","

inform is a sub-class of question. Inform questions are used to request or ask for information. 
  
question is another sub class of dialogue acts. Question dialogue Acts are the ones that are answered with a question (yes/no/maybe). 
   
directive is one of the four main dialogue classes. It is used when the person is asking for a response from another person. They are usually asking someone to do something.  

"
576,"i'm sorry, our appointment has to be changed.","

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that express a command, order, or suggestion. 
  
  In this example, based on this sentence, it is clear that a directive dialogue is being expressed. The speaker has offered an appointment change, but the other party has not accepted the offer. This is an order or a suggestion, not a question or an offer of information.

"
577,what a pity!,"

Inform ( over question, command, commitment) because it provides the information of a geographical distance and travel times. 
Over inform: the provided information is not only useful but also interesting. The provided distance is the actual distance, and the estimated travel-time is also accurate. 
  Question: is this distance accurate? 
 Command: turn right at the fork in the road.  
 Commitment: I will turn the car right after the traffic light turns green.

"
578,"if you don't mind, may we put it off to the next day?","

Out of the four options, only directive is a likely response. The other options are requests for information, questions, and orders. Directives are often used to give instructions or orders, so it makes sense that this would be a possible response to this question.

"
579,that's ok.,"

Inform (or Inform) is a dialogueact in which the sender conveys information to a recipient. The sender typically uses words like tell, tell me, let me tell you, show me and so on to communicate that they are conveying information. 
  
Out of Informat, Question, Directive, Commisive is the corresponding dialogue acts. 
Question is used to ask questions.  Directive  is used when a person is giving orders. Commision is when someone is making promises or commitments.

"
580,"good day! welcome to lincoln bank, how may we assist you?","

Question is used to indicate that a statement is being made to find out information, whereas directive and commissives are used for telling someone what to do. In this case, it appears that Lincoln Bank is asking the question of whether the person they are speaking to is interested in buying some marijuana. 
  

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible responses to a question: 
1. Yes
2. No
3. I don't know
4. Can't answer
In your example, ""hey, man wanna Buy some Weed?"" the response is ""Yes"" because the listener is expected to take the action that is suggested.

"
581,hello. i need to find out if a receipt of proceeds has arrived. i'm from felix wasserman associates.,"

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to convey instructions, orders, requests, suggestions, etc. without asking any questions. 
  
  In this example, red is the subject of the sentence, so the directive is about how to use the word red. The sentence is telling you to look up the definition of red in a dictionary.

"
582,thanks. have you got the l / c number?,"

Question is characteristic as it is used in seeking more
information. 
  In this case, it seems the questioner is looking for an
explanation about the previous mention of the L / C number.

"
583,it's nx567822100007.,"

This text provided specific details about a cost, and therefore it likely is an act classified under the inform category. 
  
  The text does ask questions, make commitments, directives, etc. and so it does fall into one of the other categories. However, because it provided details of specific cost information, it falls into the act category of provide specific.

"
584,hang on a tick and i'll check for you. i'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving.,"

inform: indicates the information is new or surprising and requires clarification. 
question: questions the accuracy of information provided. 
  questioning the informer: implies the source of knowledge is not trustworthy.  
directive: suggests a course of action. Commands are usually given in the form of a command. The addressee is expected to carry them out.   
commissive (sometimes called reactive): implies a request for a response or a follow up action, and implies some action has already been taken.

"
585,"ok, thanks for checking. could you give me a ring when it arrives, please?","

Directive dialogue acts are used to suggest an activity, course of action, or other course or course-of-action to the listener. Informative dialogue Acts are typically used when asking questions. 
  
In this case, it seems like the author is suggesting an alternative action to take in the situation described, and is therefore using a directive dialogueact.

"
586,no problem. i'll be in touch as soon as it comes in.,"

 commissives are used to express strong opinions or commands. In this case, it seems like the employee is telling thecustomer to leave the store and not to contact them again.

"
587,may i help you?,"

Question is used to clarify information or request clarification. The question in this example is asking the person assisting to help the user. 
  
Overinform is similar to inform but it also conveys a sense that more information is available but not requested. Inform is the default dialogue action and is not to be confused with overinform. 
question is also used in indirect speech to introduce a new topic or subject. This is because question is a modal verb, it can be used both as a verb and as an adjective to describe an action. For example,'may I help?' is an indirect question asking a permission. 'May I ask you a personal question?' can also be interpreted as indirect indirect questioning.

"
588,"yes. i have to stay in your cry for just one day, can you suggest a short tour?","

Directive is the most likely classification because the sender is suggesting the recipient follow a specific course or action in future. 
In addition, this is an example of how a text can be classified using a machine learning model. The model was trained on a large corpus of text and was able to correctly classify the dialogue acts in this example.

"
589,are you interested in the natural landscape or the human landscape?,"

Question: Are you currently using any of the fossil fuel sources? 
Answer: No, we don’t use fossil-fuels. Most of Our power is generated by hydro-electrical plants, and we are hoping in in future to incorporate more from wind-power.

"
590,i would prefer the first one.,"

In the second example, ""how it started"" is a question. However, based on ""allright,young man."", the person is clearly giving a command or instruction. Therefore, this is classified under directive.

"
591,sure. we have a one - day trip along the river. it's quite beautiful.,"

In this example, it is not clear that the person is asking the advice of the narrator. In fact, they seem to be sharing the information without any request for help.

"
592,"hello, sir. how can we help you today?","

This text conveives information to the listener. The speaker is expressing that they do not know how to help the caller.

"
593,"i need to find out some more information for l / c. i would like an outline of responsibilities, both ours, yours and the beneficiary, please.","

Directive is the most likely dialogueact for this section of the message. The sender is asking the receiver for information and clarification. This is typical for a directive act. 
  
Outline of Responsibilities:
- ours: what is being asked for
  - is this something we are responsible for?
    - yes
      - then we need the authority to oblige

the beneficiary: yes, we can help
 - then please tell us more
   - ok
     - what exactly do you need?

 - ours and beneficiary : we will get back to you

  The receiver of such a message is typically looking for more details and is expecting a response.

"
594,"ok, to start, the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include insurance forms, way bills, bills of lading, customs forms, various certificates.","

In this example, 'how are' is an indication of the questioner seeking
information from their interlocutor.

"
595,"ok, got it. is there anything else i need to know before we go ahead?","

Question indicates the speaker is looking for an opinion or answer. 
Inform indicates a response is expected. 
  Question is a request for information.

"
596,"just that in effect, a basic letter of credit is a financial contract between the bank, the bank's customer, and the beneficiary, and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds.","

outofinformquestiondirectivecommissive

A:
According to the GPT-2 model, this is an example of a question: inform(outOfinform, Question, Directive, Commissive)
Just that, in this case, there is no further information or instructions given.

"
597,"that sounds fine, thanks for that. let's go ahead!","

This text is asking a follow-up question after the initial question was answered. This is characteristic for a commissIVE dialogue acts.

"
598,911 emergency. what is the problem?,"

This text is a request for emergency assistance. It is likely that the caller is looking for help or information, and is therefore seeking clarification or an explanation.

"
599,i would like to report a break - in.,"

Directive is a special type of question asking for a response. In this case, it is the directive that is being questioned. 
Question is another special kind of dialogueact. It is used to express uncertainty about the meaning of the message. The question mark is often replaced by a dash in the output. 
 - Why is there a 'break in' here? 
  - The speaker doesn't know.

"
600,when was this break - in?,"

This text is asking when the break occurred. This is an informational question and is not a command.

"
601,i believe it happened last night.,"

the text suggests that someone should go to the location and take care of the issue
this is an instruction, so the response should be directive

A:
According to this article, ""yes"" is the affirmative answer.

"
602,where was the break - in?,"

Question: was (the break) in which city? 
Information: the  break was in New York. 

 

In this example, because the information provided is not a request for a specific action, and does  not contain a timeframe, there was no question asked. The question was therefore classified  as question.

"
603,it happened at my house.,"

inform is a prediction label. It is not the actual dialogue acts of the conversation. The actual label of question is likely commissIVE. 
  
question is another prediction labels. Based on text and context, it is more likely that this is actually a direct question from recipient.

"
604,was anything stolen?,"

Question is an action question. It is used to make an inquiry or request for information. In this case, it is likely used in the context of a car theft, where the questioner is trying to find out if anything was stolen. 
  
Inform is a question that is asked to gather information about a particular topic. The inform question is typically used when the information is not relevant to the current conversation, but is needed for a different purpose. For example, a person might ask another person a simple question like “where is the nearest store?” to get basic information that they need to locate a store. 
Directive is action oriented. Directive questions are used for making requests or orders. They are spoken in a commanding tone, with a slight inflection of the voice.  For example: “stop the car” or “take out the trash”. 
 Commissive acts are performed by a third party to request or order from a superior. These acts can be performed verbally or non-verbally. An example of verbal commissives is “please”, which is spoken as a request. Non-verbal commissivites include gestures, body language, and facial expressions.

"
605,i haven't checked yet.,"

Mike is not asking K. to do anything, he is simply stating his identity, which is information. 
Directives are usually used in conversations to ask someone to perform a certain action, so commissives is the most appropriate dialogueact for this situation.

"
606,why do you think there was a break - in?,"

There was likely a short break in the communication due to the network congestion. 
  This is because there is no mention of a long break, and the use of ""What's Up?"" suggests that the conversation is still ongoing.

"
607,my front window was broken.,"

""Thank you"" is an example of gratitude. ""Thanking someone for doing something"" conveives information. 
Directives include commands, requests, and orders. The command ""fix the window"" does  not convey information, because it does require a response. 
 Commands include instructions for another person to follow. For example, ""Call the plumber"" requires a person (the caller) to do something (call the plumber). 
 Requests include requests for something from another.  For example ""Can you fix the door?"" asks for a service from someone. Committing to something requires action, for example by ""making a promise"". 
 Commitments include promises to perform an action. In this case, it is not clear what the promise is for, but it could be for the benefit of the person who was thanked, like ""I'll fix your window if it breaks again"".

"
608,we'll send a squad car shortly.,"

In the example above, ""they'll soon send squad cars"" is a command, not a request for information.

"
609,i'd appreciate that.,"

 commissives are used to express requests for information or action, and to make requests of others. In this case, it's likely that the speaker is asking the recipient to take the gift in their hand in just a few weeks, but hasn't specified whether they're asking for action (e.g., to buy, give, or do with the present) or information (such as the name of the store where the person can pick up the item).

"
610,excuse me. how much is the chocolate bar?,"

Because the ""the chocolatebar"" is not provided by the speaker, and the question is about something that is being asked for by another person. 
  

the Chocolate bar is 50 cents. please tell me what you want to do.

"
611,one dollar.,"

Inform (in the given text) is a directive dialogue action that indicates that the dialogue partner should take an action. In this case, it is likely that one dollar is the suggested action, as the dialogue partner is offering a price for the service provided. 
  
Question (question) indicates a dialogue request for information. As the price of the services provided is not mentioned in the provided text and the one-dollar price is suggested by the person providing the information, a request to the other party for clarification is implied.

"
612,"so, i can have five for five dollars?","

question is the correct classification as the dialogue acts of 'question' include asking questions, and the other classification options are not applicable in this case. 
inform is a request for information, not a directive or commissIVE. 
  question: is for questions that are asked for clarification or information.  
directive is used to give orders or instructions.   
commissive  is used by a person who is feeling angry or frustrated to express their feelings to another person.

"
613,"actually, you can only have four.","

the predicted label is not question or command because the dialogue acts of question and command are commissives and directive respectively. 
overinform is only used in negative contexts, where it means something is less than it should be. In this case, inform is being used to mean something more than just ""yes"".

A:
According to this article, there are only four possible dialogue actions: question (aka interrogative), command (command), directive (order), and inform(information).

"
614,"oh, yeah. i forgot tax. give me four then, please.","

Directive dialogue acts are used when the main purpose of the conversation is to give orders or make requests. In this case, it is clear that a request for information is being made, so a directive dialogue is appropriate. 
  
Overinform, questions, and questions about questions are all types of questions that can be asked in a conversation. However, this statement does not contain a direct question. It is more of an explanation of information that has already been provided. Therefore, overinform is a better fit. 
Question, direct, command: This is the most likely dialogue tag for this sentence. This type of dialogue occurs when someone is asking another person a simple question or giving another individual a specific order.  In this example, 'give me' is followed by a verb, therefore this is most closely aligned with a Command dialogue. 'exhaust gases' and 'printing presses' are both information provided by the previous sentence, however'exhaust gas' provides this information to the printing press, not the reverse. As such, these are not sufficient to form a Question. Additionally, there is no indication that 'gases' were produced by 'our printingpresses', so 'provide energy' to 'heat ourdryers' does nothing to indicate that exhaust gasses were utilized from 'ours'. Therefore the statement can only be classified a Commands.

"
615,okay. thanks.,"

the given textual content provides information that the performance wasn’t particularly well, rather than a direct question or command

Inform (Over Question, Directive, Commissive) is a dialogue-act label that is used to describe the content of a message that conveys information but does not ask for a response. This is because inform acts are often used in a request or order, and do not contain any content.

"
616,house keeping. may i come in?,"

directive is the most likely dialogueact given that the speaker is asking permission to enter the conversation

the phrase'may i' indicates that this is a request for permission, not a statement of fact
'come in' is an invitation to join a conversation, so the request is for the person being asked to 'come into' the current conversation.

"
617,come in please.,"

There is a question in this statement: ""i Can't deal..."". Based on this, we can assume that the information provided in between the two ""..."" is the reason why the dialogue acts are classified in that way. In this case, ""can't handle..."" could be considered a directive statement. However, there is not enough information in there to classify it as a commissIVE statement (directive, commisive), so it is classified here as question. 
  
Additionally, in ""it's not really..."", a commissive statement is expected, however, this is followed by a direct statement which is unexpected. This could point towards a Commissive-direct transition, where the CommissIVE is being asked to inform the direct of something that has happened.

"
618,"good evening, sir. i come to make the bed. shall i do it now or later?","

Question is used when the information provided is incomplete or ambiguous. The question mark indicates that the author is seeking clarification from the addressee. 
  
Overinform is when a speaker gives too much information to an addressees. This can be confusing or cause the receiver to overcomplicate things. For example, a salesman may overinform a customer about a new product, leading the customer to believe that they have a choice of several competing products when in fact there is only one product that is being sold. 
 commissives are used to give orders or instructions to someone. In this case, it is likely that a bed-making instruction is intended.

"
619,"well, since you have come, do it now please?","

Directives are used when giving someone instructions or recommendations. They imply that following the instructions will result the desired effect. For example, ""Call your mother and tell her that you will be home for dinner"" is an example of an instruction. ""Please bring a book for your brother on his next trip to town"" suggests that a suggestion will work better. 
  
In this example the directive is used to suggest a solution to a problem. The problem is not provided in the passage, so the suggestion is the only way to solve it.

"
620,that's all. have a nice stay here.,"

Inform is a less-likely response than the other four. The speaker does not want to know the answer, but instead wants to be directed to do something. In this case, it is likely that they want the person to look into the matter and then make their own decision.

"
621,thank you. please get some soap for us.,"

Thank you is a common expression used when expressing gratitude. 
It is also a request for something to be done. 
  Please get soap is another way of expressing this request.

"
622,just a moment. i will do it right now.,"

This text is not asking a direct question or giving a command. Therefore, it was classified under commissives. 
  
However, this is a positive statement expressing approval or opinion. As such, inform was the correct classification.

"
623,"ms. montgomery? this is richard thomas. i ’ m sorry to bother you at home, but i ’ ve got a bit of a problem.","

Question is a directive dialogueact, as it indicates the person asking is giving permission to continue. 
In this case, i am asking you to let me try one more time.

"
624,oh? what ’ s wrong?,"

Question is a dialogueact that indicates the speaker wants to know something from thelistener. In this case, it is the information thetext provided aboutthe object’s lengthand maximumspeed. 
Overinform is used when thespeaker is trying to give too much information to thelistener. This is because theinformation is overwhelming for the listeners. For example, if thelength of theobject is mentioned, a response of ten kilometers per hour isoverinformative. 
  
Inform is another dialogueAct that isused whenthe speakeris sharing information from memory. Here,the information provided by theoriginal text is alsoinform.

"
625,my daughter ’ s just banged up her knee pretty badly and i ’ m going to have to take her to the hospital. i ’ ll be about two hours late.,"

""i’m goingto haveto take my daughter tothe hospital"" does express the parent's opinion about the child's injury. However, it does so in the form of a command, not a request. A request would be ""can you take your daughterto thehospital?"". 
  
  The parent is likely going into the conversation with the intention of getting the doctor's advice or assistance. They are not asking a clarifying question or giving advice.

"
626,excuse me. i have an appointment with mr. li at nine. may i come in?,"

Directive is the most likely dialogueact given the context of the conversation. The person asking for permission to enter is an employee, and the appointment is with a manager. It is likely that they need to be let into the room to which the manager has access. 
  
Question is less likely, given that there are no other clues in the message that suggest this is indeed a request for information.

"
627,"yes, come in please. i am mr. li. you must be my liu, right?","

Mr. Li is a common Chinese surname. Mr. Liu is not a person, so it is unlikely that the writer of the message is looking for a Mr Liu. The writer is instead likely looking up a list of surnames and is trying to find a match. In this case, it seems likely that Mr Li was the intended recipient, and the question is therefore a request for clarification from the sender.

"
628,"yes, i am my liu. thanks.","

Because the dialogue text does provide information, and does so in a way that does neither ask questions, make commands, promises or commitments.

"
629,i'd like to start this interview with some questions. why do you think you are qualified for this position?,"

the text indicates the asker is asking for information, not making an assumption or a claim
it is a request for clarification, and the questioner wants to make sure the candidate understands the requirements for the position
this is not a directive or commissivo, as the latter two dialogue acts would be used to order someone to do something, whereas this is more like a friendly suggestion

based on this, i would predict the dialogueact of the response will be question.

"
630,"according to your advertisement, you want an experienced software engineer. i think my background meets the requirement of this position.","

""i think"" is a subjunctive form, indicating a hypothetical opinion. The speaker does not know whether their background is suitable for this job, so they have chosen to express their preference as a ""maybe"" or a conjecture. 
  

based on your text advertisement and the dialogue acts classification, i would like to invite you for an interview.

"
631,then tell me something about your background.,"

Directive is the dialogue acts that indicate that someone is giving information to another person. In this case, since the question is about availability, and the request is for background information (i.e. your history), it could be considered directive. 
Overinform is another dialogue action that indicates someone giving more information than they need. However, in this example, there is no need for the user to know the background of the system, so it cannot be overinformed. 
 
Question is also a possible dialogue actions, but it's not the most likely. The most common dialogue  acts for this type of question are inform and commissIVE.

"
632,"my major was computer science when i was at college, and i am quite familiar with visual c + + and java language.","

the text simply shares a factual information without giving instructions, commitments or asking any more details about tea being China's homeland. This is a typical behavior of a inform dialogue act

A:
According to the model, inform is one of the possible choices.

"
633,"well, what do you think about the development in computers?","

Question is a dialogueact that is used to seek information from a
  recipient. The sender in this example is trying to gather information
from the receiver. 
Overinform is another dialogueACT that indicates the information provided by the question is too much. In this case, it is likely that there is more information available to the reader than what is being provided. 
  The question asks for a general opinion, so the answer provided is not specific. However, if there was a specific question that was not answered, then the overinform dialogue ACT would be used.  

 commissIVE is the last dialogueAct that can be applied to this situation. It is typically used when the person asking the questions is commanding the response.

"
634,"the developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software. in some regions, the hardware is completely replaced by software. so i think the software industry has a great future.","

overinform: the question is too general and does not provide enough information to answer it. 
question: this is the correct dialogueact, since the person is seeking information. 
  directive: since this person wants to know something from you, this would be a directive dialogue-act. commissives: although this question does provide some information, it does so in a way that is not very specific, and therefore does little to help answer the original question.

"
635,have you ever designed any programs concerning network?,"

Question (question) is the most common dialogue acts for seeking information. In this case, ""have"" is a subject word, so the question mark is used to indicate that a statement is being asked. 
  
Out ofinform: This is an auxiliary verb used with a main verb to express purpose, direction, or intent. ""Have"" can also be used as a modal verb, indicating possibility or permission.  In this context, it is functioning as the auxiliary for ""network"". 
   
Have you EVER designed programs regarding network?
No, I have never designed a program regarding the network.

"
636,"yes, i have designed some programs for the network with visual c + + and i have passed the test for programmers - muse.","

In the context of the given text the prediction is correct. The given statement does imply a request or a recommendation, but does it seek information, pose a query, give orders, make commitments? No. Therefore, it is classified under inform.

"
637,have you got anything to ask me?,"

Question is a conversation act that is used to get information from another person. The question mark indicates that the speaker is trying to find out something from the listener. 
  
  Based off the provided information, it seems that this is an attempt to determine if the other person has any additional questions. If the person does have additional queries, then the question may be considered directive. However, if they do not have any further questions, than the query may instead be categorized as commissIVE.

"
638,"yes, can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position?","

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that express a request for action. In this case, it is likely that the person asking the question is looking for a specific action from the employee. 
  
Overinform: this is the opposite of directive. It is used when the requestor is expressing information to the responder. The responee is free to either accept or ignore the information. 
Question: the requester is asking for information, but the response is not guaranteed. For example, a person may be asking another person a direct question but is actually giving them an opportunity to talk about it. If the other person does not respond, then the first person can assume that person did not understand the original question. However, if the second person responds, that is considered a dialogue response. Therefore, this type is also considered question-asking dialogue.  However, there is no guarantee that a response will be given.   

Inform:  this is an example of direct request. There is some guarantee the the answer will come, however it may not be the action the asker is expecting. An example would be a supervisor asking an employee for help with a project. While the supervisor is clearly looking to get help from that employee, they may also be looking forward to a positive response so they can move forward with the project and the opportunity for the employees to help may actually be an incentive for that supervisor to complete the task. So, in summary, inform is both a yes/no question and a statement of fact.

"
639,"yes, of course. you would be responsible for the development of software products.","

Overinform: the software development is the developer’s responsibility. 
Question: what is software product development?  Does it include writing software code?
Directive: you will develop software  

 commissives: I will take full responsibility for developing the product.

"
640,i see. this is my advantage.,"

Out of question, question and directive, commissIVE, inform is the only one of the four possible classes that covers the meaning of ""I want"".

A:
According to the dialogue acts dataset, this dialogue is classified with inform.

"
641,good. have you got any other questions?,"

Question is a sub-class ofinform that is used to ask a specific question. In this case, ""are they only 20 per 12?"" is the question being asked. The other options are not used in this context.

"
642,no.,"

inform: the information sought is provided in the passage
question: is the question asked or answered?
Question: it's asked, and the answer is 'yes, I know'
directive: tell the person to do something
commissive : tell someone to tell another person something. 
In this case, it appears that ""yep, that's what I was going to ask you"" is an instruction to another speaker.

"
643,"ok, i will contact you in a week. see you.","

Directive is a special type of question that is used to request a
follow-up action or information. In this example, ""will you call me in
a week?"" is an example of a directive question used as a request for a follow-
up. 
  
Out ofinform: This is not an inform or question in the usual sense. It is more of an order or command. The speaker in this case is ordering the listener to do something. ""Ok, I will call you after supper."" is the example given.

"
644,"thank you, bye - bye.","

This text provides information on a dish. The provided information includes the main ingredients of the dish (red carp with rape and mushrooms). It does not ask a direct question or make a promise. 
  
Red cooked carps and rapes are two types of fish. They are often served with mushrooms, a type of fungi. Therefore, this sentence provides details of a food. This is a typical example of how dialogue acts can be used to classify text.

"
645,"tom, is jenny crying?","

Question is a dialogueact that is used to ask a question. It is also used in a conversation to make a suggestion to another person. 
  Based the given context, it seems like the question is being asked by jennifer to tom about whether Jenny is crying. If this is indeed the case, then it is likely that tom is offering to check on Jenny's well-being, and jenifer is declining the offer.

"
646,can you take he away from me?,"

It seems like the author is attempting to influence the choice of the
  recipient. The author suggests another option that is similar to the one
the recipient was considering, but the second option is better. In this
case, it is likely that the dialogue acts of question and directive are
not appropriate, as the question is about the availability of a third
option, and the directive act would be used if the first option was not
available. However, if we consider the possibility that this is a
substitute teacher asking for a student to be removed from the classroom,
then the act may be commissIVE, since the teacher is asking the student
to leave the class.

"
647,i ’ m just coming for that.,"

inform: This is just a general question about what someone is eating. It does not require an answer. 
question: I’m just wondering what you’re having for lunch. 
  This is a request for information, so it is classified here.  
directive: Please don’t eat that! You’ll get fat. You should eat more vegetables.   
 commissIVE: Don’T EAT THAT! I will KILL YOU!

A:
According to the Stanford Corenlp natural language processing toolkit, ""question"" is the most likely label for this passage.

"
648,she kept bothering me.,"

There are statements in this paragraph providing the name of the speaker, his/her place and birth date, graduation date and the major he/she is studying. These statements are not questions or directives. They are simply providing facts about who the author is and what he or she is doing. As such, it can reasonably be inferred that the statements provided are for the purpose of sharing facts, not for asking questions. 
  
In contrast, questions are typically statements that ask a question of a person or a group of people. For example, ""How are you?"" is a statement that provides facts to which the answer ""I am fine"" can naturally be an answer. In this case, since the question is about how the asker is, rather than how he is (i.e., the statement is not about sharing factual information), the classification of ""question"" is appropriate. 
Directives are also statements asking a direct question or making a request. However, they are usually followed by a time delay, which is typically not the case in our example. Directives can also be used to make requests, but in that case they should be placed at the beginning of sentences. The directive ""Please help me with this"" in ""Can you help with the problem I have mentioned?"" can make a reasonable request, while the directive placed in front of each sentence in a long text is redundant. Finally, commands are used for issuing orders to a machine or an agent. Since the order in question here is to the reader, a command is inappropriate.

"
649,she ’ s your sister. what she asked was only duck soup for you. why can ’ t you be good to her?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to elicit information from the other person. The question mark in the above text indicates the author is trying to get more information out of the person they are speaking to. 
  
  In this case, she is asking me why I can’t be more good. She is likely trying  to get me to explain to my sister why she should treat me better.

"
650,"but i am her brother, not her servant.","

I classified the dialogue acts as question because the first person is
seeking information from the second person. The second
person could be a servant or a relative. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, you classified inform as a directive dialogueact. But the inform is the most common dialogueAct in the question ""have you seen..."". So your answer is not correct.

"
651,"hello, where can i buy an inexpensive cashmere sweater?","

Inform: This is not a request for an information, but an apology. 
Question: It is unclear what the questioner is looking for. Perhaps the asker was looking to purchase a sweater at a discount, and this question is seeking clarification on whether such a thing is possible. 
  Alternatively, it could be a statement of fact, such as ""it is cold outside."" 

 

question: Is it possible to buy a cashmeran sweater for a price lower than $100? 
   
  
Yes, there are many inexpensive sweaters available. For example, a popular cash meran sweatshirt is available for $50.

  

 
  

   

 
   

"
652,maybe you should look around for an outlet.,"

Directive is the most likely dialogueact for this passage, as it is used to express a request or order. The sentence ""oh so does he"" is a directive sentence, in which the verb ""so"" signals a requirement or a wish. This is in contrast to the other options, where the meaning is more like a comment or request. 
  
  The sentence is asking a follow-up question: ""does he?"". In this case, ""he"" would be a third person singular pronoun, and the sentence would mean something like ""do you?"" or ""are you?"", which would require a response. However, if the question is not followed by a reply, then the response is often considered to be directive. For example, a teacher might say ""pay attention"" to a student who is paying attention, even if there is no reply.

"
653,that is a wonderful idea.,"

 commissives are used when the main speaker wants to make the other person do something. For example, if the first speaker says ""I want you to go to the store and get me a pack of cigarettes,"" the second speaker will likely hear "" I want/want you/you to/to go/go to to store get pack cigarettes.""

In this case, it seems like the person who wants two photos is the one giving the instruction, so the act should be commissIVE.

"
654,outlets have more reasonable prices.,"

In this example, we can see that while the writer is giving directions or instructions, they also are expressing an intention to purchase more affordable prices from outlets. This is an example of commissives, which are used to express a desire or intention that is not aligned with a question or an order. 
  
  Outlets has morereasonable prices: This could be a request for information, a suggestion, or a complaint.

"
655,thank you for your help.,"

This text is providing or indicating information about the situation. It does not seem to ask a query, give instructions or make a commitment.

"
656,no problem. good luck,"

This text is a polite response declining an offered suggestion. 
  Based the given context, it is classified commissively.

"
657,wow! your fruit looks really fresh! how much are these apples?,"

In this example, 'how much' is a direct question that is not covered by the other dialogue acts. Additionally, it is followed by a statement that can also be considered a response. Therefore, this is classified here as 'question'.

However, if we remove the statement 'How much?', the example text can still be classified using the same dialogueact.io model.

"
658,the apples are 30nt each. how many would you like?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to find out information or to request specific items. In this case, it is requesting a number, and the question is intended to elicit a response. 
  
Overinform, Question, Directive, Commissive: This text uses too many words to communicate a simple request. The sender could have simply asked ""How many apples do you want?"". This would have communicated the request more clearly and efficiently.

"
659,"let's see, 30nt is about... almost a dollar us. what?! how about these pineapples?","

In this example, ""pineapple"" is a noun, so it is likely that the speaker is asking a direct question. The word ""dollar"" may be a reference to the United States dollar, but it could also be an indirect question about the price of pineapple. 
  
If the word is not a word, it may also suggest that there is an unknown quantity or a quantity that is difficult to understand. In this case, a directive act may make more sense.

"
660,"they're 250nt each, but they're not edible. they're only used for worship.","

They're used only for Worship, so it's not likely that they would be considered edible (at least not in the traditional sense). 
If they were edible, it would likely be a violation of the Ten Commandments to eat them.

"
661,"hmm, 250nt is... 8 dollars?!! and you can't even eat them? you're crazy!","

Question dialogue acts are used to express uncertainty about the information provided in the conversation. In this case, ""is the price of 250 nuts really 8 Dollars?"". 
  
In this example, it's not clear whether the cost of the nuts is 8 USD or not. The speaker is asking a follow up question to confirm the answer they received.

"
662,wait! don't go just yet. these bananas are pretty cheap - - only 35nt for this bunch.,"

Directive is the most common dialogue acts in this context. It is used to request something from another person. In this case, it is likely that 'you' are asking the person 'how are' you. 
  
Out of directive: the 'and' phrase at the end of the sentence indicates that there is something after the question mark. So, based on this, 'out' of question is most likely.

"
663,"now that's more like it! bananas have lots of potassium, too!","

inform: the information is being provided voluntarily
question: is this information provided to me voluntarily?
directive: please share the details of yourfamily
comissive (also known as commissarial): please tell us aboutyour family!

"
664,"they're also good for your digestion! would you like some kiwis, too?","

yes you have, they're good to your digestive system!

In this example, yes you do provide a confirmation or piece  of information in the response. However, it is not a direct statement, a directive or a commissIVE. Therefore, this is a query in this case.

"
665,are they from taiwan?,"

Are they form taiwain? The question is looking for an affirmative or negative answer. An affirmative answer would be ""yes"", while a negative one wouldbe ""no"".

A:
According to the Stanford dialogue system, this is a Question.

"
666,they're imported from new zealand. four for 50nt. nine for a hundred.,"

Inform is used when the message is information being provided to a listener. 
  In this case, KARA is the listener, and Mike is providing his identity (he is introduced as ""Mike"").

Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive:
These are the possible dialogue acts for the sentence ""out what you're drinking?"". Out of these, only question and directive are used with the intent to make an offer.

"
667,ok. i'll take four kiwis.,"

There is a question in this line: ""why take kiwi?"". Based on this question and the subsequent answer, it seems like the speaker is asking the listener to take some specific action. This is not an information sharing situation. 
Directives are used when there is an action to be taken, but the action is given by the sender and not by a third party. For example, ""call the airline"" or ""meet me at the train station"".
Commissives can occur when the information being shared is considered confidential. In this case, a directive would be ""keep the info confidential"".

"
668,"amelia, could you spare a few minutes?","

Directive is the most likely dialogueact given the context. The speaker wants the listener to do something, so they use the directive form of the dialogue acts. 
In this case, it is likely that the headache is very severe and the patient wants you to call an ambulance.

"
669,sure. what do you need?,"

Question is a special type of informational request that seeks information. It is used to clarify or confirm information that has already been provided. In this example, it is clear that someone is providing information about a traffic violation, but the question is intended to confirm that they are indeed aware of the violation. 
  
Out ofinform: Out ofform is the opposite of form. Out-ofform indicates information was not provided, not given. The question in this case is out of-form, indicating that no information regarding the traffic offense was provided by the respondent. 
question: Question is one of four basic types of speech acts. All questions are informational requests. They are used for clarification or confirmation of information provided previously. Here, someone driving a vehicle through the red-light is being questioned about their knowledge or awareness of that action.

"
670,"well, i wanted to let you know that i've put in my notice.","

Inform is used when someone is giving information or providing information. 
  
  Out of the four dialogue acts, inform is the most common. It is also used in requests for clarification, when a person asks another for help or advice, and when an employee asks for a raise.

"
671,really? why?,"

Question is a sub-class of directive. Question can be used to ask a direct question to the listener. For example, ""Are you ready?"" can also be a directive question. However, inform is not a suitable dialogue tag for this example. The inform dialogue acts are used for sharing information, not for asking for a response. So in this context, this is actually a query, and the answer is ""yes"".

A:
According to this page,
question: Directive question
inform: Share information
directive: Give orders
commissive : Make promises
So, it seems that question is the right answer.

"
672,it's complicated. but basically it boils down to one thing. this company is downsizing and i can't continue working for a company that may let me go.,"

inform is used when someone is giving information to another person
question is often used for seeking clarifications or information
directive is for asking someone to do something
commissive (also known as command) is to issue orders to someone

A:
According to this article, there are 6 possible answers for any given text.  The article also provides a confidence score for each answer. 
I would recommend using the confidence scores to rank the answers and then selecting the top answer based on which one is most likely to match the actual intent of the conversation.

"
673,but surely they won't fire you! you're one of the most experienced managers here!,"

Overinform: This is a common mistake made by automatic text analysis systems. The inform text is about the task of picking the manager up at airport, and the system should have predicted that the user will ask about whether they will be fired. 
 Question: Does the employee get fired if they are caught lying?
 Directive: You should be careful what you wish for. You might get a promotion. 
 commissitive: I will try to avoid getting fired in the future.

"
674,"well, to be honest, there's another reason. i've got a better offer.","

Overinform: the model predicted that the next dialogue acts will be question or directive. 
  Question: I have this terrible pain in my head. What's wrong? 
   Directive: Please take me to the hospital. I think I've been poisoned.

"
675,well that's great news! congratulations! where will you be located?,"

Because the use "" why"" in the preceding text indicates the question mark, or interrogative, form of the word. This is because ""Why"" is a modal verb that indicates a hypothetical reason for an action, and is used in questions to introduce a statement, ask a follow-up question or introduce an explanation.

"
676,"the head office is in new york, but i'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time.","

Because the message is simply providing the information that was asked for, and the asker was not a direct questioner. The askers question was whether or not the company was based in the US. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Stalnaker, there are six basic types of acts that can occur in a conversation: question (which can be answered with a yes or no question), directive (a command), commissIVE (requesting information), apology (expressing regret), explanation (giving an account of something), and information (providing factual information).  The text you provided is a good example of an informative act.

"
677,"it'll be sad to see you go, but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity.","

inform: the dialogue acts for this part of text are overinform,
question: question is the correct dialogueact for the rest of it, since it's a request for information, and inform is used for a statement. 
directive: directive is not applicable, as the person asking is a third party, not the sender of message. commissives are not used in this context.

"
678,i have. i feel lucky. i look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use english more.,"

Out ofinform: the company is sharing information that is generally not shared with employees. 
Question: what has the energy usage in this factory been over this past 2 years? 

 

Inform: over a period of 2 consecutive years, we have been able to significantly reduce the amount of energy used in one of our factories.

 
  

Directive: you should do this. 
  

 
   

 
    

 
     

 
      

 
       

 
          

 
           

 
              

 
               

 
                 

 
                   

 
                     

 
                          

  

 

   

    

     

      

           

            

             

                

                   

                        

                     

                  

                    

                       

                      


 commissIVE: this is a significant reduction, and I am very happy about it.

"
679,"i'm sorry to bring this up, but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go?","

Directive is the most likely dialogueact given the context. The speaker asks the listener to do something, indicating that there is a question about the request. However, there are no questions being posed, so directive is likely. 
Out of directive and question: I don't know what the letter would be for, however, it is possible that you are referring to a recommendation letter for the admissions office at your school. If so, I would recommend writing the recommendation and sending it to the school before your visit.

"
680,"of course i can. in fact, if there are other job opportunities at this new company, i'll recommend you personally.","

Directives are often used in the context of job applications to indicate that the employer is committed to following up on a job application. In this example, it is likely that if the applicant does get a callback, they will be asked to either attend an interview or complete an application form. 
  
Informative text is often followed by a directive in order to provide the directive recipient with clear instructions or information. For example: ""Please find attached your new office address"" or ""Here are the details of your travel plans"". 
   
Question text may be followed either by an informative or directive text. If the question text contains a request for clarification, then it has a commissIVE dialogue tag. Otherwise, when the first statement in a conversation is a statement of fact or opinion, and the second statement is an opinion that is based on facts provided in prior statements, that text will have a QUESTION dialogue label.

"
681,thanks. i appreciate that.,"

based on this passage, inform is the most likely dialogueact. the passage states that the ""sender is providing  information about his own available"", and ""he is free to do so"". therefore, it is most reasonable to assume that he is informing the receiver of his availability.

"
682,what can i show you?,"

Question is the dialogueact that is most closely aligned with the type of question contained in the response. 
In this case, a request for information or clarification.

"
683,do you have this shirt in a small?,"

This text does not explicitly state that it is the husband who needs to purchase flowers. It could be the wife who is in need of flowers, or it could even be someone in the house who doesn't like the flowers and needs them removed. 
  
In addition, this is a request for clarification, so it does indicate that someone is asking a question. The shirt size is not specified, but it implies there could potentially be a smaller size available.

"
684,"let me check. yes, we have.","

""what they"" is an interrogatory pronoun, and is therefore classified in the question category. 
the sentence is structured as a request for information, further supporting this categorisation.

"
685,may i try it on?,"

Directive is the most likely dialogueact for this context, as it is used to request a service or action be performed. The sentence is a request for mayo to try on a shirt, and may is likely the speaker. 
  The sentence also contains information, such as the shirt size and color. This is necessary to make the request meaningful. Directive can also be used when giving orders, but in this case the order is clear from the context: ""Please try this shirt on.""

"
686,sure. let me help you.,"

This text seems to be asking questions, since it provides updates about its current status. However, it does not use any question words such as who, what, when, where, why, etc. Therefore, this is likely a commissIVE text. 
  
Sure, let ME help.

"
687,"the james ’ s file, christine?","

This text is asking a follow-up question and is therefore a request for confirmation. The inform and question dialogue acts are being used by the author to seek information from their recipient and to ask a yes/no question respectively. 
  

A:
According to the model, it is a confirmation request.

"
688,"i had it right here a minute ago, mr. emory. umm. just a minute...","

This is because the message is asking the person for information, and the receiver is the one who is supposed to provide it. 
Or, you could say that this is an example of over-informativeness, as the information the author is looking for is right in front of him/her.

"
689,"christine, i know you ’ re new here and there ’ s a lot to learn, but you are going to have to learn to keep your work in better order. we can ’ t afford to lose an important document.","

Directives are used when the information or action requested is not optional or depends on circumstances outside of the agent’s control. In this case, Christine is telling the employee that they will have a problem if they fail to maintain their workstation properly. 
  
Inform is used to request information that is optional and not required. The employee is free to do or not do what Christine asks. 
Question is the most likely dialogue tag for this passage. It is a natural question to ask, since the questioner is requesting information. However, it is also possible that directive could be a better fit, as the request is for action.

"
690,"yes, sir. i apologize for that. here ’ s the file you were looking for, mr. emory.","

This text does ask questions, and is therefore classified in the question dialogue category. 
It does give instructions, by using the word “here” three times, so it’s classified under the instruction dialogue type. However, it does also include a request for confirmation, as well as a directive element, making it a mix of both instruction and directive.

"
691,i wonder whether i could possibly borrow your new bicycle now.,"

Directive is a special kind of question that is used to request a service or action from the listener. In this case, it is likely that the speaker is asking the recipient of the message to lend the bicycle to the sender. 
  
Question is another special case of directive used when the action or service requested is for information. The recipient is expected to provide the information requested. This is because question is often used in conversation to seek information, and directive is only used for action.

"
692,"sorry, i'm using it myself. but you can use it this afternoon.","

Directive is the most likely dialogue acts given the context. The recipient is expected to use the tool, so the question is about when the receiver should use this tool. This is a directive message. 
  
Out of the four choices, only question and directive are questions. Therefore, this is most probably a dialog with a human.

"
693,thank you very much.,"

Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the most appropriate. The first sentence of your text provides an overview of how things are currently going for the author. This is an appropriate use of first person plural pronouns to share information. 
  
  Outgoing information is a special case of informational dialogue. Outgoing informational information conveys that the information source is giving information to a listener. In this case, it's the person who is updating you. 
Inform is also the correct dialogue tag for this sentence.

"
694,"thanks for inviting me to work out with you, joan.","

""that sounds good."" is an expression of a person's feelings or thoughts, and therefore falls into the ""information"" category. 
  
  Based off of the context of your conversation, it is clear that Joan is trying to convince you of something. Joan says ""it does sounds like a good idea,"" which indicates that she is offering her opinion on something, or trying convince others of her thoughts.

"
695,"don't mention it, let's go in.","

""i love the way you talk"" (question) is asking a direct question. 
It is not possible to love something you were not informed of. Therefore, this is a commissIVE dialogueact. 
  
  ""you talk so good""  (directive)  is telling the person that you would like them to talk more. This is an example of a conversational directive.  It does NOT ask for information, so it belongs in the directive dialogue category.

"
696,"yeah, this place looks great. wow, look at her, she can certainly get down, can't she?","

Question is a more specific form of inquiry. Question words are more likely to be followed by an answer than are non-question words. 
In this example, ""can't"" is the question word. ""Can she?"" is an example of a non question question.

"
697,"she sure can. are you jealous, leslie?","

Question asks for an explanation. The statement'she surely can.' does
  not provide one. 
  
Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both correct, but inform is more specific and should be used. 
Quit questioning me, Leslie. I'm not a child. You're the one who's acting childish. She sure does. Are youjealous, Lesli? 
   
Directive: this is a request for a response. 'She sure  can.' should have been a directive response to 'Are you Jealous Leslie?'. Leslie should've responded with 'No, I am not jealous.'. However, since the question mark was not included, 'Leslie sure sure' was the closest response and was classified here.  

"
698,"a little, i wish i could do that.","

inform: little i want to share something with u. 
question: what is the meaning of ""what is"" in the above sentence?
directive: please share what you want. 
 commissIVE: i don't know how to say it. please teach me.

"
699,you can! with a little practice.,"

This text indicates the speakers intention is for someone to do something, so the dialogue acts of question and inform are not applicable. 
However, there is no indication that this is a request for information or a directive. Therefore, it is classified here as a commissIVE.

"
700,"look at him, he's buff.","

overinform: This dialogue acts indicates that the sender is simply seeking information from their recipient. The recipient is never told that they have to do anything, so this is overinformative. 
question: this dialogue is asking the receiver a question. However, there is no indication that this question is being asked of the person, rather it's just a general question that is asked. 
 directive: the message is telling the other person what to think or do. This is commissIVE.  

A:
According to the model, this message seeks a reply or a suggestion. A reply would be ""yes, soup sounds good"" or ""soup sounds delicious, what else do you have?"". Suggestion would include ""you could try it, maybe it would taste good to you"".

"
701,i think he's hot too.,"

""hot"" is a characteristic trait of a person, not a dialogueact. 
the text is not asking aquestion, giving acommand, making apromise, etc. instead it is sharing information.

"
702,how do they all get in such tiptop shape?,"

'they' are a non-specific, plural pronoun.  It could be a generic reference to multiple people, but it could also be an individual person. If it's an specific person, then it would be more likely a direct question. 
'tiptops shape' could mean that the person is in good physical shape. But it also could refer to the shape of the sentence, where the subject and verb are in the present tense. This is a typical construction for questions. 
  

In general, a good rule of thumb is to look at the word order in a sentence. Does the main verb (in this case, 'are') come before or after the auxiliary verb ('in good shape')? If the verb comes after, it probably is the focus of a main question; if the reverse is true, look for a directive or commissIVE dialogue.

"
703,exercised over and over. exercise is a key.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the dialogue act does not include a request or command, but rather an expression of information. The speaker wants to share all of the information, so the command or order is not necessary.

"
704,that's it. i decided to turn over a new leaf. i'm going to exercise every single day.,"

Because the message expresses gratefulness and expectation for the future, it does NOT ask any questions, make any commands or promises.

"
705,"good for you, leslie!","

Sure, John sandALS. seems like it's providing or verifying information about the person or thing mentioned. This is a confirmative statement, so the dialogue acts over-classified as confirm.

"
706,excuse me. check please.,"

Directive acts are used when the speaker is trying to get the listener to take an action. In this case, it is the florist asking the customer to check the cost of the flowers. 
  
Out ofinform: This is a directive act, but the information requested is not for the purpose of getting the other person to do something. It is for getting information from the first person. 
Question: the question mark indicates the act may be a request for clarification, or a statement of doubt. The florists request the customers to confirm the prices of their flowers, however, this is unclear.  It could be that they are asking too much, that is, they want to negotiate the total cost,  or it could mean that there is some confusion about the nature of flowers and their price.

"
707,"ok, how was everything?","

Question is an inquiry response. 
Out ofinform: This is a statement asking a follow up question

question: Did you enjoy your meal?   ok: yes, it was delicious. 
   

Inform: Information is provided to the receiver to help them make a decision or take action. In this case, 'Did you Enjoy your Meal?' is providing information to recipient to let them know what was served.  
                                      question : Did You Enjoy Your Mealt?                      ok: Yes, It was Delicious.

 Question: Directive: this is the message sender telling the Recipient what to do. In this instance, ""Enjoy your meals?"" is telling Reciever to enjoy their meal.                 
                                                                                                 Directive : Enjoy the meal!

                                                 

                 Commissive (order): This message is sent to a group and is meant to convey a message or order. Commissives are used when a sender wants to give a Reciver instructions or when two or more Recivers need to follow a specific order or procedure. "" Enjoy  your meals? "" is Commissing to Recievers to Enjoy their meals in an orderly fashion.                                                                    

 
                                   

"
708,very nice. thank you.,"

the text provides information regarding the result of the test;
it is neither a direct question nor a command.

"
709,would you like this to - go?,"

In the first sentence, rest implies that someone is doing something against their will. The speaker suggests that rest be the action the receiver takes, to go. 
  
  In this second sentence the prescription suggests the course the listener should take, writing something down. Again, this is against the rules of the dialogue, so question is the most appropriate classification.

"
710,"yes, can you put it in a plastic bag?","

Directive is a special kindof dialogue acts that indicate that a speaker wants something to be done by the listener. In this case, Plastic bag is the action that needs to happen. 
Overinform: This is an over-informing dialogueact that indicates the information provided is too much. Placing the food in the plasticbag is not a big deal. 
  Question: this is also a questioning dialogue action. The question is, why is it necessary to put thefood in plastic bags? 
   Directlyive:  This is another directive dialogueaction.  The speaker want's this action to take place.   
  Comissive : This type is commissives dialogue actions. It indicates a conversation is getting heated and will likely not continue. Here the use of plasticbags is being used as a physical altercation.

"
711,"sure, no problem. here you are. that'll be 25 dollars.","

 commissives are used to express requests for information or opinions. 
  They are not used for giving orders or recommendations.

"
712,do you take credit cards?,"

I do not take any credit card. I do my best to live a sustainable life. 
  I believe in sharing what I have with others. By not taking credit
  cards, I am able to do this.

"
713,"yes, we accept visa and mastercard.","

inform: the first person is not clearly identified, so it is classified over inform. 
question: what is visa?
directive: please perform the action
commissive : we will accept the payment

A:
According to your explanation, you can classify the inform as overinform.

"
714,"ok, here you are.","

 commissives are often used when asking for information or direction. In this case, it is likely that a commissIVE is being used to request that you choose between two options (smoking and non-smooking). 
  
Out of Inform: ""Would you rather smoke or non smoking?""
Question: Do you want to smoke, or not?
Directive: Please make your choice. 
          
Over Informed: I would like to choose.

"
715,thanks. i'll be right back.,"

 commissives are often used to express strong feelings such as anger, urgency, or frustration. The use of commissIVE in this example indicates the writer is frustrated with the recipient's lack of response to their greeting.

"
716,ok.,"

This is a commisive act, as it is used to make a request or request for something. The text does not provide information nor make knowledge claims. Therefore, it should be classified a commissIVE act. 
  

A:
According to this article, Commissive acts are: 
1. Requesting for Information
2. Making a Knowledge Claim
3. Giving Instructions
4. Expressing an Opinion

"
717,here's your receipt.,"

Because the receipt text contains a directive (give this to them), a commissIVE (make a commitment) act, and the information provided is not question- or directive-based.

"
718,thank you.,"

inform: the receiver is not expected to answer this question
question: who is this person?
directive: please ask the person who this is
 commissIVE: this information is available on wikipedia

A:
According to your explanation, I think the dialogue acts of the example text are: 
""know"" is a ""question""
is a a verb, so it is ""inform"" 

 

So the answer is: ""yes, there is more than one category of China tea""

"
719,you're welcome. please come again.,"

In this example, it is not clear whether or how the question was asked. However, based on context, we can assume that the speaker is seeking clarification from the listener. Therefore, this is a directive dialogue.

"
720,"you look upset, anything wrong?","

based on this part of the conversation: ""anything wrong?""
the text seems to be asking a follow up question: anything specific wrong that you are concerned about? 
  Based this assumption, I would classify the response as an answer to the question ""Anything specific you want to tell us?"".

"
721,i'm going to quit the job.,"

In this example, inform is the correct dialogueact prediction because the response provides a reassurance that the speaker is not goingto quit their job, but rather is going ""to"" quit. The response doesnot ask any questions, does give directives (such as ""quit""), ormake commitments.

"
722,why?,"

out inform: the sender is seeking information to provide context for the question
question: this is the main dialogueact of the passage
directive: it's a request for a response
 commissIVE: as the last dialogue acts in a passage, it indicates the speaker is expecting a reply

A:
According to the Oulou tea definition, oolong is long-fermented tea that is not compressed. Compressed tea is tea which is compressed after fermentation.

"
723,the task is tough.,"

overinform is a sub-class of question that indicates that the speaker is providing too much information. In this case, it's likely that this is the first time the user is hearing about the drugs, so the information provided is too overwhelming. 
question is another subcategory ofinform that is used when the listener is seeking clarification. The recipient of the message is likely asking the question ""are all these really drugs?"", which indicates the use of aquestion. 
  

Overinform and Question are both subcategories of Question.

"
724,you'd look before you leap.,"

inform: This is an information-seeking dialogue, where the speaker is seeking information about the listener's knowledge, preferences, or needs. 
question: this is where someone is trying to find out information, but is not sure of the answer. The question may be based on a personal experience, and the asker is looking for confirmation. 
 question: I wonder if this will work. I've tried it before, it didn't work so well.  
directive: here the person is telling someone else what to do. They are giving orders. In this case, there does not appear to be a request for assistance. Rather, this appears to me as a directive. It is likely that this person was trying the dishwasher and it did not work, so they are telling the other person to try it again.   
 commissIVE: in this instance, someone was asking for service and was not getting it. So they were expressing their dissatisfaction with the service they received. Here, I believe the word commissives is used to describe a negative sentiment.

"
725,thanks for your concern.,"

""iknow it doe"" indicates that the speaker has an awareness of what is being said, similar to a statement of fact. This is a characteristic of a declarative statement. 
  
  ""that is because its is"", on its own, is not a complete sentence, but is an incomplete statement that can be interpreted as a confirmation or explanation. In this case, it can reasonably be understood as an expression of understanding or agreement.

"
726,how long will you stay in new york?,"

This text can also be considered to be a statement since it contains a complete thought. The question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the statement is not complete. Therefore, this is considered a non-verbal statement. 
  

A non verbal statement can have different meanings. Based on context, a listener can infer the meaning of a verbal or non verbals statement, and use this information to make a decision. For example, in the following statement: ""The sky is blue"", the listener may infer that it's a sunny day, or that someone is trying to sell them something.

"
727,just tor three days. i won't need these luggages. couid i put them here?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact of the four because the sentence is asking the listener for confirmation/clarification. 
  The person asking appears not to know what they need, so they're seeking clarification.

"
728,"i am sorry. if you have here more than 24 hours between connecting flights, we can't check your luggage through london.","

 commissives are used when the sender is trying to get the receiver to do something, but the message is not clear on what to actually do. For example, a waiter might ask a customer if they would like a drink, when it is actually the customer's drink that they want. 
  
In this case, it appears that someone is asking someone else to go buy weed, however, this is unclear from the sentence. The sender could be asking the person receiving the request to find someone to sell weed to, or they could simply be trying out a new request and are looking for a yes or no answer.

"
729,"well, maybe i can put them in the airport storage there.","

 commissives are often asking someone to do something, so this makes this a commissIVE request. 
the informer is the person asking the question and the asker of the questions. So this is a informational commissitive request, meaning the inform is directive. 
  The question is about the eating habit of someone, and it is therefore a questioin.

"
730,that's right. it's over there.,"

Overinform: This is a prediction based on a single sentence in the passage. The sentence provides general information, and does neither ask nor give any directives. 
Question: the statement does provide general, non-committal information. However, it does ask the reader to locate something. 
  Directive: this is not a dialogue structure. Rather, this structure is used to give instructions to a machine. Commissive is also not applicable here.  

A:
According to your explanation, I think that the inform dialogue acts are overinform and question.

"
731,eat some more.,"

the text does provide confirmation or information in the response. 
it does ask question by using the word 'why' in it.

"
732,"no, thanks. i'm on a diet.","

Inform is a directive dialogueact, as it is used to request information from the other person. In this case, it's the speaker who is asking thelistener for information. 
Question is another directive act, used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision. It's used here to find out if the person who provided theinformation is also asking themselves if they should be sharing this information with the rest of the group. 
  Directive is an act used for asking someone else to carry out an action. Here, this person is the one who should carryout the action, and inform is being usedto request that the  listener shares information that is relevant to the current situation.  
Commissiveis an expression of emotion used in response to a request for action or information, where the emotion is one that motivates the actor to take some action in order to meet the request. This is typically used as a result of a question or directive.

"
733,excuse me. do you know where the admiral hotel is?,"

Question is used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision. In this case, it is likely that there is more information needed to answer the question. 
  

Inform is when there isn't enough information to decide on an answer, but the answer is needed for decision-making. The information is being provided to help make decisions. 
Directive is a directive instruction to do something. It is often used in situations where there are multiple options and the person giving the instruction is making the decision for everyone. For example, ""Stop the car!"" or ""Get out of my way!"".  It is also used to give instructions to a subordinate. ""You need to clean up this room!""
Commissive indicates a request for something from another person. Often used as a sub-type of request.

"
734,"that's over on callaway street, isn't it?","

""over"" is a relative clause that modifies the relative pronoun ""which"", which refers back to inform. Based on this construction, inform is the most likely dialogue tag. 
question is also a likely tag, as the sentence contains a main clause with a subject and a verb, and the verb is in the present tense, indicating a request or question. 
  

I believe they're on Callaway Street.

"
735,"yes, but i can't find callaway street.","

Callaway Street is a street in the city of callao in Peru. Callaway is the surname of a family that has owned a large number of golf courses in callaoville, and the family still owns and operates the Callao Golf Club. The street is named after the first family member to reside in Callaos.

"
736,walk that way for about four blocks. the hotel's about two blocks north of there.,"

the given statement is an example of a declarative statement, where a speaker provides information without asking aquestion, giving aninstruction, making apromise, so itis classifiedas inform. 
However, based on your description, it does ask for assistance, and is therefore classified over inform as it requires an assistance to be performed.

"
737,thanks a lot.,"

This text suggests that speaker intends to share their information in future about performing a task. Hence, this is the reason why.

"
738,not at all.,"

inform: indicates that a subsequent dialogue turn will provide more information. 
question: suggests that there is a question that needs to be answered. 
  
directive: implies a request for a response.  It is not possible to tell from this sentence whether the directive is being given to another person or is the direct speech act.   
commissive : implies an action that is expected to occur in the future. It is possible that this is an instruction to someone else, but it is also possible this could be a future action.

"
739,i'm sorry i'm late.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification because there is no question being asked, a new commitment is being made, nor is there any new or different information being provided. Rather, there was a confirmation of something that had already been stated.

"
740,better late than never.,"

Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are closely related, so it is difficult to tell which one came first. In this case, inform is the more likely parent. 
Question: is it possible that question came before inform? If so, then inform would be a descendant of question. However, in this example, it seems more probable that inform came after question (based on its temporal proximity to the preceding subjunctive). 

 
overinform
question
inform

"
741,"professor li, do you know where to buy art supplies?","

""where to Buy Art Supplies"" is used as a query, indicating that the speaker is seeking information or clarification. 
In addition, ""Art Suppliers"" appears in the sentence as an object, suggesting that this is the topic of the query. 
  Based off of these clues, it appears that ""where"" and ""art supplies"" are being discussed, and the question is ""Where can I buy Art supplies?""

"
742,for what? are you taking up painting?,"

This is not a clear question and is more of an inquiry. The question mark is used to emphasize the speaker is seeking clarification. 
  
  The text does not ask for a specific action, but rather is inquiring about something. This is an interrogative sentence. An interrogatives sentence typically indicates a request for clarification or information.

"
743,no. i can't paint. i'm asking for my niece. she is really into it.,"

Inform is used when the information being provided is not sensitive. For example, when a person is asked for their name, they are informally asking ""who are you?"". 
  
Question is when someone is being asked a question but is also expressing a desire or willingness to provide an answer. This is often used in the context of a request for information. The questioner is expressing their desire to know something and the answerer is giving their best effort to answer the question. If the answer is negative, then the response is a ""no"" or ""certainly not"". If they give a positive answer, their response could be a yes or maybe. In some languages, a response of ""I don't know"" is considered a negative answer and is treated as a rejection.

"
744,"oh, good. how old is your niece?","

the text asks a direct question about age
question is a special type of directive dialogue acts that are used to ask questions
overinform is another special category of dialogueact that is used when the speaker is providing too much information

In this case, because the age of the niece is relevant to the conversation, it is reasonable for the user to provide an answer.

"
745,"she is eight. actually, i'm buying a good set of art supplies for her as a birthday gift.","

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the sentence expresses the desire of the author to provide information about a gift for a child. The sentence also contains the word actually which suggests the information provided is likely to be incomplete. 
  
Question: What is she?

Directive: I'm going to buy a set for art materials for she as my daughter's birthday present.

  Question (based on text): What's she (age)?
  Directives are instructions or requests. They are used to express a wish or desire. In this case, it is requesting the gift be purchased for the child (she).

 Directive (question): I’m going...

 Question (directive): To buy...
A request is an order or instruction to perform a task. It is used when the person requesting something does not have the ability to do the task themselves. This is because they are asking someone else to carry out the action for them. For example:
She is going shopping for clothes. I would like to go with her but I am not sure I will be able to afford it. Would you be willing to lend me some money?

   Request (request):  I’d like... (verb)

 Request (requests): Would...  (verb and subject)
Commissive is another type of dialogue acts. Commissive acts are often used in arguments. An argument is when two or more people are debating a point or presenting opposing viewpoints. When an argument becomes heated, a commissitive act may be used by one of those people to end the argument. A commissative act can be seen as an attempt to persuade the other person to see things the way they do. Commissive act are not always negative. Some commissives can also be considered as requests to calm down or to consider another point of view. 
I think you should buy her a present instead of giving her art material. She will enjoy it more. You can give her the present later. If you buy it now, she will not be happy because she is waiting for it and she does like the idea of getting a new present but if you wait until later she may not like it because it will have been sitting in her closet for too long. So I suggest you give it to her now.  

 Commissitive (argument): She should not buy art stuff for herself. (advice) 
   Comissitive: You should give the art present to she now

 Comissative: It will make her happy. And it's the right thing to give a girl a special present on her birthday.   

 Commssive : It's ok to gift a beautiful present for your girlfriend on your birthday

"
746,it's a wise thing to do. art will do a child a world of good.,"

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as it indicates that Art will write a letter to the child. This is a good thing, since Art should do the world a favor by writing the letter. 
  
Question indicates a desire for further information. 
Directive indicates Art is telling the kid to take a nap and eat some fruit. The kid should follow Art's instructions.  
 
 commissitive indicates there is an instruction for Art to write down. Art can continue with his letter writing.

"
747,hello?,"

'thankyou verymuch' can be classified a statement of appreciation, not a request for information. 
It is a single word, so it does not require the use of punctuation to separate the words. 
  'Thank you' could be considered a declarative sentence, but it could also be a simple statement.

"
748,"hi, mr. smith. this is mary. is jenny there?","

Question indicates the person is requesting information
Out of the four possible dialogue acts, Question is the most likely. The person asking about the other person's diet is likely seeking confirmation.

"
749,"no, i ’ m afraid not, mary. may i take a message for her?","

Mary is a person mentioned in the passage. Directive dialogue acts are typically used when someone is talking to a third party (e.g. Mary) and is giving instructions or requests. In this case, Mary is the third-party receiver of the message. 
  
In contrast, Commissive and Question dialogue Acts are used to express requests or questions to the person being talked to (the sender). In the example above, May I take the messages for Mary? is considered a CommissIVE dialogue Act.

"
750,"yes, please tell her that band practice has been moved to tuesday night at eight thirty.","

Band practice is being moved. 
This is a directive message, not an informational message. 
  Therefore, we predict a reply of directive.

"
751,o. k. no problem. anything else?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to probe for information, and are often used in a conversation to test whether the other person is able to understand what you are saying. For example, ""Are you sure you want to do that? It might not be a good idea."" or ""I didn't know you were going to be away for the next few days. Do you need anything while you're away?"". 
  
Overuse of question dialogue Acts can make the conversation feel more like a test than a natural conversation. If you find yourself using question too often, try asking for clarification or providing additional information to make your message more clear.

"
752,"no, but if she has any questions, she can call me at 555 - 2345.","

inform is used when someone is giving information to another person, and they are not asking questions. 
question is when a person wants to know something, so they ask a direct question. 
  

In this example, inform is being used, because the speaker is not directly asking the question but instead giving the information that she is offering.

"
753,"all right, i ’ ll leave her the message, mary. thanks for calling.","

Mary is asking questions, providing additional information to the caller, and making commitments.

"
754,thank you. bye.,"

In this example,'may i' is used as a polite request for permission. The use of 'i' indicates that the request is being made on behalf of the listener, and is therefore considered to be a more polite form of request.

"
755,goodbye.,"

Out of question: the dialogue acts question and command are not applicable as the response is not asking or commanding anything. 
Question: when I spread this out, I found a  hole. This is a factual statement about a past event. The speaker is sharing a discovery they made. 
  Therefore, this is classified a inform act.  
Command: I want you to go to the store and get me a pack of cigarettes. In this example, there is an order to get something for the listener. However, in this case, since the order is for a friend, and the friend is also not present, then the command is invalid.

"
756,do you speak english?,"

Inform: This is not a request for assistance, but rather a statement of fact. 
Question: It is possible that this person does not speak English, and is looking for an interpreter. 
  Question is the most likely dialogueact in this situation, since it is seeking information.

"
757,"yes, a little.","

Overinform: the prediction is incorrect, there actually is no trafficjam. 
Question: is there a possibility of traffic jams?
Directive: slow down
Commissive (sometimes used instead of commissitive): let me call the driver of the car. 
  I’ll tell him to slowdown.

"
758,can you tell me how to get to the jade buddha temple?,"

Directive is the most specific dialogue action, and indicates that the sender has already made a decision and is going to follow through with it. In this case, we can assume that 'the jaded bud Buddha temple' is a destination, so the person asking the question is likely going there. 
Overinform indicates the information provided is too much, which makes the receiver feel overwhelmed and makes them question the source of the message. Here, since the asker is not sure where to go, they are over-informing the respondent. 
  
Question indicates there is some uncertainty in the content of what is being asked for. The askers lack knowledge of where the bud dharma temple is, hence the uncertainty.

"
759,i'm sorry. i can't quite follow you. would you mind speaking slowly?,"

In the example provided, I believe the speaker is asking the listener to speak more slowly. The speaker seems to be frustrated that the information being shared is not making sense to them, and they would like the other person to slow down their speech so that it is easier to follow. 
  
  Directives are often used when the main character is frustrated or confused, so it makes sense that this would be the case here.

"
760,how do you get road news?,"

Question is characteristic that the message is looking for information from its recipient. 
Overinform is another term for this, where the sender is providing too much information to the recipient, overwhelming them.

In this case, it is asking for road information. 
  
  Question can also be used in a negative way, to express a request to stop or stop talking.

"
761,i've a driver mate in my car!,"

""The giventext providesinformation aboutthe currentsale price,"" indicatesthat thespeaker issharing orinforming thelistener abouta particulardetail.Thereis noquestion beingasked,noinstruction ordirectivebeing given,"" therefore,the natureof thistext alignstherenature of""inform"".

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible dialogue acts for a given sentence: question (Q), answer (A), command (C), or request (R). The answer is the most common, appearing in about half of all sentences. The command is next, followed by a request in roughly a quarter of sentences and the other two are question and answer, each appearing about one-third of the time.

"
762,so you have all the news on broadcast?,"

Inform: This is not a request for confirmation. The sender merely wants to provide the information. 
Question: Based on this inquiry text it is reasonable to assume that this is a questioning text. 
  Questioning texts often contain a topic or a set of topics that are being questioned. In this case, it appears that there is only one topic, ""the truth"". This topic is being asked about by the question mark.  
Directive: It is possible that in this situation the directive dialogue acts apply. However, this seems unlikely. Directives are typically used when there are multiple actions that need to happen in a specific order. Here, there appears only to one action, so it seems more likely that Commissive applies. Commissives can be used to express a wish or request. It does not appear that a CommissIVE is needed in the example provided.

"
763,"yes, it's so helpful.","

inform: This is an informational text. It is not asking a direct question but is providing useful information about something. 
question: this is the most likely dialogueact, as it indicates the asker is interested in knowing something
directive: the author is telling the reader what to do, for example, click a link
 commissIVE: it could be a command, but it also could mean the opposite, that it was a comment on something

"
764,can i help you?,"

I was going to a party and was pulled from my car over the speed limit. I asked the officer for his name and badge number, but he did not provide them.

"
765,"yes, i'm in a bit of a rush. could i have a piece of apple pie please?","

Apple pie is typically a commissively requested item.
In this context, 'a bit' could be interpreted as a request for a small portion, and 'of' is used to indicate a portion of something larger. 'A piece' of pie could then be understood as an amount of less than a whole pie. 
  

A:
According to the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit, this is the correct classification: 
Directive: applepie
Question: what for?

"
766,certainly. would you like it with ice cream?,"

Question asks for clarification. The person is asking if the listener would like the dessert with or without ice-cream. 
Overinform: the response includes a detailed description of the icecreamy dessert. This is over-informing the asker of their preferences. 
  Question: Would you prefer the cake with icing or the one without? 
 Commend: This response encourages the speaker to continue to provide good service.

"
767,"no, thanks.","

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the conversation is still in the introductory phase. However, it is not certain that question or directive is also part of the dialogue. It is possible that commissives is more appropriate, since the exam is being conducted by the doctor, but it could also be commissively directive.

"
768,i'd like to make an appointment with dr. cooper. could you arrange it for me?,"

Dr. Cooper is a physician and the person who is in charge of scheduling appointments. Based on this context, it is likely that Dr. Coopers will ask you to arrange an  appointment for you.

"
769,yes. would tomorrow morning be all right with you?,"

Directives are used to ask someone to do something, usually to the person's own advantage. In this example, 'tomorrow morning' is a directive asking the speaker to wake up at a certain time. The speaker is the one who is being asked to benefit from the directive. 
In this case, tomorrow is not a good time for the speakers to be awake, so the 'would tomorrow' part of 'Tomorrow would be ok' indicates that the time is uncertain. This is why the next day is suggested.

"
770,"sorry, i've got a meeting from nine to ten. what about monday afternoon?","

Directive is a dialogue acts that are used to request a service or action from the other party. In this case, it is used as a way to change the subject of a conversation. 
  
  In this example, if the response was given by the person who is meeting the driver, then the directive dialogue would be changed to inform.

"
771,i'm afraid he's fully engaged. could you make it another time?,"

directive is used to ask someone to do something, or to tell someone what to
do, especially when that person is not expected to agree to it

A:
According to the dialogue acts dataset, this is a directive dialogue.

"
772,hey! what are you doing here?,"

Question is used to request information from the listener. The use of question in this context indicates that the person asking is looking for an explanation or justification for something. 
  
In contrast, directives are used when someone is asking someone else to do something, and the directive is not dependent on a response from that person. In this case, it appears that someone (presumably the one asking) is holding something for another person (the one being asked to take care of it). This indicates commissiveness, not question.

"
773,i'm just shopping.,"

""i’m just browsing"" is an example of a non-questioning inform statement, as it indicates the speaker is just looking around and does not have an opinion or question about the matter. 
On the other hand, ""I know you just bought a new car.  That’s because I just saw you drive off in it."" is a questioning statement that indicates that the person speaking is asking for confirmation or an answer to a previous statement.

"
774,what are you shopping for?,"

Question: the dialogue acts that are most likely in a request for information are question and directive. The first is likely used when someone is confused and needs clarification, and the commissives are likely to be used in an order or request. 
  
Overinform: this is used to describe when a person gives too much information. In this case, it is most like that this person was confused, so they asked for clarification. 
Questions: in this example, this type of question is unlikely, as the question mark indicates the speaker is uncertain. Instead, we can assume this was a statement that was unclear. This type is also used for when people are just being polite and giving too many details. They are not expecting a response.  

"
775,some new clothes. how about you?,"

Question is a sub-type of inquiry, which is asking a specific question about something. In this case, it is about whether the person is okay or not. 
  
  Out of question and question are both sub types of directive. Question is used to ask questions, while out of is usually used in negative sentences. Based on this, we can say that question is likely to be used here. However, there is no specific mention of a direct question in this sentence. Hence, out is the most likely choice.

"
776,same here.,"

based on this sentence: ""Which condiments do  you use?""
the text is asking about condimants.

"
777,have you found anything nice yet?,"

Question is a directive act. It is used when the sender wants the recipient to do something. For example, ""Have you ever found a nice place to eat?"" would be a question because the asker is expecting the answer ""yes"" or ""no"" and wants to know the location of the place. 
  
Overinform is another possibility. This is when a message is too detailed or provides too much information. In this case, there is not a request for a follow-up action, so the dialogue acts should be commissives.

"
778,i found a few pairs of pants.,"

In this case, inform is the correct classification because the message provides or informs something, characteristic for inform. 
Note that the classification is not 100% accurate, as it can be difficult to determine the exact meaning of words or phrases in a different language.

"
779,where'd you get those?,"

Question is used in this example to indicate that a directive request has just been made. 
  The speaker has asked the questioner to tell him where he got the information from. This indicates a request for information and is therefore a question.

"
780,i found them at jc pennies.,"

Inform (in, inform) is a directive dialogueact used when the
  speaker is providing or requesting information. 
  
Question (question) and question are used to ask for or request information from the listener. 
Directive (direct, out of, direct, order, direction, command) are
used to give orders to someone. In this case, it is the person requesting the information that is being commanded to look into the document.  
 
 commissives (comissive, may, i, have, a, look, at, document) can be used as a
request for permission. This is used in situations where the request is
for a favor or benefit. The speaker may or may not be asking for a direct
benefit. For example, ""i would like to speak to the manager, please have
him call me"" is commissived to ""may i speak with the director,
please have him call my cellphone"".
 

"
781,those are really cute.,"

overinform: This is a negative classification, meaning that inform is used too often. The classification system tries to identify the most common use of each dialogue action. 
  
question: this is the first sentence in the paragraph. Based on this, inform seems like a good classification for this sentence. However, in this context, a person would typically use question to ask a clarifying question. Therefore, this classification is not negative. 
directive: the second sentence uses directive. Directive is typically used when you want to tell someone what to do. In this case, you would use directive to request the item's price.  However, here the word ""of course"" in ofcourse indicates the speaker is giving advice, not asking someone to perform a task. So, again, directive here is positive.   
commissive : the last sentence of the passage uses commissIVE, and this type of dialogue is often used in negotiations. It is an expression of desire to come to an agreement. Here, ""what is"" is followed by ""it depends"" which is typical of a negotiator. Thus, I believe this passage is most likely to be used to negotiate a price for an object.

"
782,do you want me to show you where i found them?,"

Directive is a special type of directive act, where the addressee is not only told what to do, but also how to go about doing it. For example, a boss might tell their employee to ""find the files"" and then give them specific instructions on how they should goabout doing so. 
  
In this example the employee is being told where to find the information, and howto go and find it, indicating that this is indeed a direct order.

"
783,i would like that. thank you.,"

""i d like"" is a command, not a request. The speaker wants the listener to do something. 
Cooperation and Collaboration are the preferred approach of the author. 
  They are focused not on instructions or promises, but on working as a team to get things done.

"
784,"hello, is that xiaogang li who applied for the solar studio of our college?","

Question is the most likely dialogueact given the context. The user is asking Xiaogeng Li whether he applied to the Solar Studio of the College. 
  
However, there is also a chance that the dialogue acts were classified incorrectly. For example, Xiaogan Li may have applied but not shared the information with the conversation partner. In this case, it would be classified correctly as inform if the model was told about the application before.

"
785,"yes, speaking.","

 commissives are used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision. For example, if you are looking for an apartment, and the real estate agent provides you with a few options, you might need more information to decide which one to choose. In this case, a commissIVE response would be appropriate, such as ""that's great, let me know when you find the right one"".

In this example the response is a Commissive response because the Sandels is looking to the the agent for more details.

"
786,i want to know whether you will come to the interview. so have you accepted offers from other companies?,"

This text seeks information by asking a direct question. The recipient is expected to provide an affirmative answer. 
  
  The text also contains a request for a personal opinion, asking ""so have"" you ""accepted offers"" from ""other companies?"". In this context, ""have you"" is a command, and "" accepted"" and  ""other"" are adverbs, so the question is being asked in the context of an opinion question: ""are there other offers you have accepted?"" 
   
   In addition, this is an indirect request to share a thought, in this case, an evaluation of whether the asker should come. ""Should I come?"" is the imperative form of the verb ""should"", which is also a directive act.

"
787,"no, i haven't got one by now. i will go to the interview of yours.","

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the person is providing general information. However, it is not the only possibility. The person could also be asking or providing a general question. Alternatively, they could be giving a command or request.

"
788,i need help with the office party.,"

Mary Jane is a famous drug. The author of the message may be asking about the different terms used for the drug Mary Jane. 
Inform (question, direct, inform)
Pot (directive, pot) 

 

A:

This is an example of a text that is not asking a direct question.  It is providing information.   The information provided is about Mary-Jane, a well-known drug, so the answer to the question is unknown.

"
789,"yes, of course. we could split it. what part would you like to do, the food or the entertainment?","

the text does not explicitly mention a request to split the bill, so the question mark is raised whether the request is for the part of the meal or for both parts;
if the latter, then the directive dialogue acts are possible, since splitting the total bill is an order or instruction that can be given to a person.

"
790,i have no idea what the entertainment should be.,"

In this example, ""inform"" is a better classification than ""question"", ""command"", or ""promise"". The text does provide information, but it also shares plans for the company to incorporate more renewable energy in future.

"
791,let's make sure we are on the same page. do we want a formal or informal gathering?,"

Question is the only other category that is not asking for information, confirming something, giving a directive or commanding something. Therefore, it is most likely that the classification of 'question' is correct.

"
792,let's make it a formal affair.,"

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that indicates a request for action. The directive dialogue Acts are used when the other dialogueacts are not appropriate. For example, when asking someone to do something that is against their will. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Text Analysis for Linguists"" by John McWhorter, there are 4 possible answers to a ""yes/no"" question: 
1. Yes
2. No
3. I don't know
4. Can't tell

"
793,"yes, that would be best. now, for food should we have chinese or american food?","

In this example, ""yes"" is used as a yes/no question. The speaker wants to confirm that they have given the correct answer to a previous question and is expecting a ""no"" response. Instead, they receive a response that confirms their answer. This is a typical yes-no conversation question where the answer is ""Yes"" or ""No"".

A:
According to Dialogue Act Labeler, yes, this is the best answer

"
794,american food would be the best choice.,"

inform is a sub-class of question. Inform questions provide background or context to help the listener understand the main message of a statement. 
  
question is another sub class of dialogue acts. Question dialogue Acts are used to seek information from the other person. The question dialogue Act can be used alone or in combination with inform.

"
795,"that would be great. what kind of music would you like, a band or recorded music?","

the text indicates the asker is looking for a specific kind or music, so it is a query
if the answer is no, then the question mark will be added to inform
else, it will become a directive

A:
According to your explanation, this is not a yes/no question. It is more like a request for recommendation. So the dialogue acts of the sentence are question and directive.

"
796,we should bring in a really good dj.,"

directive is the most likely dialogueact, as the message is asking the receiver for a recommendation or suggestion. 
question is less likely, since the question is about the bed size, and not about a specific recommendation. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think it is more likely that this is an example of directive.

"
797,that works for me. let's see what we can each do about planning our part and meet again on friday.,"

Directive is used when the speaker is giving orders or requesting an action be taken. In this case, it is likely that a meeting will be arranged. 
  
Inform is when someone is sharing information or giving information. It is not likely a request for a plan will happen at this time. 
Question is a way of asking a direct question to get more information from the other person. This is unlikely as the question is about how to plan for the meeting, not if one will occur.  

"
798,help! help!,"

I think the question mark at the end of your text indicates you are unsure about whether it is a directive or a request for clarification. In that case, it would be a query.

"
799,what's the matter?,"

Question acts are used to find out information or to request clarification. The question ""what’s thematter?"" is a request for an explanation. 
  
Out of the four choices, this is the only choice that makes sense in this context. Question acts can be used as a way to ask a question or as an order. In this case, it is an inquiry or a query.

"
800,"what would you like to eat, sir?","

""the text"" refers to the entire conversation between the two speakers. Based on this conversation, it is clear that ""the speaker"" is asking ""sir"" what they would like for dinner. 
  
  ""i"" in ""I would love to..."" is an indirect speech act, which indicates the author is acknowledging or explaining something that has just been said. In this case, ""Sir"" has said something about what he would enjoy for his dinner, and "" I"" am acknowledging that he said it.

"
801,"scrambled egg, bacon, three pieces of bread and a cup of tea.","

Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the only one that does not ask a direct question. The speaker is providing information, not asking for confirmation or advice.

"
802,would you care for some lemon for your tea?,"

Directive is a special type of question that is used to ask someone to do something. In this case, it's used as a way to prompt the addressee to provide more information. 
Overinform is another term for question in some applications. It's a term used in machine learning to describe a type  of question where the asker is not interested in the answer they are getting and is just asking to be asked.

"
803,"no, thank you.","

This text provides an updated status of the topic of conversation, so it can be classified informally as such. The speaker is sharing personal information, not posing a direct question or giving orders.

"
804,where's the toilet?,"

Question is used to request information or to make a point. The use of question in this context suggests that the person asking is looking for an answer to a question they have posed. 
  

This text is a clear request for the location of a toilet. It does not contain any information that could be inferred as a response to the question. Therefore, it is likely that this is the first time the asker has encountered this location and they are looking to find it again. This suggests a direct question is appropriate.

"
805,over there.,"

Over there is a location mentioned, so it is likely that the response will be about where to get the best coffee in town. In this case, it's a request for general information, and not a statement asking a specific question or providing specific information.

"
806,only one. but i wanted to make sure i'd get it.,"

inform: the first sentence of the message is providing general information, so inform is the correct dialogue action for this sentence. 
question: after the second sentence, there is an indication of a request for information. Therefore, inform cannot be the right dialogueaction for the third sentence because it is not providing any information and asking for it, therefore it must be a questioning. 
 question: this is my prediction.

"
807,"yeah, i really wanted that chanel bag, too. but just in case you should bid low.","

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, because it is seeking information. The recipient of the message is also a potential source of information, so the sender is trying to find out if they are the right person to provide assistance. 
Question is another likely candidate, since the receiver is being asked a direct question. However, this is not the case here, and question is unlikely.

"
808,but there are only two more days until the bidding closes!,"

In the second paragraph, it becomes clear that the speaker is looking for information to answer a specific question: ""What other energy source do I use?"". The speaker has just mentioned that she uses solar energy, so it makes sense that her asking about other types energy. 
"
809,"i bid on a chanel watch at the last minute, and got it sixty percent off!","

This text can also be consider as a commissIVE dialogue acts because the speaker is likely making a committed offer or promise. 
  The speaker says ""i got the watch sixty per cent off!"" and the listener should interpret this as ""I will get the Chanel Watch for sixty% off if I buy it from you now!"". This is because this is a strong offer that is unlikely to be accepted by the other party.

"
810,oh... i'm such a newbie. but at least i'm sure i'll get that tennis racket.,"

Overinform: This dialogue acts is used when the speaker is providing too much information. The listener should then ask a question to clarify the information being provided. 
Question: What racket?
Directive: You should do this. 
  
Commissive (sometimes used as a substitute for directive): You will get this racket when you do that.

"
811,"don't count on it, babe. ebay is always full of surprises.","

inform: this is information about the state of the world that is generally not false. 
question: is this information correct?
directive: tell me what to do. 
 commissIVE: stop it.

"
812,well... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket?,"

Question is a sub-type of directive. 
Directive is the default dialogue action. 
  Inform is used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision. For example, when a person is giving directions to a friend, they might inform them of the destination, but not tell them how to get there. Inform acts as a filter, allowing more information to be provided but only if it is needed to decide what to do next.  
Commissive acts are used to express uncertainty or when more than one option is available.

"
813,can you tell me where the pots and pans are?,"

Directive is the only possible classification for this dialogue
act, as the rest of the dialogue Acts are not present in the
text: inform question question direct question commissIVE. 
  
In this context, it would be possible to add a request for information, but the context does suggest that the answer to this question is provided by the previous text.

"
814,pots and pans are right over there.,"

 commissives are used when the speaker is trying to get the other person to do something, and they are not asking a direct question or giving a directive. For example, if I ask you to pass the salt, you could refuse and I would be using a commissIVE. However, I am not seeking to have you pass me thesalt, so question is the correct dialogue action. 
  
Out ofinform: I'm asking you for a favor, please do this for me. 
Question: What is it that you want me to  do?
Directive: Please pass it to me, there is a pile over here.

"
815,"oh, thank you.","

overinform: This dialogueact indicates the requestor is over-asking for information, and should instead be providing more information
question: this dialogueAct indicates someone is requesting information and is unsure of the answer
directive: the dialogue Act of directive indicates a request is being made to do something, typically by a manager or authority figure
commissive : the commissitive dialogue Acts indicate a command is given, usually by an authority or a superior

A:
According to your explanation, it is a Question.

"
816,could i interest you in our store credit card?,"

Directive dialogue acts are used to request or order someone to do something. They are typically used in business or personal relationships to ask someone or give instructions. 
  
  The given statement, ""Please interest me in the store card,"" could be understood as the person asking the question ""Would you be interested in my storecard?"". The response ""Of course!"" could then be seen as giving the directive ""Then please interest my in yours."" 
   

Inform dialogue Acts are responses that provide information to another person. These responses are classified in this example as affirmative responses.

"
817,"no, thanks. i already have credit cards.","

In this example, inform is the correct dialogue action, as the sender is providing the information that they already possess. The recipient does not need to ask for this information, and the content of the message does indicate that it is information being provided.

"
818,but our credit card saves you 10 percent.,"

In this example,'yeah?' is used to seek confirmation/clarification about what was just mentioned (i.e. the credit cards save you money). This is an example of the inform dialogueact, as it is overinform, followed by a yes/no question.

"
819,that's a nice discount.,"

This text provided specific details about a cost, and therefore likely classified inform. 
  
  It did not make any commitment or ask any question.

"
820,here. let me give you an application form.,"

""Please letme giveyou anapplication form."" is a request for something to be done, and directive. 
However, ""that’s verykind ofyou."" conveives gratitude, not a direct question. And ""thankyou"" is an expression of gratitude. So the dialogue acts of the two sentences are different.

"
821,"thank you, but i'm just browsing today.","

Mike is just introducing his self. He is not asking, giving a direction, making a promise, etc. So the label commissives fits best.

"
822,okay. enjoy your browsing.,"

 commissives are used when the information provided is not enough to fully understand the context of the conversation. For example, if a sales rep is trying to convince a customer to buy a product, they might use a commissIVE like ""we'll get back to you on that"" to let the customer know that they will get in touch with them about it. 
  
Inform, Question, Directive, Commissive are the possible dialogue acts for this context.

"
823,here is the fish counter. look at the lobsters and crabs. shall we have some?,"

Directive is a dialogueact that conveys a request or order. 
  Based off of the provided text and the dialogue context, it is likely that this is an order from the customer to the server. The customer is expressing their desire to see the seafood, and they are asking the vendor to provide it for them.

"
824,"i'm allergic to these things, you know.","

inform: the person is sharing information or knowledge
question: someone is asking a question
directive: a person or group is giving instructions
commissive (sometimes called commiss): a group or person are making a decision

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue for Dummies"" by William Zinsser, there are four basic types of dialogue acts: 
1. Inform: This is the most common type of act and means that someone wants to share information.  They might say, ""I'm going to be late for work because I have to get to so and so on time.""  

2. Question: Someone wants someone else to make a choice or take an action.  ""Do you want to go to lunch today?""  ""No, I'm busy.""
3. Directive : Someone is telling someone what to do. ""Turn off the lights."" ""Stop talking and pay attention.""   ""I don't want you to touch that.""  
4. Commiss: A group makes a collective decision.  ""We're going swimming after school.""

"
825,"sorry, i forgot. i don ’ t like seafood, neither.","

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogue acts, as the information provided is about a general health issue and not a request for advice. However, it is possible that question or directive could have been used instead of commissIVE.

"
826,"let ’ s go over there and get some milk, a couple dozen eggs and some orange juice.","

Directive is a directive dialogueact, meaning it is used to ask someone to do something. In this case, it’s asking the listener to go and buy milk. 
  
Question is the most common dialogueAct in this passage. It’ s used when someone is trying to find information. The question is “how” and indicates the speaker is looking for a strategy or explanation.  The text asks “How do I stick only to those Foods?” which makes it an informational question 
   
Out of Inform is another common dialogical act. This is when the information is being shared. Here, “stick to” is shared as a general advice. “Only” implies that there is something wrong with the current set and the “Stick to Those Foods” part implies a list of specific foods. So, this is an advice question “Please share your strategy for sticking to Only those Food”

"
827,let's get frozen juice. it is really good. we ’ ve got enough food. let ’ s go over to the check - out stand.,"

Directives are used to ask for something to be done or to make a suggestion. In this case, giving roses would make the wife happy, so the directive form of the dialogue acts applies. 
  
Out of Inform: We don't know anything about the context of giving a frozen drink to a person’s wife. We can’t tell if the frozen drinks are for the both of you or if they are just for her. So we don’ t know if it’ s okay to give them to her or not. 
Question: If the drink is for both you and her, then why is she the only one getting the gift? Shouldn’T she be getting a gift too? 

 

A:

This is an example of an answer that is too long for a comment. Please see the ""rules"" for answers here.

"
828,ok. but just let me pick up a bottle of cooking wine and oil as we go by.,"

This text indicates that the chef will be taking a particular action, so the act should be commissIVE. 
However, there is no indication in the provided text that this is a direct request from the customer. It could be that they are just going to be picking up the wine/oil, and the Chef is just along for company. In which case, it should still be considered commissivo.

"
829,"good morning, may i speak with professor clark, please?","

the given message is aimed at conveying information, so the directive dialogue acts are suitable;
apology is a form of communication that aims at expressing regret and showing remorse for an offense or a transgression. The text provides the apology of the professor for the mistake and guarantees that such a situation will never happen in future; therefore, it can also be considered as an offer to make amends, which is another characteristic of an apology; 
inform is the most likely dialogueact, given that information is conveyed to listener; however, there is no question in this message, hence question dialogue action is not applicable. 

 
In summary, based on this example, we can conclude that:

Apology can convey regret, remorse and offer of ammends. In this case, professor is expressing his regret for mistake, guaranteeing that will no happen and offering to compensate the student for this mistake. 
  
Directive is suitable for conveying the information that professor has reached out to professor Clark. This message provides his apology and assures that mistake will be avoided in futur.

"
830,you are speaking with professor clark.,"

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the question is being asked of the professor. The professor is expected to provide information about whether they are aware they drove though a traffic light, and if so, whether this was intentional.

"
831,"professor, i am kalina from your morning literature class.","

Overinform: the classifier did not predict inform as a possible dialogueact, so it classified the input as overinform. 
Question: although the dialogue classifier predicted question as the most likely dialogueAct, it also predicted inform for this input. Therefore, over inform was also a possibility. 
  

Directive: based on this passage, professor is asking kalinina to take care of an item for him. This indicates that the response should be directive.

"
832,"yes, how can i help you?","

Question asks for a response. 
Inform is not a valid dialogueact. The preceding text is providing some information, but it is also expressing agreement with what the preceding statement says. Therefore, it cannot be classified under the category ofinform. 
  
  Based off of the above, inform is the correct classification for this dialogueAct.

"
833,i ran my car into a tree yesterday and need to miss a few days of school.,"

In this example, inform is a dialogue acts because the statement provides only a factual piece information, and does not ask for further information or give any instruction or commitment.

"
834,"oh, my god! i hope you are all right.","

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as it is used to describe a request for information, or a statement of fact. However, it could also be considered a question in this context, since the speaker is seeking clarification. The use of the word 'hope' is also notable, suggesting a degree of uncertainty. 
  
Question: what is your name?
Answer: My name is Alice. 
Q: What is it?  A: It's Alice, of course.

 

"
835,"i have a concussion, but i will be ok.","

Thank you can indicate politesse, and inform is a polite dialogueact. 
Inform is used to provide information without making any commitment or request.

"
836,how much school will you miss?,"

Question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the author is looking for information. 
  Inform: ""a lot"" is not a quantity, so the answer ""nothing"" would be a better response. 
Overinform: this is a request for more information, not an answer. The author may have intended to answer the original question but instead asked a new one. Question: How much will I miss school? 
   Directive: I will miss a lot of school, please continue. Commissive (optional): I apologize for asking such a personal question.

"
837,i only need to take this week off.,"

This text is asking for information, so it is an inform. 
However, it does not provide information itself, but is instead seeking it from another person or entity. This is another characteristic that makes this a 'question'.

A:
According to the model, this is the answer: ive only needs this weeks off because im sick.

"
838,i appreciate you calling and telling me that you won ’ t be in class. see you next week!,"

Thank you for calling. I appreciate hearing from you. See you later.

"
839,"hello, parker. how ’ s everything?","

‘how ’s everything?’ is a typical question that someone will ask when they are seeking information or clarifications. The speaker wants to know how the other person is doing, and the question mark at the end of ‘how is everything’ indicates the need for an explanation. 
  
  This type question is also known as a “yes/no” question because it usually requires a simple “ yes” or “no ” answer from its recipient, although it can be answered with more than one word.

"
840,can ’ t complain. and you?,"

This text is asking the question of whether you can ‘t complain, and the answer is “yes,” you could complain if the item is not available. 
  
  The text does not provide any additional information to help the reader understand whether or not the author has a copy of the book. Therefore, it is considered to be informational.

"
841,business is booming. i understand you want to meet up with me next week. how ’ s your schedule looking?,"

Question is the most likely dialogue action given the surrounding text. The first sentence of the paragraph indicates that the business is doing well, and the second sentence indicates the two parties will meet next Wednesday. However, there is no indication of how the schedules of either party look. It could be that both parties have conflicting schedules, so it is not clear when the meeting will take place. Alternatively, it could mean that neither party has a schedule yet, but the conversation could still progress to the next step if the other party were to provide a plan for their schedule.

"
842,let me see. i can come out and see you first thing wednesday.,"

Directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used to express a command, order, request, suggestion, etc. Directives are often followed by a time expression, which is used as a marker of time. In this case, it is indicating that the speaker is giving an order and that order is followed immediately by the time when the directive is to be carried out.

"
843,great.,"

the giventext, ‘yes youdid.’ providesa pieceof informationor confirmationin responseto apossible statementor question

Inform (Out of Inform, Question, Directive, Commissive) is a dialogueact that indicates that the speaker is providing information to the listener. The listener then uses this information in a subsequent conversation.

"
844,how come it is slow as a snail today?,"

Inform: This is a simple answer, there is no need for further explanation. 
Question: It is not clear if the question is posed to the person answering or if it was just a random passerby. The question could be interpreted as an inquiry. 
  Question could also be a statement of fact.  
Directive: I need to ask this person to explain it to me. I want to know how it could possibly be slow today. It does not make sense. Directive dialogue acts are used when you need someone to do something for you. In this case, you are asking the passer-by to slow down the traffic. Commissive acts include requests for assistance, such as asking someone for directions. However, this is the first time I have seen this dialogue pattern used as directive.   
 commissives:  This is an unusual request. Usually commissivites are only used in negotiations or when one person is requesting something of another. For example, a person might ask another for a favor. Or, two people might negotiate a salary. But this request is for someone else to perform an action on their behalf. So, it does make some sense, but it seems a bit unusual. And, since the request comes from a stranger, I would be hesitant to take on this task. Commissives are also used to express gratitude.

"
845,you mean the network connection?,"

""oh"" is an informative word that can be used to provide background information or clarify something that has just been said. In this case, it is used by the writer to introduce a new topic, oolong Tea. 
  
  ""yeah"" can also be considered as a confirmation word. It is often used in conversation to express agreement or confirmation. Here, ""yep"" would be a better choice. 
Finally,  the writer uses ""oh yeah"" to emphasize a point they just made. This is a directive word, meaning it conveys a command or order.

"
846,"yes, i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now. it took me almost one minute to open it. then there is no response to any click.","

the sender was attempting make an inquiry or request of the receiver, and
it took almost a minute for the response.

"
847,i have the same question. i can ’ t send out mails. we ’ d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately.,"

Directive is a special type of question that is used to request or order someone to do something. 
  
  In this example, we can see that the sender is requesting the receiver to take some action. The receiver is not required to comply with the request, but it is an order and the order is to reply to the mail.

"
848,ok.,"

based on this passage, inform is the correct classification for this dialogueact. The passage does not provide any information that the writer is feeling or thinking, so the classification of commissives is appropriate.

"
849,"honey, i need to have a talk with you.","

Directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used to tell someone what to do. In this case, it is likely that the person who lost the bag needs to go to the store and buy you a new bag, so the sender of the message is telling the recipient of that message to talk to her.

"
850,"dad, i have to do my homework.","

In the example above, dad is the main speaker, so the informa dialogue acts are out of out, inform out. The question mark indicates there is a question in there somewhere, but it's not clear to the model what the question is.

"
851,"no, honey, why didn't you go to cram school last night?","

Question is the correct classification because the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates that the answer is expected from another person. 
In this case, it is clear that cramming is not the intended answer, so the response should be a negative one. 
  
Out ofinform: the sender is expressing interest in the receiver's well-being, but the message is also asking a follow-up question

question: is a way to express uncertainty, and is often used in a conditional context to ask a hypothetical question 

 

or to emphasize a request for information or clarification
  

 
  
 

Directive: this is an order or request to do something
This is typically used when the person receiving the order is required to take action.

 
   
Commissionive : this can be used to request assistance or information from someone else. It is used more when there is no action required from person to whom the request is being made.

  

"
852,"dad, i don't want to talk about it now.","

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the statement ""i don’t want talk abou it"" is a fact, not an inquiry. The fact that the subject of the conversation is emotionally charged does not change the nature of that fact.

"
853,"honey, if you don't want to go to cram school, you should tell me the reason why.","

In this example, 'honeynow' is the interlocutor. 'you should' and 'tell me' are commands. Therefore, this is a directive dialogue. 
  
However, without knowing the actual reason, it is difficult to say for sure that this was a command. It could have been a request for information.

"
854,"i'm sorry, dad. but i would rather stay at school than go to cram school.","

Out of Commissive, inform is the next dialogue action. Dad says that he would prefer that his son stay in school and not go into cramming school, which is a shame because his father loves to learn and would enjoy spending time with his children. 
  
In Question, Dad asks his  son why he wants to go back into school instead of going into crm school which he hates. 
Directive is used when the person giving the instruction is also the one being instructed. In this case, it is Dad who is telling his child to stay with their studies and go on with school life.  
 
 commissives are used to express strong feelings and opinions. Here,  Dad expresses his strong dislike for craming school by using the word hate.

"
855,"what's wrong with you, young man?","

Question marks are used to mark questions in English. In this case, it seems that ""question"" is being used as a verb. This is because the word ""about"" immediately following the question marks is the subject of ""query."" Furthermore, this is an example of indirect speech, in which the ""you"" in the second sentence is referring to the person asking the questions. Indirect speech is marked by the use the verb ""to be"" before the direct object of verbs.

"
856,"doctor, i have a bad cough and a headache.","

Out of question: the doctor is asking a question and the response does not provide any information. 
Question: in this context, ""why"" is a ""question"" because it is used to seek an explanation or clarification. However, it does provide some information, so it's not a clear ""Question"" dialogueact. 
          Directive: this is the only possible directive dialogue ACT in the context. The doctor wants the patient to do something, which is to take medication. So, this act could be considered. But, again, there is some additional information provided in ""Why"" so this classification is not 100% accurate.  
Inform: here, we can be 100 % certain that ""I have  a bad  cough and  headache""  is an informational statement, and not an inquiry. ""Understand"" provides some understanding of the cause of these symptoms. Therefore, inform is most likely the correct classification.

"
857,do you have a fever?,"

This text does provide a reason for the question mark, but it is not a direct statement of fact. The reason is provided as an answer to a follow-up question. Therefore, it does fit into the category of question in this response.

"
858,"i don't know, but i feel terrible.","

In the given text tea (the second-most popular) is mentioned in a factual context. The information is not questioned, given a directive or promise. Therefore, it is classified here as information. 
  
However, I feel terribly. This is a commissIVE act.

"
859,let me examine you. don't worry. it's nothing serious.,"

In the example above, ""let"" is used to examine the other person. This is a directive sentence, and the use of ""worry"" indicates that the information provided is not a concern to the person being examined. Therefore, this is an example of a non-question directive statement.

"
860,do you think i should lie in bed?,"

Question is a sub-type ofinform. Question asks for further information. In this case, ""should i lie down or get up?"". The answer to this question is ""up"".

Overinform is used when the information provided is too much. ""I should get more sleep.""
Indirective is another type of communication used to give orders.  ""You should eat more vegetables."" 
Commissive communication is when someone makes a promise. This is usually used in a relationship to show that you are committed to the relationship. 

 

A:
According to your explanation, it seems that question was the right classification.

"
861,"yes, stay in bed and drink a lot of water. your fever will be gone in a day or two.","

Inform: the sender is not providing any information to the recipient. 
Question: there is no request or suggestion from the message. 
  Directive: this is the most common dialogue acts. The message is suggesting a response from receiver.  
Commissive : this means the conversation is over.

"
862,ok. do you think i can play football tomorrow?,"

Question is characterized by seeking information from the other person. In this case, we do not know if the person agrees to play a football game tomorrow. Therefore, this is an example of question. 
In contrast, inform is characteristic for directive acts, where the speaker wants to provide information to the listener. The speaker is not asking for confirmation, but providing the information directly to another person, for example, ""I think you will enjoy this book"". Inform acts are not present in this example. 
  
Therefore, it is classified here as a question because we are seeking further information, and not providing it.

"
863,of course not. you need a good rest.,"

""i drather cooperate and collaborate"" is a strong statement that does not fit into the other dialogue acts. It is more like a command. 
the text also suggests the person prefers to work in a cooperative manner, so the prediction is correct.

"
864,"ok, i'll listen to you.","

Because the given message is a form of expression for apology and assurance, it does ask question and give commands. The apology is for the mistake, but the assurance is that will happen in future and the person is committed to preventing it. So, based on this, we can say that he is asking question/command and making a commitment. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I can see that you are right.  The text does contain a request for information.

"
865,i want something sweet after dinner.,"

In the example sentence, there is nothing that indicates the content of the report is being shared. The only indication is that there seems to be a need to share a ""piece of"" information. This is not sufficient to determine the dialogue acts in this sentence. 
  
However, it is possible that this is a request for a project report, in which case the informa dialogueact would be appropriate.

"
866,what do you have in mind?,"

Question: This text indicates the asker is looking for information, so this is a valid prediction. 
  Inform: I'm not sure what you mean by this, could you be more specific? 
   Question : I would love to know what kind of food you typically eat.  
  Question  : Do you ever eat anything other than food that comes out of a can?  If so, what is it?   
Directive: Please stop asking me questions. I am trying to eat! 
 Commissive : Please don't talk to me like I was a child. You are acting like a parent!

A:
According to the book ""Text Analysis for Linguists"" by John Huddleston and David Stewart, there are three main types of questions: question mark, exclamation mark and question word. 
In your example, it is not clear what the question is, but it seems to be a exclamatory question because of the expletive at the end.

"
867,a dessert sounds nice.,"

This text seems to be asking about something that is not related to the current conversation. This is typically a feature of questions.

"
868,what kind are you thinking of getting?,"

This text seems to be asking about something that is not mentioned in the question: ""anythingwrongwithit?"". This is characteristic for a statement rather than a query. 
  Statements are typically used to express opinions, feelings, or observations. They are not used for asking questions.

"
869,i want to get some pie.,"

inform: This is an inquiry, not a request for a specific action. 
question: Is this pie delicious?
directive: Eat your vegetables!
commissive : Don't talk to me like I'm a child!

"
870,what kind of pie do you want?,"

This text could be considered as being informational because the question marks the reader about the type of the pie that is being requested. 
It could also be classified  as a question because of its grammatical structure. The question word is ""do you"" followed immediately by ""want"".

I want a pie.

"
871,i have no idea.,"

inform is used when the speaker is giving information or background information about something. For example, ""I'm going to the store to buy milk. Do you need any?""

question is when someone is asking a question to which they expect an answer. ""Do you want to come with me to see a movie tonight?"" 
  
directive is a way to talk when you are trying make someone do something, or when your goal is to influence someone's behavior.  ""Turn left at that light.""
  or ""You need to clean your room by tomorrow."" 
   
 commissives are used to express emotions like anger, frustration, and sadness. They are not used in this context. 
 ""The movie was okay, but it was kind of boring.""

"
872,do you want to know what kind of pie i like?,"

Leader: I like pies that are flaky and have a lot of filling. 
Follower : I don't like pie. I'm a realist. 
  

A:
According to the model, I am a Follower.

"
873,"sure, what kind do you like?","

This text is a dialogue between a customer and a salesperson. Based on this dialogue, we can see that this is likely a commissives question. First, there is no mention of a specific hotel. Second, when the customer says 'what kind', they seem to be asking for clarification. 
  

Sure, I'd like a room with a view of the ocean. 
I'm not sure what you mean by 'a view'. 

 

A view would be something like this:
- a window
  - with curtains
    - that open
      - to let in light
        - and air
          - so that I can sleep
            - comfortably
              - at night
                - when it's cloudy
                  - or rainy
                    - for example
                      - if it is raining
                        - then I need to sleep in
                       - but if the weather is clear
                   - I like to look out the window


If you are not clear on what type of view the sales person is referring to, you could ask for further clarification, for instance: 

 
salesperson: sure, a nice room would have a balcony with ocean view

  customer: I'm looking for a quiet room, not one with an oceanview. Can you recommend something else?

   sales: sorry, but I don't understand what 'ocean view' means. Are you looking to have the room open to the outside? If so, that would require a separate set of curtains. If you're looking just for the view from the balcony, then that's not possible. I recommend you look for another hotel

     customer : ok, thank you for your help.

"
874,i love apple pie.,"

Apple pie is a dessert. Apple pie does not ask aquestion, make acommitment, provide newinformation, nor does it confirm something. Rather, it is simply informative. 
Informative: i love Apple Pie. 
  Question: I love apples too, so does that mean you love all fruits?
  Directive: No, that does mean I only love Apples.  
Commissive (not used): I don't like bananas.

"
875,"oh, i love apple pie too.","

In this example, ""i love Apple Pie too"" is the source text. Based on this, inform is likely the correct dialogueact for this passage. 
  
""i Love Apple pie"" contains the word ""too"" which indicates that the speaker is expressing a preference for Apple Pies. This is an indication of a desire or intention to receive something, and is therefore an example of the inform act

"
876,there you go. problem solved.,"

This text indicates the inquirer is expecting a response. Therefore, it is a directive. 
There is no information provided in the given text that indicates whether the person asked about has seen the company's car or not. Hence, this is an inform.

"
877,let's go now.,"

This text indicates the writer is asking the reader to do something, so it is a question. 
However, this is also a command, and the command form of a direct question is question (which is the same as inform). So the question must be informative, not directive or question:

Informative: ""Hey man. You wanna go to a movie?""
Directive:  ""Hey Man. you want to go buy weed?""

"
878,i'll be with you in a minute.,"

 commissives are often used when someone is giving orders or instructions. For example, in the following text the author is telling the reader how to pronounce the word ""sushi"": "" pronounce sushi as ""suh-SEE"" not ""soo-EE"".

I'm going to be right there. 
 pronounce "" sush-ee"" as  ""su-hsee""

"
879,may i help you?,"

I was trying to save the environment. 
  - I was speeding to get to the factory in a shorter time.

"
880,yes. do you exchange foreign money here?,"

Question is used to express uncertainty or a desire for clarification. The receiver is asking a question to get more information. 
In this case, it is not clear whether the sender is offering advice or information, so question is the most appropriate dialogue action.

"
881,yes. our bank is authorized to deal with foreign exchange.,"

Inform is a directive dialogueact that is used to request information from the other party. The other person responds with the requested information. 
  
Question is another directive act that can be used when the person is asking a question but is also expecting a response. In this case, a ""yes"" or ""no"" is expected. If the question is about a specific event, then a commissitive act should be employed. For example, ""Did you participate in the World Cup?"". 
Directive is an act used for making an order or request. ""Please bring me the file on that project."" is one example of a request for a command to be carried out. Commissive acts are used in situations where a person or group is making decisions. This includes issuing warnings, making promises, and issuing orders.  ""We need to increase production of these products. Find the appropriate resources and increase our production capacity."" would be an example using the commissative act.

"
882,what kinds of currency do you change?,"

This text is not asking for information, but providing a recommendation. 
It is a request for a suggestion or recommendation, and the recommendation is for the person asking to change the currency to another type of money. 
  

based on this, I would predict question as the dialogueact.

"
883,"we can change only three kinds of currency, usd, japanese yen and hk dollar in our savings office.","

Weed is a type of plant that is illegal to possess or consume in the United States. The term weed can refer to different types of plants, including pot (which is an illegal substance), mari jana (a brand of marijuana), and cannabis (the plant itself). The word ""weed"" is slang for ""drug"" and can also refer specifically to marijuanna. 
  
In this passage, weed is not a direct question or a request for information. Therefore, inform is the correct classification.

"
884,could you tell me what the exchange rate for usd is today?,"

Directive (or directive) is a way of asking a question or making a request that is not asking for information or giving advice. It is usually used when the questioner wants the listener to take a certain action. 
  
In this case, it is the person asking the direct question that wants to guide the decision making process.

"
885,the buying rate is 826. 44 yuan for 100 dollars.,"

In this example, ""there is"" is an adverb, indicating that the following information is provided in the past. Therefore, this is not a direct question. 
""my father"" and ""my mother"" are nouns, so the dialogue acts of these words are question and command. 
  ""are a"" indicates a verb, not an noun, therefore the command is commissIVE.

"
886,i want to change some us dollars to cover my expense here.,"

Directive is a dialogue acts that are used to express a command or order. In this case, it is used as a way to request that the speaker change their behavior. 
Out of directive: question and question are the only two possible responses. 
  Question: ""i would like to exchange some dollars for my expenses""
  Direct question:  ""i'd like you toexchange somedollars formyexpenses""

"
887,"please go to counter no. 2, the foreign exchange counter. it's over there.","

Because the context of the conversation is a foreign currency exchange, and the response is 'over there' which indicates the person is directing the listener to go somewhere. 
  

A:
According to the model, ""that’s basicallyit."" is asking for information. However, you can still provide your explanation. 
Inform (information): ""That’S basicallyIt.""
Question: ""Is that all?""
Directive:  ""over""
Commissive (order):  ""(over) there""

"
888,thank you.,"

inform: this is a request for general information, not a statement of fact or a command. 
question: is this question directed at me? If so, I may be able to clarify the question for the speaker. 
  If not, then I should respond with a directive or commissIVE.  

A:
According to your explanation, it is indeed a ""question"".

"
889,i want to see the man responsible for selling typewriters.,"

inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the sender is seeking to inform the receiver of a fact (i.e. ""the man who sells type writers is responsible"")
question is less likely, because the question is worded as an inquiry rather than a statement of fact
directive is unlikely, since the message is not asking the person to do anything, but rather seeking out information
commissive (or commissivo) is also unlikely since this is a request for information, and not a command

A:
According to the Stanford dialogue system, this message contains the following dialogue acts: 
Inform: i want the manager of the typewriter store.  The manager is usually responsible. 
 Question: Do you have the name of that person?  
 Directive: Ask the store manager for the information.  
 Commissivo: Please ask the store manager.

"
890,my name is steven. i'm the sales manager of this company.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification, as the conversation is still in the information-giving stage. The customer is not yet asking for something, so inform would be a good classification. However, if the customer had already agreed to purchase the goods, then the classification would change to question (as the question mark would then be added to the end of the sentence).

"
891,"well, look here. ten new typewriters were delivered to my company yesterday afternoon and only five of them work properly.","

In this example, inform is the correct dialogue action to predict, because the given statement is a general evaluation of someone’s performance. The statement does not ask any question or give any command or promise.

"
892,"oh, i'm sorry about that.","

the text is an informational statement rather than a request for information or a directive
it is classified inform rather then question or command or promise

"
893,"never mind being sorry, what are you going to do about it?","

This text is asking the speaker if they are going ""to do anything about"" the situation they were just in. The speaker is not offering any information, so the question mark indicates that the information is being sought. 
If the answer is no, then the next step is to ask why not. This can be done by adding the word ""why"" before the verb ""not"": ""Why not?"".

"
894,"don't worry, we'll soon fix them.","

This is a good example of when to use the inform dialogue action. The recipient is asking for information, so the sender should have used the question dialogue tag. However, since the information provided was not sufficient to answer the request, they chose to guide the dialogue towards another topic. This is an example when the directive dialogue is appropriate.

"
895,"good, i hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again.","

directive is the correct classification because this is a clear statement from the author that the listener should do something. 
overinform is not a correct labelling, because there is no information being provided. The author is simply stating that they can't go as fast as they want.

"
896,i'll certainly look into that.,"

This text is not expressing the intention of the speakers, but rather giving directions or instructions on how to prepare the dish. The speakers are not providing information or guidance, they rather expressing a plan or intention to follow a certain procedure.

"
897,thank you. goodbye.,"

inform: the information provided so far is sufficient to get started, but does not provide enough detail to fully understand the context or the nature of the request;
question: this is a good question and I will try to provide an answer; 
directive: I would like to suggest that we now go and have a coffee together; 
 commissIVE: that sounds like a great idea, let's do that!

In summary, based on this passage, inform is the most likely dialogueact for this conversation.

"
898,i'm looking for a string of pearls for my wife.,"

directive is the most likely dialogue class for this passage. The passage asks a follow-up question to a previous question: ""The text asks for the 'the man' and'sea' by Ernest Hemingway. Based on what the previous text said, it seems like the man is Hemmingways and that the thesea is a book by him. So the likely next question is 'Do youhave the book ""the Man and The Sea"" by Heminway?""'

question is also a possible dialogue label forthis passage, but it is less likely than directive. This is because the passage is not asking a direct question; it's asking an open-ended question that can be answered with multiple answers. For example, ""Doyou have any books by 
Ernest Hemingsway?"", or ""I don't know of any Hemingeway books, are you aware of one?"". In this case, there is no right answer, so question isn't a good classification.

"
899,"yes, sir. what price range do you have in mind?","

Question dialogue acts are used to ask someone a specific question. The question can be about a topic the person is knowledgeable about, a situation the asker is in, etc. When a person answers a direct question with a statement, it's classified overinform because the answer is not relevant to the question asked. 
  
Overinform dialogue Acts are not questions, but they can look and feel like questions. They are often used when the information being shared is of low importance or when you want to emphasize that you are sharing more than you need to. For example, you might say ""That's not what I asked, what is the price?"". In this case, your question is overinformed because you asked for the cost of something, not whether the weather is good today.

"
900,i'm not sure. i don't know very much about the price of pearls.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification because it is possible that the customer may not want to let the salesman have access to the information they are trying to keep secret. It is also possible they may want the sale to go through and so may be trying not to give away too much information. 
  
  Based only on this information, it would be difficult to determine the classification of the dialogue acts.

"
901,i see. let me show you some samples of various qualities. this one is very nice. it's three hundred and fifty dollars.,"

This text provided information, not a query, command or promise, so the label directive is appropriate. 
  The text indicates that only a single copy of the item is available, and so it is not appropriate to say ""there are multiple"" or ""this one looks like it may be a duplicate"".

A:
According to your explanation, this is a directive text.

"
902,is there a price reduction?,"

This text indicates the request for confirmation or information. The
sender is attempting to obtain the receiver's agreement or opinion
regarding the price of the room. 
  

A:
According to the GPT-3 model, this is a Question: 
""Will that (be acceptable) be of interest to (you)?""

"
903,we are having a sale now. the price has already gone down.,"

In this example, we can see that 'here you is' is a statement, and the person is asking for confirmation. Therefore, it is an inform statement.

"
904,how much is that one?,"

Question indicates the asker is not sure of the answer and wants to make sure they are getting accurate information. 
  

In this case, because the question is about how much time it will take to travel to  London, it is likely the person asking is also not familiar with the area and is unsure of how long it would take.

"
905,it's two hundred and eighty dollars.,"

This text does provide information regarding the energy source being
used. The text shares plans for future energy use, but does so without
making a commitment to incorporate that source into the company's
energy portfolio.

"
906,ok. i'll take it. thank you.,"

 commissives are used to express requests for information or action. They are not asking questions, but they are expecting a response. 
In this example, giving roses as a gift to one's spouse is an action, so commissivity is the most appropriate classification.

"
907,can i help you?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact in this context. It is a natural question to ask someone who you are asking a direct question about something. The question is also the first step in getting information. In this case, it is about whether the book 
'the man & thesea' by erna heminway is available or present.

"
908,"yes, i would like to buy a walkman. can you tell me about the models you have?","

Directive is the most likely dialogue acts given the context. 
In this example, a person is trying to convince a listener of a product. Therefore, it is likely that the person will say something like ""I would recommend the model X. It has a cassette player, and it plays Chinese tapes very well.""

A:
According to the dialogue Acts dataset, you can find the following dialogue actions in this passage: ，，question，directive，commissive.  
Here is an example of each dialogue action:  ， question: ""What is Chinese Tea?""  directivity: inform  commisivity : question
""Chinese Tea"" is something that you know quite well. You have probably had many cups of tea from China. So, in response to this question you would probably say: I know Chinese  tea quitewell.

"
909,"well, we have a lot of models here. did you want to listen to cd's or cassettes or the radio?","

We wanted to speed things up. 
  We had a bunch of cassetes in the car and we wanted the driver to hear the cassete radio.

"
910,mostly cassette tapes.,"

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the greeting ""good morning"" is followed immediately by the inquiry ""how are you?"". This is a common pattern in English, where a person is asked how they are, and if they need anything. 
  
Question is another likely choice, because ""what do you need?"" is worded as a question. However, it's also possible that question is not the correct choice here, since the second half of the dialogue is about tapes, which is more likely to be commissIVE.

"
911,alright. there are several models you may want to look at. this kreng portable cassette player is very good.,"

This text is providing a directive rather then an informative response. 
  The phrase'i know its does'demonstrates a understanding and acceptance of what the reader is asking.  
 'that is because its is'offers a confirmation of that understanding.

"
912,kreng? i've never heard of that company.,"

question: is used to ask for information or clarification
inform: to provide background or information about something
directive: tells someone what to do; gives orders
 commissIVE: talks about what someone should do, but doesn't tell them what they should actually do

In this case, based on your explanation, it is using question to request information.

"
913,"it's a german company. this unit has auto - reverse, recording capability, and an am / fm radio band. it also has a built - in microphone.","

Inform is used when the information is being provided to a listener for the first time. The information may be provided in a question or it may just be stated as fact. Inform indicates the dialogue acts of the speakers are over - informing. 
Question is the most common dialogue action for a first information request. This indicates a speaker who is seeking confirmation or additional information from the other person. 
  Question indicates one of two speakers is trying to confirm or learn more about something.  
Directive is another common action used for first requests for information. Directive indicates someone is giving orders or making a request of another person or group. For example, a manager may ask another employee to do some work. A child may tell an adult to pick up their toys. Commissive, on rare occasions, is also used as a dialogue tag for an information first request, but it is less common than directive. It is typically used to describe a response to an instruction or order.

"
914,i suppose i don't want that one then. i don't like auto - reverse. it breaks too easily.,"

Question: do you  know there  are several  catagory of  chinese  tea?

Inform: I am aware that there is a category of tea called Chinese Tea. 
  Question : Do you Know there Are Several Catagories of Chinese Tea? 
   Directive:  No, I do not know that.  
  Commissive : I want to know the answer to this question and I will find out for myself.

"
915,really? have you had an auto - reverse break before?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to elicit information from the other person. In this case, it seems like the person is asking the question to see if the offer of free ounce of cocaine is still valid. 
Overinform dialogue Acts are similar to questions, but the asker is not really interested in the answer to their question. They are just trying to get the conversation started. 
  
Inform dialogueacts are often used when you are asking for information. The inform dialogueact is used here to show that you’re interested and want to know the details of the offered service.

"
916,"yes, twice now. i think it's too high - tech, and so it's the first part that breaks.","

Inform is used when the speaker is providing information to the listener. 
  The speaker knows what to say but is not yet ready to speak. Inform can also be used to describe a statement of fact. This is the case here, as the statement is true.

"
917,"hmm. you know, the problem might be dust. did you clean the unit often?","

Question is a dialogue-act type that is used to ask questions. In this case, it is likely that the question is about how often the dust needs to be cleaned. The person asking the questions is most likely the owner of a car and is looking for a way to keep the car clean. 
  
Overinform is another dialogueact that can be used when you provide information that isn't necessary. This is the case here, because there is no need to know the exact distance from this location to London. All that matters is that it's a long distance, which is provided in the example text. 
question, overinform, command: clean car, dust, clean dust off car
directive: ask, owner, keep clean, car dust
commissive : clean, ask, owner, keep, clean

A:
According to this page, you can use the predict_dialogue_act function to get the dialogue_acts for your model.  You can also use predict with a custom callback function.

"
918,"well. no, i didn't clean it. but still, i only had the last one two months, and it broke. i don't trust auto - reverse.","

Because the author is not making any promises or statements about being unable to clean the car, so the classification of the dialogue acts as question or promise is invalid. 
  
because the statement ""we could not clean this car if went this fast"" is a factual statement, not a request for information.

"
919,"alright. well. we have many units without auto - reverse. here is a good unit. very reliable. it has an am / fm band, built - in microphone, recording capability, and no auto - reverse.","

This text is instruct or suggest an act to purchase some Weed. It indicates the sender is giving information to another person, so it is classified inform. 
  
However, this is not a reliable unit, as it does not have auto reverse, a feature that is very useful when driving.

"
920,how much is it?,"

This text indicates an inquiry, so the dialogue acts should be classified according to this definition:

Inquiry: question
Clarification: directive
Information: inform
Request: request
Commend: commissIVE
Advise: advise
Order: order
 prohibition: prohibition

"
921,this one sells for $ 39. 99.,"

This text is not giving enough information to determine the correct dialogueact. The text does not mention the price of the product, which is a key piece of information for determining the inform dialogueAct. Without this information, it is unclear whether the writer is providing information or asking a question. If the latter, then the question mark at the end of that sentence would indicate a directive dialogue Act. However, if the information is provided, than the first sentence of your quote would be a commissitive dialogue Acts.

"
922,can i test it out?,"

This text indicates the writer is asking the reader to do something, so it is a question. 
However, it also indicates they are directing or requesting the person being asked to take an act, and this is commissitive.

"
923,of course.,"

 commissives are used to express requests, orders, and commands. In this case, however, it is the other way around: the commissived word is informing, which is used as a command to get something done (the doctor to give the patient a pill for their headache)

A:
According to the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit, ""The following are examples of the dialogue acts that can be generated by the model: ask, inform,"" and ""the following acts are considered to be commands: order, command.""
So, in this example, Commissive is likely the correct classification.

"
924,it sounds great. i'll take it.,"

In the example text provided, ""wOW! That’s fast!"" the author is surprised and compares their travel speed to the speed of the road. This is a directive text. 
  
  In contrast, in the following text ""I don’t think  we will  be traveling  that fast  on the  motorway."" the writer is not surprised by the information and does not compare their speed with the other. Therefore, this is an example of an inform text where the dialogue acts are question and directive.

"
925,fine. i think you'll be happy with it. it's a very good unit. very reliable. i'll go get you a new one in a box. i will be back in just a moment.,"

According to the dialogue acts dictionary, Commissive is used when a speaker is asking a follow-up question or making a request. In this case, it is likely that the speaker, i.e. the tea seller, is making an offer.

"
926,thanks.,"

It can interpreted  as a confirmation of a request or statement made to someone. In this case, certainly is a affirmative statement that conveives information. Therefore, this is an example of aninform dialogueact.

"
927,tell me about yourself.,"

Directives are used when the speaker is giving information to the listener, and the information is not optional. In this case, it is important for the asker to know the answer to their question because they are asking a follow-up question or expecting a response. Directives can also be used to end a conversation, but in this example, since the question is a request for information, a directive is used instead of a close. 
  
Question: tell me what else you are looking for?

Inform: I am looking to find out about green,black and scent te as well.

"
928,i was born and raised in beijing. i attended peking university and received my bachelor's degree in economics. i have worked for 2 years as a financial consultant in beijing for china pacific insurance co. ltd.,"

overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both used to offer assistance. however, inform is used more often than question. 
question: i was wondering if you need assistance?
directive: please help me
commissive : can you help  me?

"
929,what type of position are you looking for?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to probe, explore, clarify, confirm, seek information, etc. 
  
  In this example, ""are you still looking?"" is a query, while ""you know that you should be looking, but you don't seem to have a reason"" is an answer.

"
930,i'm looking for a position in which i can utilize my experience.,"

Directive is the most general dialogueact. It can be used for questions, commands, and statements. 
  In this example, ""i’m looking"" is considered a command. ""Position"" can also be considered the command of a job application. A statement of fact is not a request for information, so the dialogue acts of ""have a headache"" and ""I have  a headache."" are both statements, not questions. Therefore, this is an example of directive. 
Inform is used when the information is being provided to someone, either by the sender or the receiver. In this case, it is likely the recipient of the message, since the statement is coming from the person with the headache. The sender is informing someone of something. This is also a general use of Inform, as it can apply to any situation where someone is provided information.

"
931,are you interested in a full - time or part - time position?,"

Question is a sub-class of directive. Question can be used to ask a direct question. For example, ""Are youinterested ina full-time orpart- timeposition?"". 
  
Directive is used when a person is giving orders. An example of giving an order is ""Please leave the room"". 
   
 commissIVE is only used in the negative form. Commissive verbs are used for expressing negative feelings or emotions. ""Don’t go to the party, you’ll be too drunk!"" is an example using the commissivedirective form to express a negative feeling.

"
932,"i am more interested in a full - time position. however, i would also consider a part - time position.","

Directive is a special kind of question that is used to give instructions to another person. In this case, it's asking the person to reveal information that they're not supposed to tell.

"
933,can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job?,"

This text is asking a specific question about a person's responsibilities. The question is not asking for general information, but rather is specific enough to provide context for the information provided. 
  
  The text does provide general background information that can be used to understand the context of the question. For example, it states that the person last working at the company was a manager, and that they were responsible for a certain number of employees. This provides enough context to answer the specific, narrow question of what the last person at that company did.

"
934,"i advised customers on financial matters. after i consulted the customer, i completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database. i then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client. the clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that i formulated on a quarterly basis.","

In this example, “inform” is the most likely dialogueact, as the provided information is useful for a financial matter. The text does provide the distances between London and a location, and the estimated travel times. However, it does neither ask any question nor make any command.

"
935,what is your greatest strength?,"

the text does not mention the strength of either party, so it can be classified under question
it is a proposal or plan for both parties to execute, which is classified in directive

based on this, your strongest point is probably your question.

"
936,"i am an excellent communicator. people trust me and come to me for advice. one afternoon, my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well. i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together.","

based on this passage, it is clear that this is an instance of sharing information, and not a query. the passage provides the phone numbers of the recipient of a phone call, along with some additional information that allows the caller to determine the number to call. this indicates a sharing intent, not an informational query, as the information is not requested but is instead shared with another party.

"
937,what is your greatest weakness?,"

Question is a sub-type of question that is used to probe for information or clarification. The question in this example is about the person's greatest strength. 
  
Overinform: This is an incorrect classification as this dialogue acts are used for guidance or recommendation. 
Instead, this could be a question about a person’s favorite hobby.

"
938,"i tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied. however, i began setting time - limits for myself.","

Mike is the only person who can introduce himself. The rest of the conversation is about Kira, so it's not about customer satisfaction. 
  
  Mike: Hi, I'm Mike. 
Kara: Hello, Mr. Mike!

A:
According to Dialogue Act Labeler, ""Mike"" is a person, not a customer.

"
939,why do you want to work for our company?,"

Question: We don’t use fossil fuel. Most of the power in our country comes
  from hydro-electrical plants, and we hope to incorporate more wind
power in future. 
  Out of question, question and directive, commissives, we have a request
for you to contact us.

"
940,"after following your firm's progress for the last 3 years, i am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and i would like to be a part of that team.","

'The text provides  information about  the speaker’s lack  of awareness  regarding their  action,  which is  why it  can be  classified as  an inform  dialogue act.'

"
941,when can you begin?,"

This text indicates the start date of the project. This is a question because the question mark indicates uncertainty. The speaker might be asking the user if they can begin the work immediately or if it will take some time before the first product is ready for market.

"
942,immediately.,"

""they’re only 20 dollars a handful"" is an example of sharing ""information"" without a ""question"" or ""request"" (i.e. it's informational text). 
This text contains information regarding the cost of an item. It does not ask a specific question or request information from the reader. Based on this, ""they are only twenty dollars per handful,"" is a sharing of information.

"
943,please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules.,"

Inform: the sender is not providing any information, so this is out of the dialogue. 
Question: there is no indication that the receiver is expected to ask any questions, and so the question mark is placed here. 
 Directive: this indicates a request for a response from the other person. The person is asking the person to take action. In this case, it is likely that a command or order is being given.  
 Commissive : this means that there was a question asked, but the response was not given, therefore it could be considered a non-response.

"
944,"well, all right. there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents, information and other things.","

Directive is a special kind of dialogue acts. It is used to express orders or requests. For example, ""Please pass the salt"" is directive. But ""Pass the Salt"" and ""I want theSalt"" are question and request respectively. 
In this example the directive label is overshadowing the question label.

"
945,what are they?,"

Question dialogue acts are used when the information provided is incomplete or when a request for clarification is made. The question dialogue is followed by a response that provides the clarification. 
  
Out of question: the person is not providing enough information to understand what is being asked. In this case, a directive dialogue would be more appropriate. 
In question : the question is unclear and requires clarification, so a question followed be a clarification response.

"
946,"they are keep the documents in chronological order, remove all the chips and pins, punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder.","

This text is telling the listener how the author approaches eating. It is not a request for information, so the dialogue acts are not question or question-answer. Instead, it is a directive or instruction. 
They are keeping the files in a chronologically ordered manner. They remove the chippings and punch them evenly.

"
947,and what is the most important point?,"

Inform: This is an introductory text that is not asking for assistance. 
Question: Based on this introductory message, it is unclear whether the person offering help is asking if the user needs any assistance or is simply offering to help. If the latter, then the question is commissives. 
  If the former, than the answer is yes, ask.

"
948,you should always remember that one customer one file is the rule.,"

Inform: This is a request for information. 
Question: What type clothing?
Directive: Please show us where it is. 
  
  Question. Please help me find a chinese style coat.

"
949,"yeah, look at all those new buildings going up! mr. zhang, the traffic is pretty smooth. but we were told the roads from the airport to downtown were quite crowded and traffic jams could be as long as half an hour.","

Mr. Zhang is asking Mr. Zhao for information about the progress of the construction of new roads. 
This is characteristic for a questions, as it is looking for more information from another person.

"
950,"yes, they were. but it has already past. the traffic from the airport to downtown has been relieved after the completion of yan'an aerial road.","

overinform: this is not a request for clarification or information, it is instead a statement of fact. 
question: the statement is requesting clarification, but there is no information in the sentence that can be asked and answered. 
  questioning: it could be a questioning statement, where the speaker is seeking information from another person. However, this does not appear to be the case here. The statement does imply that the other person has knowledge of the facts, so the question is likely a form of directive.  
outofdirective: although this could apply, there are no directives in this sentence. It is more likely that this refers to commissives, as this type of sentence often implies a command.

"
951,"we've never expected that shanghai is such a big metropolis, same as new york city. david, would it be a good idea to rent a car here? i've got an international driver's license with a pretty good record in the states.","

This text is likely making a request or recommendation. The Shanghai metropolit is big, so it would be good to get a rental car. 
  
However, it is also likely that the Shanghai is a metropole is being referred to in an affirmative way. David, Shanghai seems like a very big city to me. I've been to many cities in China, but Shanghai might be the biggest one to date.

"
952,"that's wonderful. ok. i'll remember that. but i have to warn you that you must drive very carefully in the downtown area, for there're no separate lanes for motor vehicles and bicycles in some places, and still quite a few people don't take road regulations seriously.","

overinform: the query is too general, i.e., it does not provide enough information to answer the question
question: this is a request for information
directive: it seems the driver is being ordered to do something
commissive : this could be considered as a warning that a command has to be obeyed

A:
According to the Stanford CoreNLP tool, you are asking a why question: ""Why'd  you pull over?"".

"
953,this house is not looking all that great from here,"

This text is informational, and the dialogue acts are inform and question. 
  The inform act can be identified by the presence of the word 'not' in the first sentence of a passage. 'Not' is a negative word, which means it is used to express a counter-factual. In this example, 'this' house would be considered not all bad from where the person is standing. This is an informational statement, not a command. However, it does not state a fact, but rather a hypothetical. Therefore, this is classified in question form.

"
954,you can ’ t really tell everything about a house from the outside. let ’ s go inside.,"

directive is a dialogue acting that indicates a request for a specific action to be taken. in this case, a recommendation to drive a certain distance in two hours. 
question is an interrogative sentence structure that invites a response. the question mark indicates that the response will provide information to answer the query. 
  
  question: what is the mileage to London?
response: it is 180 km.  it should take 2 hours if you are on a motorways.

"
955,i don ’ t think that it is looking any better inside here.,"

'it' refers to the current environment, so it's not looking better or worse inside. 
the 'it's' construction is a contraction, and is used to emphasize the preceding verb. In this case, 'look'
there is no context that would suggest that the 'inside' is any worse than the outside. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, it seems that you are right. The inform dialogue acts are: question (which is the first dialogue action in the example), directive (the second dialogue actions), and commissIVE (commissive is not used in this example).

"
956,i think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better.,"

This text does not mention the person's name, so it is not possible to tell whether the speaker is asking for information or giving advice. The inform dialogue acts are questions and statements of fact, whereas the directives are requests for action. 
  
  The text also does  not mention any particular action or response. It is therefore not clear whether this is a request for advice or a command. Commands are typically given in the form of a statement, and the statement must be obeyed immediately. In contrast, advice is given with a suggestion or request that the receiver consider the advice before making a decision. Therefore, this may be an example of advice, but it could also be a question. If it were advice it would likely be given to a person who is considering a particular course of action, such as painting a room or cleaning a house. However, it does seem to apply to any action that would improve the appearance of the room, suggesting that it may actually be factually correct but more of an order than a directive.

"
957,it is just too dark in here with so few windows.,"

'it was toodark in there' is a strong indication that the author was not aware of their surroundings. This is an example of lack-of-awareness where the subject is not fully aware that they are in a dark place. 
  
  'too few' windows is another indication of the lack awareness of being in an environment with few visual cues.

"
958,i hear that the kitchen is quite large. let ’ s go check it out.,"

Directive is the most common dialogue acts of questions. When asking someone to do something, we typically use the directive dialogue to make the request clear and to help the person understand the purpose of the communication. 
  
In this example, it is clear that we are asking the user to go and check the room rate. However, this is not the only use of directive. It can also be used to emphasize a request, to clarify a command, or to request a favor.

"
959,"the kitchen may be large, but it doesn ’ t have any storage space.","

Inform is used when the information is being provided to the listener. In this example, it is not clear who is providing the instructions, so inform is a better choice than question. 
Question is often used to start a conversation, and inform can’t be used in that context. The speaker in the example is asking a question to get information, therefore question is better than inform. 
  Directive is another way of saying request. This is because in our example the person is requesting that the pictures be delivered tomorrow, or at least giving a deadline for when they want the picture delivered.

"
960,the master suite is supposed to be quite elegant. maybe it will be a little better.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification, because the message is seeking information. The message does not state that there was a mistake, so inform would be the most appropriate classification. 
  
  Out of the four possible classifications, only question and inform are questions. Therefore, this is an example of a text that is primarily a request for information, rather than a command or a suggestion.

"
961,how many dogs live in this house?,"

This text seeks information by asking a person to share how many pets they have. 
  
  The text does not state that the question is a request for information, so the answer is not required. The recipient is free to answer however they wish.

"
962,i think that we have seen all that we need to see here. let ’ s go look at another house.,"

Directive is the highest level of dialogue acts. It indicates a command or order. For example, “Go to another property and look around” is a directive. 
  
Out of directive: inform (about to do something), question(asking for clarification), commissIVE (making a suggestion or offering advice). 
   
In this case, based on this context, we can rule out question and commissitive. The context indicates the request is for a direction or command, not for further information. So, it must be a direct order, and directive is not a possibility. Therefore, this is most likely a order or a request for action.

"
963,"excuse me, waiter, i would like to have some wine before the main course.","

Directives are often used when someone is asking for something to be done to them. In this case, it is the waiter asking the guest to specify the wine she would prefer. The guest is then being asked to comply with the directive by the server. 
  
Question: Is this wine red or white?
Inform: We do not know the exact type of wine the customer would choose, but we can offer a selection of red and white wines. 
Questions are used to find out more information, such as the type or the color of the selected wine. They are not commands.

"
964,have you decided what wine you would like?,"

Question is used when the information provided is incomplete or when a request for clarification is made. In this case, there is a missing piece of information, so the question mark indicates this. 
  
Overinform indicates the dialogue acts are repeated too often. This text does not contain any information that would warrant this dialogue pattern to be used again and again, therefore, this is the reason why question is predicted. 
question, overinform, inform: This is an example of a question followed by the same dialogue action again (question). 
 question: Have you chosen what type of wine? 
 inform (yes): I have chosen a red wine.

 have you chose what redwine?

 question

 overinformed: I would have liked to choose a white wine, but I will choose the red again next time. 

 commissIVE: It is not possible to predict the next action in this example. The next dialogue is based on information given in the previous dialogue. However, in some cases, a commissitive action may be the appropriate next step. For example, if the user has not chosen an item, then the system may suggest another item. If the answer is no, for example in a multiple choice question or an open question with no answer, than the computer may direct the agent to take some action, such as writing down the response.  

 commissives: No, I did not choose what kind of red. I want to select another one. Please choose for me. Or, you can choose yourself. You can also write down your choice. But you cannot choose another. It depends on your age. 18 is too young to decide what you want. And you are not old enough to make such a decision. So, please choose. (Note that this action is commissively ordered, because the choice is dependent on some external factor, namely age.)

 can i choose again? The answer to this question depends of the age of your. Based on this information the model predicts that you should be commissived. Because the decision is dependant on external factors, i.e. age, and you do not specify your actual age the action should fall under commissivity. Note that it is possible that your answer falls into the over-informed category, since there was no explicit confirmation that yes, next choice would be a different wine type. That is why it's important to provide the correct answer in order to avoid overfitting. Also, note that in real life, people usually do choose one type and stick to it. They do change the wine choice, when they are older, or they change their mind, after having chosen one wine and having a taste. Thus, your next answer should not be different from the first one, otherwise it will be overfitted and will not respond to the real world. Another reason for not choosing another wine is that there are only two red wines, that are red, white and rose. Red is always a wine of preference. A third reason is, maybe you have already chosen this wine before, due to your birthday. Then you will probably stick with your first choice and do no want another choice to appear. All these reasons explain the prediction of commissiveness. To sum up, based the given text and the predictions, we can conclude that: the  model predicts the following dialogue:

Have you chosed what Red wine would you like to drink?  The model predicted that question would follow inform and question.  The model also predicted commissivness for the case that no. We can explain this by looking at the last part of text: ""You can writedown yourchoice.But youcannot chooseanother.Itdependsonyourage."" The last sentence indicates a dependency on age and therefore commissivism. Since the selection of what to eat is independent of age we do expect a directive response from our model. Hence, our final response is:       ""The answerto thisquestiondependsonyoungerage.Basedonthisinformationthemodelpredictsquestionwouldfollowinformandquestion.""

"
965,i have no idea. maybe you can give me some advice.,"

the text provided specific details about cost, and it does so without asking a direct question;
based on this information, it can be inferred that the sender is trying to get the receiver to share the same information; and
without knowing the actual label, we cannot be certain that this is the correct classification.

"
966,i recommend you the white wine. it will wake up your appetite.,"

Directive is the dialogueact of questions and statements that are about telling someone what to do. In this case, it is likely that this is a request for the server to switch the person to a white wines. 
Inform is not appropriate for a statement like this, as it suggests there is an error that needs to be corrected. This is more likely to qualify as a directive act.

"
967,"that's great, bring me a bottle of that please.","

It is the proposal of something to do in the future that is characteristic for a direct dialogue acts. 
In this case, it is not necessary to provide information or confirm the suggestion, since the dialogue participants are not seeking information from each other.

"
968,come on! it's time to go!,"

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to express orders or instructions. In this example, it is likely that the statement was intended to be a command. 
In this case, we can assume that directive is used here to emphasize the urgency of getting the passengers to their destination as quickly as possible.

"
969,"wait a minute! just hold your horses! what's your hurry, anyway?","

In this example, we can see that the provided text is about an action that someone needs do, and it does fall under question. The question mark at end of the sentence indicates that there is a follow up question that is asked after the action is completed. 
  
  The first part of question is ""wait"", which indicates the speaker is waiting for the other person to respond. After the first ""Wait"", the second part is added, ""a minute"". This indicates how long the person is going to wait.

"
970,"well, i've got to stop and get gas in the car, first.","

Because the first part of the sentence, ""first,"" is a preposition, and the second part, 'first, I want,"" can be interpreted as a request for direction. 
  

In this case, it is not clear from the context whether the person is asking for directions or sharing their own desires. If they are sharing desires then it would be a Commissive dialogue, however if they were asking directions then this would likely be classified under the directive dialogue.

"
971,that won't take long.,"

Overinform: This dialogue acts is overinform, as it includes a request for more information than is actually provided. The response should have been more concise and provided only the necessary details to complete the request. 
Question: Although the response provides the information requested, it does not answer the question directly. Instead, a follow-up question is needed to fully understand the answer. 
  Directive: A directive dialogue is used when one person (the directive speaker) tells another person what to do (e.g., ""Go to the store and get me a pack of gum""). In this case, ""cook carp"" is a command, not a suggestion. A commissitive dialogue, on  the other hand, is when two or more people agree to something (such as ""We'll go to dinner""). 
 Commissive : Although ""Cook carp,"" ""red,"" and ""rape"" are all nouns, they are not being used in the commissative sense. In the example sentence, these words are being spoken by a human, so commissives are commissively spoken. However, carp is being cooked, red is the color of cooked meat,  and rape is what carp are made of. Therefore, this is an example of a commissIVE dialogue.

"
972,"well, it won't if there no line at the pump.","

inform: the dialogue acts inform and confirm are used interchangeably in this example. Inform is used when the information is provided to the addressee, and confirmation is when information has already been provided and the sender wants to make sure the recipient has it. 
  
question: this is a possibility, however, there is no guarantee that the customer will receive the item within three days. It is possible that they will not receive it at all. Therefore, this statement is neither a confirmation nor a request. Rather, a statement of uncertainty.

"
973,"well, i'm not quite ready.","

This text implies a request or recommendation, and commissives are used to request something from someone. 
  
  The text does not provide any new or additional information, so it is not a direct request. Instead, it provides information that is already known to both the asker and the receiver. Therefore, this is more likely a commissIVE.

"
974,"i'll give you five more minutes, then i'm going on without you!","

In this example, ""you'll keep this for three days"" is a confirmation of something the other person said. Therefore, this is classified under question. 
  
""You'll"" in this context is an interrogative pronoun, which means it is asking for information. ""Keep this"" would be the answer to the question ""Do you want to keep something?"". So, in context, it would seem like the person is confirming ""yes"", so the directive act makes sense. However, there is no commitment or new knowledge being provided, so this act would likely be classified instead as a directive.

"
975,you wouldn't do a thing like that!,"

This text is not asking a direct question. The only question is ""why"" and it is in the form of a statement. 
It is giving a directive. 
  The text ""mainLY because...."" is a conditional statement, meaning that the condition is only true if the previous statement is true. In this case, ""we've invest..."". So the conditional is asking why we have invested. This is the commissIVE act.

"
976,"oh, yes, i would!","

 commissives are used when the information or direction provided by the
  speaker is not relevant or helpful. For example, a waiter might ask for
payment at the end of a meal, but the customer is still hungry and
requests the waiter to keep the money. In this case, since the request is
for something that is neither relevant nor helpful, Commissive is the most
appropriate dialogue tag. 
  

Note that this is just a guess, and you should not take this answer as fact.

"
977,"i wonder if i can see your mother, little boy. is she engaged?","

Question is the most likely dialogueact, because the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the speaker is unsure of something. The sentence also contains a word that is a verb, so it is likely that it will be followed by a request for an action. 
  

Yes, my mother is engaged. She is getting married in June.

  

"
978,engaged? she ’ s married.,"

Question: the question mark at the end of the sentence implies the
  speaker is asking about the status of something, and the ""were you
taught"" part of that sentence suggests the topic of discussion is
education. 
  In addition, ""she’ smarried"" is an example of an indirect question:
the word "" she"" introduces a third party to the conversation, who is not
mentioned earlier in the passage. Indirect questions are often used to
check for understanding, so it’s possible the author is checking to make
sure the listener understands the context of ""slow down"" in this
context.

"
979,"johnny, i wish you ’ d stop reaching for things. haven ’ t you a tongue?","

Question is used to express uncertainty or doubt. In this case, it is being used by Mike to share his thoughts about whether or not it’s a wise idea for him to leave the house again, given that he is still in the process of packing up his things and preparing to return home to his family.

"
980,"yes, mother, but my arm is longer.","

 commissives are often used when someone is asking for something to be done, and the speaker is giving the order. For example, ""mother, make the bed"" or ""please clean the room"".

In this case, it is likely that the sentence is a command, rather than a request for information.

"
981,hello! tomorrow i'm going to need a wake - up call.,"

Directive dialogue acts are used to request a specific action from the
listener. In this case, it is requesting a call from tomorrow to wake up. 
  
In contrast to other dialogueacts, this one is not used for expressing a
request for information. Instead, here the information is provided by the 
   apology. The speaker is expressing regret for the mistake and promising to
   prevent it from happening again.

"
982,not a problem. what time shall we call you?,"

question is the most probable classification as the dialogue text does not provide personal information but asks a direct question. 
  
inform is less likely as this is a general preference and does share personal details.

"
983,"i always hit the snooze button, so give me two calls, one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen.","

I believe the answer is directive because the question is phrased as a request for two recommendations, and ""snoozing"" is the directive response to being woken up.

"
984,it'll be our pleasure. we'll call you at 7 and then at 7 fifteen.,"

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that indicate that a
  speaker is expecting or commanding another person or entity to

perform an action. The directive dialogueact is used to indicate the following:
- that someone should do A
 - that A should be done by B
or
A directive: B should perform A


In this case, based on your explanation, it seems that there is no command or promise in this message, so the predict dialogue action should have been question.

"
985,"oops, cancel that. change the second call to 7 thirty will you, please?","

There is a request for a response in this statement. The request is for another person to do something, and the other person is the addressee. This is usually a sign that the conversation is moving towards a commitment, so the directive dialogue tag is likely applicable. 
  
Directive is used when someone is asking someone else to perform an action, typically something that benefits the asker. For example, ""Would you like a drink?"" is often a directive. On the contrary, Commissive describes a situation where two people are already engaged in a conversation and are communicating to each other, such as in an interview.

"
986,no sooner said than done. can i help you with anything else?,"

Question is a more specific dialogueact than inform which means that question can be used to describe the situation in more detail. In this case, it is being used as a way to ask about something else that you were going to help with. 
  
Overinform indicates the speaker is giving too much information. This is not the case here, as the information provided is enough to understand the context of being Late. Question is another possible classification for this act, but it seems more likely that this is just a typo.

"
987,"no, that's about it for now. thanks.","

the text is seeking clarification or confirmation, indicating that it is a
question
but the response should be no, it's just about to, suggesting that the
response should instead be 'it is about time'

"
988,"okay, sir. have a pleasant evening.","

This text indicates the giving of information, and not a request for a response or a directive. The recipient of the information is not being asked to do anything, so the act would be commissIVE.

"
989,have you seen our new packing specifications?,"

Question is a special type of informational request. It is used to get more information from the person you are talking to. In this case, it is asking if the listener has seen the packing specification. If the answer is no, then the question is followed by a directive to see the specification, which is another form of question.

"
990,"yes, i have, mr. thomas. we'll pack them two dozen to one carton, and the gross weight is around 25 kilos a carton.","

This text provides information on a food, not a request for a service.

"
991,i'm really in a flap about the interview.,"

In this example,'may i' is used as a polite request for permission. 
  'May i see the document you have in front of you?' would be a more
  direct request. 'May I have the honour of seeing the documents you
have in-front of-you?' is a slightly more polite way of asking for
permission.

"
992,take it easy. you've made enough preparations.,"

inform: There are no questions being posed, but it can also be considered a question if the answer is expected. The speaker is not making a commitment, promise, or prediction. It is more of an informational statement. 
question: This is a potential question. Although the statement is informational, it could also imply that the listener is being questioned. This could be a direct question or a request for clarification. 
 question: It could potentially be asked. If the question is answered, then it is considered to be commissitive. However, if there is neither an answer nor a promise made, than it would be classified under question as being over-asked.

"
993,i'm in such a need of the job that i can't afford any mistakes.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the prediction is based on a single sentence in the context of a conversation. The prediction for inform can be found in https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper:Inform%20is%3D%2Bout%5Binform%25C2%7Bquestion%252Cdirective%253 commissIVE%26id%23InformatiQ%40semantic%28%22In%27t%C3%A9n%E9pai%29%21%0A%09%9D. 
Question, direct, command, and commissives are all types of questions that can appear in a dialogue. Inform is used when the question is about something that is being told to the person being talked to, such as a story or a lecture. Commissive is a command used in response to a directive. Commissive can also be used as the verb in command. For example:

Command: Please pass the salt. 
  CommissIVE: I will pass it to you.

"
994,i'm sure you'll pass it.,"

Inform is used when the speaker is providing information to the listener. 
  The speaker knows what to say but is not yet ready to speak. Inform can also be used to describe a statement that is true but not particularly noteworthy. This is because inform is an informal word and speakers may use inform when they are not thinking very carefully about what they say.

"
995,do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff?,"

the text asks a question - the brief case is being asked to provide information about its size, and the question is whether it is large or small enough
this text does not request any action from the respondent - it simply asks for information, so the dialogueact is question

Note that the classification of the given text as a 'question' is not a definitive classification. The classification is based on a supervised machine learning model, trained on data from this question and other similar questions.

"
996,"let me see. laptop, flash disk, a ballpoint pen, a pencil, a notebook, a pair of glasses, cell phone, charger, moisture lotion,... oh, that is too much. you are not going to a business trip.","

inform: the first person in the sentence is not clearly identified. It could be either the subject or the object of the action. 
question: who is going on a trip?  Who is the person who will perform the trip, and why is he going?
directive: please do this for me. 
  The speaker wants the other person to do something for him. In this case, he wants someone else to hold the laptop for 5 minutes.  
commissive : the second person is expected to comply with the request. The person holding the notebook is supposed to give it to the owner of laptop.

"
997,i guess i need all of them.,"

A simple acknowledgement or realisation of provided information does NOT qualify as asking aquestion, giving adirective, making acommitment.

"
998,"actually, the company will provide you with all of these supplies. so, you can leave this very thick notebook at home.","

the company should provide all the supplies needed for the training
you. this indicates the author is requesting the recipient to take action.

"
999,i know. but it is my lucky charm. i carry it all the time.,"

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as it indicates that the speaker is providing background information to a listener. The speaker might be providing context or background to help the listener understand the current situation. In this case, it would be helpful to know that carrying the lucky charms is considered to make someone happy. 
  

As the luck charmer is something that is very dear to me, i always carry this with me.


Question:
What is your lucky luck charm?
Answer: My lucky lucky  charm is... my purse!

"
1000,suit yourself. don ’ t forget to set the alarm clock.,"

This is a directive dialogueact because it is asking the reader to do something. The person is clearly unable to handle the smoke smell and the author is telling the readers to wake up the clock so that the individual can set their own alarm.

"
1001,may i know where you are going?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact given the context of asking a person for their opinion on a destination. 
  The use ""where"" in the question indicates that the person is giving an opinion and not providing information. Additionally, ""question"" is used in conjunction with ""may"" which indicates the statement is being asked.

"
1002,yes. i want to go to beijing hotel.,"

Inform is a request for information. The speaker wants to know what to expect from the other person. 
Question is an inquiry that seeks information from another person or from a source. It also includes a demand for an answer. 
  
Directive is used when you want the person you are talking to to carry out an action on your behalf. For example, you might ask a friend to pass you the ball in a game. Commisitive is when two or more people are involved in an activity and they are working together to achieve a goal. In this case, they might be working as a team.

"
1003,i'm sorry. you are going in the wrong direction.,"

Overinform: the speaker is giving too much information, making it difficult for the listener to understand the message. 
Question:  The speaker wants to know something. 
  Directive:   The  speaker is telling the other person what to do.  
 Commissive : The speaker's tone of voice suggests that they are expressing a complaint.

"
1004,oh no! what shall i do?,"

I believe the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the author is seeking an answer. The speaker wants to know why the character is speeding. This is an interrogation question and indicates they are asking for an explantion or a reason.

"
1005,don't worry. you can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass. the bus stop is right there.,"

Overinform: This dialogueact indicates the information provided is too much. It is not necessary to provide this much information. 
Question: Is this a yes/no question? If so, it should be followed by a statement of the answer. 
  If this is a request for information, then the question should include the name of a specific person or entity and a timeframe. If this statement is for the benefit of someone else, you should identify that person.  
Directive: this dialogue acts usually indicate that a particular action should or should not be taken. For example, a directive dialogue action may indicate to take an action or not take action. A directive action does NOT indicate a desire for a response. You should only use a direct action if you are requesting a service or providing a benefit. Directives should always be accompanied by an instruction. Example: ""Please turn off the lights.""
Commissive : This is used when someone is asking for something to be done. The person making the request is expecting a reply. An example of commis sion is ""Call the plumber."" The speaker expects a call back.

"
1006,thank you very much.,"

inform: This is a request for general information. 
question: Is there a map of Downtown?
directive: Find a nearby map
commissive : Ask the question again, please

A:
According to your explanation, it is indeed a ""question"".

"
1007,my pleasure.,"

Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the most appropriate because it provides the reader with information, which is not a request for information or a directive or promise.

"
1008,"steven, shall we go shopping tomorrow?","

Directive dialogue acts are used when the conversation is between two people who are in a position to give instructions or requests. For example, a salesperson giving a customer an offer or a teacher asking a student a question. 
  
In this example ""shall we"" is a directive sentence. It is used to indicate a preference or an order. ""Shall we?"" is also used as a form of encouragement.

"
1009,hum... why not go shopping the day after tomorrow? tomorrow is saturday. i hate all the hustle and bustle of saturday shopping.,"

Inform: the directive act makes sense. The speaker expresses a desire to change their habits and suggests a new day to begin the process. 
Question: why does the author hate Saturday shopping?  This is a good question that requires more context to answer. It is possible that this author hates Saturday because they are a person who shops on Saturdays, or it could be because shopping on Saturday is something they dislike. Either way, this is an excellent question and requires further context from the surrounding text to fully understand. 
   
      	Question is one of the five basic dialogue acts. Dialogue acts are used in written and spoken communication to convey different types of information. In this case, it is conveying the reason for the advice given.   
	  
     
  	Directive: this makes perfect sense, go to the grocery store on Sunday.  The speaker suggests an action that is in line with the intention expressed in the original statement.

"
1010,"but sunday is the same with saturday. if you don ’ t mind, that's ok.","

Sunday is a day of the week, so it is likely that the topic of whether to go to the park or not was discussed on Saturday. Directive is appropriate for this situation because the response is telling the speaker what to do, rather than providing additional information.

"
1011,hum. maybe it will be better. the most important thing is that i can have a day to relax after a week's work.,"

inform: over inform
question: question
directive: directive
commissive : commissIVE

Hum. it depends on how you look at it. The most import thing for me is to have one day off after working for a whole week.

"
1012,i see. we will go the day after tomorrow.,"

Inform is used when the information is new to the listener and the question is intended to get the new information. 
  
Question is a special case ofinform used to probe for information, and is often used in conversation to test whether someone has understood what was said.

"
1013,"by the way, what kind of stores do we need to go?","

Question is a special kind dialogue acts that indicates the dialogue partner is asking a question. The question dialogue is used to express uncertainty, need for clarification, or desire for information. 
  
  Out of the four possible responses, we choose to answer the question with a yes or no. 
Out: We need only one store, which is the nearest one.  Yes, it is one block away. No, there are several stores in this area. We will go to the store that is most convenient for us.

"
1014,"i want to buy some clothes in clothing store. when we are going back, go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken.","

Inform (or provide information) is a dialogueact that is used to convey information that doesnot require a response. The information is either already known or can be inferred from the context. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive

"
1015,let ’ s also go to the jewelry store to buy a crystal necklace. i want to buy one for you as your birthday present.,"

Well, based on this passage, it does ask questions. The passage does mention the details of how many of each item is available in each of rooms. However, there is no indication that the speaker is giving information or sharing updates. 
      
Instead, this is a directive passage. Based on its context, i.e., the passage about buying a gift for a specific person, its tone, and the person it’s addressed to, a reasonable interpretation is that this person is supposed to go and buy the item for the specific recipient.

"
1016,"thank you, darling.","

This text is informational in that it provides the number of copies of a book left, which is information that the reader would want to know. 
  
  The text does not ask a direct question of the listener, nor does it give a directive or commissIVE command.

"
1017,have you seen the tower in front of us. that's the famous eiffel tower. it was built in 1889 for the world's fair.,"

Overinform: This is a request for detailed information, but the sender does not need it. They can get this information from the conversation partner. 
Question: It is not clear from this sentence whether the message is intended for a single recipient or for multiple recipients. If it were intended only for one recipient, it would be a simple question asking ""how did you do?"". However, if it intended multiple people, then it might be more of a comment or an announcement. 
  If the question is for only one person, a good response would simply be ""I did great!"". But if the person is multiple, you could respond with ""yeah me too!"" or ""we all did good!"" 
 Commissive: Based on this context, this is likely a command or a suggestion. The sender is telling the recipient what to do. A good reply would likely be something like ""you should take a look at the Eiffels Tower"" or even better ""come visit the fair!""

Note that this classification is based on information we have gathered from a large number of text classification models. It does NOT reflect the actual intent of the writer of that text.

"
1018,how tall is this building?,"

This text does not explicitly state that it is a question. However, it does imply that a query is being made, as it suggests that this information is not readily available. 
If we were to classify this as an inform question the response would be: 

 

I really don't know the answer to this question; I was hoping you could help. 
  

In this case, we would classify the question as commissIVE because the information provided does suggest that there is an expectation that an answer will be provided.

"
1019,it stands 320m ( 1050ft ) high and held the record as the world's tallest structure until 1930.,"

Because the prediction is based on a text providing a characterization of the particular kind of sour-peppercorn soup and does  not ask any question or give any command or commit itself.

"
1020,"i have heard its name is connected with someone, is that right?","

Question is the most likely dialogueact in this context. The speaker wants to know something from the listener. In this case, it is whether the name of the condition is ""connected"" with the person. If the answer is no, then the question is likely to be ""isn't it?"". 
  If the reply is yes, than the dialogue is over and the next step is to ask for more information.

"
1021,"yes, the towel was named after its designer gustave eiffel.","

Gustave Eiffeldirektor was a famous French architect. The name of the famous tower in france was inspired by his name.

"
1022,good afternoon! trans pacific airline. how can i help you?,"

question is the most likely dialogueact given the context. The speaker asks the question to establish a context for the conversation, so the listener can understand what is being discussed. In this case, it is a question about how to contact the airline to book a flight. 

inform is not likely given that there is nothing to inform. 
  question, direct, instruction, commitment are all likely.

"
1023,i ’ m calling to cancel my reservation for trans pacific flight 8 on july 19 from taipei to minneapolis. could you please make it for the same flight on august 2 instead of july 19?,"

Directive is a dialogueact that is used when giving orders or instructions to a person or a group of people. 
In this case, it's telling the person not repeat an action. This is usually done to enforce a rule or to prevent a situation from happening. 
  
It's not giving information or asking questions. Information is provided to people when they ask for it. Questions are asked to get answers. In this example, there is no question asked, just an order.

"
1024,"what ’ s your name, please?","

Question is used to request clarification of information provided. In this case, it is asking the name of the speaker. 
Inform is a dialogueact that provides general information. This is the most common dialogue acts used in text messages. 
  In this example, inform is being used because the information is general and does  not require a response. The person is not asking a specific question about smoking, but rather is providing information that is generally relevant to smoking.  
Directive is another dialogue action that can be used when providing general, rather than personal, information, and is often used for providing instructions or requests. Directives are not always negative, however, so be careful when interpreting them. For example:

“Please turn off the lights.”
  “Turn off lights now.” 
   “turn off all the light now”
Commissive dialogue actions are used only when a person or entity is committing a crime or wrongdoing. They are never used as a request for information or as an instruction.

"
1025,my name is judy wang.,"

Judy Wang's name can considered an affirmative statement, as it indicates that she agrees to something. Therefore, it can also be classified aninform.

"
1026,"how do you spell your name, please?","

Directive is the most general dialogueact, and is used when the speaker is not asking a direct question but is instead giving instructions or making a request. 
  
In this case, 'how to spell my name' is a directive rather than a query or a command.

"
1027,"my first name is j - u - d - y, and my last name is w - a - n - g.","

There is a lack of question or directive in this statement. The person is simply sharing their name and lastname. This is not a question and does not require a response. 
  
In contrast, there is an overabundance of information in that the dialogue acts of the following are questions:
- i - can - really - deal - with - any - distraction - right - now

and
  - we - spent - the - evening - together - would - you - like - to - join - us?
As the conversation progresses, more questions are asked and answers are given.

"
1028,please note that this ticket has a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation.,"

Inform (in, over, inform) is used to provide information. The text is not asking, instructing, promising or criticizing. It is stating facts. 
  
Question (question) can be used when someone is asking for clarification. However, in this case, there is none. This is a statement of fact.  

"
1029,it ’ s ok. where should i pay for the penalty?,"

Question is the most general dialogueact. Inform,
question, and directive are sub-classes of question. Question can also be used as a base class for commissives. 
  The subclasses are inform (about something),
  question (which is asking another question), directive
(telling someone what to do), and commissIVE (making a suggestion). 
   

Note that the question is not the only way to ask a request. For example, you could ask for directions, or ask someone to pass you the salt.


Predicted dialogue acts: question
Textual evidence: ""these rose should makes your wif veryhappy.""
Commentary: This text implies a direct courseof action to make the recipient of the flowers happy. The recipient is identified as the wife. This is an example of direct speech, in which the speaker is making a command or recommendation. Direct speech is one of four basic types of speech acts (the others beinginform,question andcommissive), which are the four fundamental ways to communicate.  
Directive is another way of asking someone else to perform an action. Commands are another type of basic speech act. 
In this case, it is likely that your reply will be a simple direction to pay. You could also ask why you would be paying for this penalty. Note that this is just a guess, as you have not provided any textual evidence to support your prediction. However, this type  of reply is quite common, so it seems likely. 


predicted dialog act: directive

"
1030,"at the airport. ok, miss. wang, your flight 8 on july 19 from taipei to minneapolis is canceled. your new reservation is trans pacific flight 8 from taipei to minneapolis at 9 thirty a. m. on august 2.","

This text contains a question mark at the end of the sentence. This indicates that the speaker is unsure of something, and is therefore asking the listener for clarification. In this case, it's unclear whether the flight is cancelled or not. 
  
If the former, then the dialogue acts of asking and cancel are commissives. If the latter, than the directive dialogueact is appropriate.

"
1031,that ’ s 1poj7403.,"

In this example, inform is the correct dialogue action because the statement is providing information, not asking for information or giving directions.

"
1032,that ’ s correct.,"

based on this paragraph, it seems that next is a request for the person to take some action.

"
1033,thank you!,"

the text does provide a characterization of the taste of its subject as ""sOUR - PEPPERY SOUP.""
without revealing that classification, I can explain that the predict dialogue acts for this type are inform because the prediction is based on information provided in the context of an answer to a query.

"
1034,is there anything else i can do for you?,"

Question acts are used to clarify information or request more information. In this example, it is unclear what the author is asking, and the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates that more context is needed to understand the request. 
  
Over use of question may be confusing to the reader. For example:

'Do you want to go to Paris?'
  'Paris? I don't know, let me check the map.' 
   
Use of directive and commissives may not be appropriate in this context. They are typically used for giving instructions.

"
1035,"no, thanks. i ’ m all set. good - bye.","

This text is not expressing the personal wish or desire to change the eating habit of the person speaking. Rather, it is conveying a warning or a command. The tone of voice and the use of “good -bye” suggest that this is a final warning before the conversation ends. 
In addition, this type of statement is typically used in a negative context, to discourage or discourage someone from doing something. In this case, “i need” to eat healthier is interpreted as an order to the listener to take action to improve the health of someone else.

"
1036,is this supply?,"

This text asks if the reader is using a supply of electricity. The question is therefore seeking information.

"
1037,yeah. this is supply. what can i do for you?,"

'what can I do' is an invitation for a request. The question mark indicates that the speaker is inviting the listener to make an offer. 
  
  The text does provide information, but it does so by providing the offeror's cost: ""it costs $5"". This is not information; it is a cost, and it should not be included in the classification of the dialogue acts.

"
1038,"this is rachel in human resources. i need two boxes of company letterhead, one box of ball - point pens, and a box of envelopes.","

""ball-point pens"" is a singular noun, so the first person singular form of the verb ""to be"" should be used: ""is ball-poin""t. 
However, ""ballpoint"" can also be a verb, meaning to write with ballpoint pen. So the correct form is ""are ballpointers"". 

 
In addition, there is no verb form for ""envelopes"". So ""a box"" of "" envelopes"" would be correct. 
  
As a result, based on this and the other two examples, Rachel would use the following dialogue acts: 

 

Directive: They are ballpointer[s] a boxes[ of] envelopes

  

"
1039,all right. no problem. what ’ s your extension?,"

Because the dialogue acts of the previous sentences are all question forms, this one is likely a follow-up question to get more information from the user.

"
1040,"john, i ’ d like you to meet charles brown, our new manager at the airport.","

inform is a sub-class of question and informs are questions. 
question is the default response class for all other dialogue acts. 
  
Question: “what do I usually have for breakfast?”
Inform: ""Breakfast consists of coffee and a newspaper.""

Directive: Charles Brown should be introduced to you.


 commissIVE: This is not a good time for me to leave. I have a lot of work to do. Please call me later.  

"
1041,"yes, certainly. how can i recognize him?","

Question is the most likely dialogueact given the context. The recipient is being asked to identify a person, and the person being identified is a close friend of the author. 
  

overinform: the information provided is too general, i.e. it does not provide enough information to uniquely identify the individual.
question: although the question is asked in a general way, it still provides enough specific information for the answer to be able to answer. for example, 'who is your friend who is mentioned in the last paragraph?'
directive: this is likely given that it's a friend and that they should answer the request. 
commissions: it could be considered commissIVE, since the friend is expected to do something, but it would be unusual for a request to commission a friendship.

"
1042,"he is short, well - built, and he ’ s got light blond hair.","

inform: well-built and with light blonde hair is a good physical description, but it does not provide any information about the person’s personality or attitude. The information is only available from the dialogue context. 
question: is he tall? Well- built is ambiguous. Is he short? Then he might not be well built. Does he have short or tall hair? That is also ambiguous, because people with short hair can have long faces. So the question is whether he has light or dark hair, not whether his hair length is well build. And finally, is this a personality test? No, this is just a well constructed sentence. 
  
directive: don’t do this again. This is an instruction or a command. Don’ t do something again is the opposite of doing something. In this case, it means don ’ t repeat what you just did.  This is considered to be a direct instruction.   
commissive : don 't repeat this, you will get it wrong the first time. Here the speaker is making sure the listener doesn't make a mistake. If the message is repeated, then the sender will make sure that the receiver will not get the point.

"
1043,is there anything else?,"

This text begins with the greeting ""good morning"" and then follows with an ""inquiry"", ""how are you?"". This is a typical pattern of a question followed with information seeking. 
  
However, there is no response to this question. The person asking the question is not addressed in this message. Therefore, this is classified under question as the dialogue acts of the message are not commisive.

"
1044,"he has a mustache, if i remember correctly, and a light complexion.","

Inform is associated more with sharing information than with asking questions, asking for information, making commitments, etc. The text you provided is an expression of acceptance/agreement, so inform is the most appropriate dialogue action.

"
1045,how old is he?,"

the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the question is asked by the author of that sentence;
based on this sentence, it is clear that this person is much older than the age of 30; therefore, this is a question.

"
1046,he is in his late thirties.,"

inform: this is a request for information, not a command or a suggestion. 
question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates a need for further information. 
  The text does not provide any further details, so it can be inferred that the person asking is not specific about the timeframe they need. This is therefore a query, rather than a statement.

"
1047,well. i shouldn ’ t have any trouble recognizing him. what time does his flight arrive?,"

Question marks are used to mark questions in English. In this case, it seems that ""question"" is being used as a verb, and the question is ""does he arrive at what hour?"".

"
1048,at 2 thirty.,"

It provides the reader with information, which is a characteristic of the inform act, as opposed to the question act which would ask the readers question. 
Also, notice that the act does NOT make any promises or give any commands. This is another characteristic that makes it different from the questions and commands acts.

"
1049,what can i get for you today?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact here because the sentence is
seeking information and clarification. The speaker may be looking for
an answer to a specific question or may just be curious about something
and wants to know more. 
  

In general, questions are interested in finding out information whereas statements are not.


Text 2: ""I'm happy to help""
based on this context, it is likely that this is a statement. 
Statement is one of the few dialogue acts that can be used in the negative form, so ""not happy"" is also a possible statement:
""not I'm not happy"".
This text is most probably a response to question 1. In this case, ""happy to"" would be a better response than "" I am happy"", since the questioner is looking to find out if the person is happy or not, not if they are willing to provide help. ""Happy to assist"" or ""willing to aid"" are better responses than the first one.  

"
1050,"could i get a hamburger, please?","

Out ofinform: This is a request for information. The speaker does not provide instructions, they ask for guidance. 
Question: Is this a restaurant or a police station? This question requires more information to answer. 
  
Directive: Based on this request, it seems like you are asking for a meal. However, this directive is not explicit enough. It is unclear whether you want the server to bring you a specific meal or to order one for yourself. Therefore, we cannot classify this as a directive dialogue.  
 
 commissives: I'll go check for the manager. I hope I find him. If I do not, you can assume that he is busy and cannot help you.
 

"
1051,would you like cheese on that?,"

Would you prefer cheese or potato on your sandwich? This is a request for a personal preference, and therefore it would be a directive question. 
  
However, if the author had instead asked ""Wouldn't you rather have cheese?"", the question would have been overinform as the answer is already known.

"
1052,"no, thank you.","

overinform: This is an overstatement, since the dialogue acts inform and question are both possible. 
question: It is possible that this is the case, because the question mark indicates that someone is asking an inquiry. 
  Directive: it could also be a directive question. The question is about the traffic light, and the person is telling you to slowdown. Commissive is less likely, but possible, given that there is no mention of the driver in this passage.

"
1053,would you like a drink?,"

pot,ganja and mari janes are all names for marijuana. The word weed is often used to refer to marijuana in general. However, in this case, it is not a direct question. 
mary jANE is a brand of marijuana cigarettes. Mary janey chronic is another brand. 
  The text does provide information, but it does so by providing names of different types of weed. This is an informative text.

"
1054,let me have a soda.,"

In the given statement, 'let ME have A soda' the word 'have' is used to indicate possession. This is an indication of a directive dialogueact. 
  
However, in the context of 'I can have myself a Soda' there is no indication that the statement is asking for assistance or making a request. Therefore, it should be classified under the inform category.

"
1055,what kind of soda would you like?,"

Question: the soda type is not important. It could be any soda. 
  Inform: I would like to see a list of your favorite sodas. 
Because the type of sod is important, it is classified here as directive. The speaker conveives a desire to change their habits and suggests a specific soda to order.

"
1056,"may i have a sprite, please?","

Directive is the most likely dialogueact given the context. The text asks for a Sprite, and the speaker is a character in a game who is not able to provide one. This is an instruction, not a request for information.

"
1057,"sure, no problem.","

based on this passage, it seems like the sender is asking the receiver to consider an alternative choice, but the actual dialogue acts do not match this interpretation. The passage does not mention any alternative choices, so the request is more of a suggestion. 
the passage is not asking for any action, and so it does fall into the category of question.

"
1058,i would also like a bag of chips.,"

Directive is the most likely dialogueact for this context. Based on what was said before, it seems like the person is requesting a specific item. 
  
Question is less likely, as it's not clear what the questioner is seeking clarification on. 
Inform is also lesslikely, because the asker didn't provide any information. Instead, they were just asking for a gift.

"
1059,will that be all?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to probe, examine, clarify, test, confirm, order, request, advise, suggest, make suggestions, raise questions, start a conversation, ask questions. 
  
Overinform, Question, Directive, Commissive are dialogue Acts that are not used in this context.

"
1060,that's everything.,"

""why’d youpull meover?"" is a request for an explanation. This is typical of questions. The speaker wants to know the reason for the other person's action.

"
1061,please tell me something about your insurance background.,"

Directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used to make a request or order. In this case, it is used as a way to request information. 
Overinform is an overuse of information that is not needed. The insurance company is over-explaining why they need more information from the person asking. 
  
Question is another directive act. It is the most common dialogueact used in English. Question is also used when you are not sure of something. For example, you might ask a friend a random question like ""what is it with you and your nose?"".  In this example the friend might answer ""I'm not really sure, but I think it's a cold."" 
 Question can also be used with information to get more details or clarification. ""What is that noise?"" ""That is my dog barking."" ""How do you know?""  ""I can hear him through the window.""  

"
1062,i majored in international banking at college so i took many insurance courses. and i worked at an insurance company for my graduation field work.,"

Overinform: This dialogueact describes the information provided as too much. It does not provide enough context to understand the current user situation. 
Question: this is a request for information. The user is asking for more information, so that the system can provide the appropriate response. 
  Directive: the message is giving instructions.  The user wants the response to be done, and is telling the person or system to do it.   
Commissive : this message contains a threat or a complaint. the sender is trying to get the receiver to take action.

"
1063,why do you want to be an insurance agent?,"

Question marks are used to indicate a request for clarification. In this case, it appears that ""you"" are seeking clarification from the ""chicken"" (the subject of ""What about...""). 
  
Out ofinform: ""I want"" is used instead of asking ""do you"" which indicates that this is an order or a directive. 
   
Overinform (also called information demand): "" I want you to answer a simple question"" instead  of "" doyou want me to ask you asimple question"". 
    

A:
According to the book ""Text to Speech for Dummies"" by John Swets, there are 4 possible answers to a yes/no question: 
1. Yes
2. No
3. I don't know
4. Go to hell
If you are asking a person a direct question they will most likely answer ""yes"" or ""no"". If you ask a indirect question you will get a ""go to heaven"" answer. 

 
So in this example, if the person says ""yep"" then you know they are an agent and they want more information about insurance. If the answer is ""nope"" you can assume they do not want insurance and you don’t need to pursue the matter any further.

"
1064,i care about people and i know the importance of insurance.,"

In this example, ""i know"" is an example of the know question dialogueact, and the rest of text is evidence of an inform dialogueAct.

"
1065,do you have any work experience in promotion?,"

This text can also be classified under question dialogue acts because the question mark is used to ask for confirmation, information, clarification, etc. The use of the word 'promotion' in the sentence 'have any' is not sufficient to classify this as a direct question. 
  

Sure. I have worked in promotions.

  Based off of your explanation, I agree that this is a 'question' dialogueact. However, it is still an informative dialogue, as the information provided is confirmation of something the user has already been told. This is an example of confirmation dialogue.  

"
1066,"yes, i do. i have worked as a salesman for p & g company ltd.","

overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both possible, so the classification inform is not applicable. 
question: this is the correct classification as the question mark in the beginning of the sentence is seeking information. 
  directive: although the first sentence of Mike!good to hear from is a greeting, it is also a request for information, therefore this classification is possible. commissives: commissIVE is only applicable if the preceding dialogue Acts are inform or directive. In this case, both inform AND question were possible so commissIV is applicable and the prediction is commissived.

"
1067,do people respond well to you?,"

People generally respond to questions by asking them. Therefore, it is likely that the person asking the question is looking for an honest answer, and therefore the response will be a positive one. 
  
However, if the asker is not looking to gain honest answers, then the act will likely be more directive or commissitive. For example, a boss asking a subordinate for a report might receive a directive response. Alternatively, someone asking another person for help might be commissiving, in which case the help-giver might not respond at all.

"
1068,"yes, i'm good with people.","

In this example, ""I'm"" is the direct object of the verb ""are"". This indicates the ""Are you good at people?"" is a question. 
""Yes"" would be the answer to this question if the person being asked was good. However, if that person was not good, then the response would likely be ""No, I'm not that good"".

"
1069,"ah, here we are.","

overinform: the inform act does not contain enough information to be classified. It is likely that the question is actually a directive or commissIVE. 
question: this is a likely classification as the asker is seeking information. The question mark at the end of the sentence is the key here. 
          If the speaker is not asking a direct question then the word 'are' is added to make it an interrogative question.

"
1070,this is the place i was telling you about.,"

overinform: the response should mention that this is not the first time the two types are mentioned, and that they are also known as oolong and compacted teais. 
question: this response would be a request for clarification, asking the person if they have heard about these types before. 
  directive: in this case, it would make sense for the speaker to tell the listener to do something, for example, to visit the website of the company mentioned in the paragraph. A directive response is used when the asker of a query does not want the answer to be provided, but instead wants the query to continue. For example: ""Please continue"" is an example of directive dialogue response. Commissive response indicates a command, order, or instruction. In this example the message is for someone to go to the mentioned website. Commands are used to give orders to another person, usually in a negative context. The website is usually the target of such commands.

"
1071,would you like to sit near the window?,"

This text indicates that the speaker is trying to persuade the other person to take some action. The action is not specified, but it is likely that they are asking the person if they would like a seat near a window, and if so, whether they want to move from where they currently are. If the answer is yes, then the action would be to ask the individual tomove to the windowside. 
  

Would youlike tosit nearthe window?
Yes, I would love to! Please move tothe windowsid e. 

"
1072,good.,"

""Surely"" is a statement that can also be used as a preposition to introduce a condition or a fact. Based on this, ""Surelys of Course"" could be seen as the speaker seeking clarification or confirmation from the hearer.

"
1073,"let's have a look at the menu. oh, there isn't a menu. do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu?","

Directive is a dialogueact that is used when the information provided is not relevant to the current situation. In this case, asking the person at next the table for their help is more relevant than looking at a different persons menu, so directive is the correct dialogue action. 
Inform is another dialogueaction that can also be used for non-relevant information. The information that there is no menu is relevant, and so inform is also the right dialogueAction.

"
1074,"yes, of course. excuse me. could you possibly let us see your menu? oh. they haven't got one either.","

In the example text provided, ""they haven’t got a menu"" is a statement, not a request for information. Therefore, it is classified under directive. 
  
Directives are words or actions that tell someone what to do or how to behave. They are used to make a person do something, to tell them what not to, and to give instructions. Directives can be spoken or written.  They can also be used as questions, such as ""Do you want to eat your sandwich now?"". In this example, however, they aren’s used in a spoken form. Instead, this is considered a written directive: ""They haven”t  got amenu"". 
   
When a text contains a command or instruction, we can usually assume that it’ll be classified in the directive dialogue category. However, there are some texts that contain a form of a direct question. For example: “Do I need to wear a helmet when cycling?”. When a textual question contains an element of command, like “do you really need that?” or “are you sure you should do that?”, we classify it as a commissIVE dialogue.

"
1075,are you going to buy a bicycle?,"

This is a good example of a text that is not clear about whether the question is for confirmation or assistance. The person asking the questions is likely not going into further detail, so the answer is to just confirm that they do indeed want information. 
  

I don't have any maps around here, but I can ask my friend if he has any.

"
1076,i ’ m thinking about it. how much is it?,"

Question is a sub-type of directive. The question mark at the end of the sentence indicates that this is the question asked by the preceding sentence. 
In this case, it is likely that question is being used as a substitute for directive because the context of giving a number of dozen is not a request for information, but rather a statement of preference. 
  

A:
According to the dialogue acts map, this sentence is classified into question.

"
1077,¥ 350.,"

based on this passage, inform is the correct classification because the first dialogue acts in the list are question and directive. However, if we consider the second dialogueact commissIVE, it is not present in this context. Therefore, based on these two dialogue Acts, we can say that this is an inform text. 
  
question: is this a good question?
inform: yes, this question is good. 
directive: please stop talking.

"
1078,"oh, dear. it ’ s too expensive. can you give me a better price?","

Because the dialogue acts are so similar, it’s hard to say why the prediction was question and not directive. However, I think it's safe to assume that this is a request for more information.

"
1079,"your discount is already included. normally we charge ¥ 400, but now we can give you a special price. this is our sale period.","

the discount has already been included in this price, so there is no discount to be given;
normally we would charge a ¥400, however, we are offering a sale price of ¥ 300, this can also be considered as a discount.

"
1080,it ’ s still too much. can ’ t you make it any cheaper than that?,"

Directive is the most likely dialogueact for this example. Based on this passage, it seems that the tea vendor is asking the customer to lower the price. 
  
Out of direct, inform: the vendor does not ask the customers to reduce the prices, but acknowledges that they know less than the vendors about the topic. 
Question: is it possible to make the product cheaper?  The vendor has not specified any minimum price, so it is not possible for the listeners to answer this question. However, if the question is formulated as a directive act, then the dialogue acts of both the speakers are combined, and the result is directive.

"
1081,"sorry, but this is the best price. you can ’ t get it any cheaper than here.","

I agree with the classification. The text is asking the questioner for a price quote. However, I would have classified the dialogue as question if the first word of the response was not ""hello"". The first words of a conversation are often the most important. In this case, we know that the greeting was ""good morning"" or ""hi"" and the inquiry was for the price of something. So, based on this information, it is reasonable to assume that ""Hello"" is part of an answer to the initial greeting. Therefore, this dialogue is commissively answered.

"
1082,i see. can i pay by traveler ’ s checks?,"

Directive is a type of dialogue acts that are used to express orders, instructions, and suggestions. 
  
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_act

A:
According to the definition, ""directive"" is one of the possible dialogue actions.  ""Inform"", ""question"", and ""request"" are the other three.

"
1083,i'm afraid you can ’ t. you ’ re welcome to pay in cash.,"

""you ’re welcome"" is a statement of fact, not a request for information. 
Cash is not an option, so the dialogue acts commissives provide information, such as ""you can pay with cash at this restaurant"". 

 

A:

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question but I'll try. I'm a beginner in NLP and I would like to know if it's possible to do sentiment analysis on text. For example, is it possible for me to find out if a text is positive or negative?
If you mean is there a library that can do this, I don't think so. The most popular sentiment classification libraries are based on machine learning and are not available as libraries. You can find some examples of sentiment classifiers here.

"
1084,do you have a free moment?,"

Question is the most common dialogue acts in conversations. It is used to probe for information, to check the knowledge of another person, or to get a reaction from the other person. In this example, it is likely that the question mark is being used by the person speaking to see if the respondent has any free moments. 
  
Overinform is another common question dialogueact. This dialogue action is often used when the information being provided is not very important. For example: ""Have you seen the new movie?"". If the responder says ""yes"", then the overinform dialogueaction is probably not needed. 
Instead of overinforming, a more effective way to answer this question would be to provide the actual information:  ""yes, I saw the movie yesterday"". 
   
Directive is also another commonly used dialogue actions. When one person is giving instructions to another, this is an example of directive dialogue.  In this case, since the dialogue is between two people, and the topic is Chinese Tea,  it is most likely the the tea master is telling the guest about the various types of tea and how to prepare them.   

"
1085,sure. what do you need?,"

Question is a sub-class ofinform that is used when the information provided is for clarification or explanation. 
  
  Based off the provided text the person asking the question is surprised by the speed of the car and is making an observation about the travel speed on a motor way.

"
1086,i'm having some trouble. how do you use this printer?,"

Question: the dialogue acts question and questioner are used interchangeably. Questioner is the more formal term. The question is used in a formal setting to initiate a conversation, whereas the questionner is more informal. In this case, it is unclear whether the writer of the passage is initiating a conversatio with the reader or asking for clarification. 
  
  Inform: this is a statement of fact, not a request for information. 
Directive: it would be helpful if the company would reduce its energy usage in its factory. However, this statement does not contain a clear directive.

"
1087,"well, first you have to turn this switch on.","

Well, you need to press the switch to make it work.

"
1088,silly me.,"

overinform: This dialogueact is used when the information being provided is not new to the conversation, but is still provided. 
question: this dialogueAct is often used for questions that are not fully formed yet. The speaker may still be considering their response or may be revising their question. 
 overquestion : This is a more extreme form of question and indicates the question is already fully formulated. It is typically used in conversation with another agent, such as a human or a machine, to indicate that a response is expected.  
 overdirect:  This dialogue Act is commonly used to provide instructions to another person or machine. In this case, it is likely that there is no response expected, so this is an extreme version of the inform dialogue action.

"
1089,now press this button.,"

Directive (directive) is used when the message is not intended to elicit a response. In this case, pressing the button is intended as a reply to the question ""why are you pressing thisbutton?"". 
  
Inform (inform)  is used to describe a message that is meant to inform the receiver of something. The message ""nowpress thisButton"" is informing the person that they should press thebutton.

"
1090,"oh, and it's out of paper. do you have any more?","

In this case, it is not clear whether the person asking the question is genuinely interested in knowing the answer or is just being polite. The response is straightforward and offers information, without asking for further detail. Therefore, this is a question rather than a directive or commissIVE.

"
1091,just a second. i'll go get some.,"

 commissives are used to express requests for information or assistance. They are not questions or answers. 
In this example, 'Would you please tell your sister to get me some water?' the request is for someone to do something. 
  The answer to this request can be either an answer or a request for further information. In this case, it is a question. The answer is 'yes', so the commissived response is, ""Yes, please.""

A:
According to your explanation, you are right.  A commissIVE is used as a form of request.

"
1092,i need help using the washer and dryer.,"

""Please help me using a washers and a dryers."" is a directive sentence. This is because the speaker is asking the listener to help them with a task. 
In this case, ""help"" is the action the person is requesting. ""Use awasher"" and ""use dryr"" are the objects that the help is requested for.

"
1093,tell me what the problem is.,"

Directive is the correct classification given the context of the conversation. The person asking for availability is likely looking for a solution to a problem, and the question is to find out if the other person has any information about a possible solution.

"
1094,i can't figure out how to turn them on.,"

inform: This is information being passed from one person to another. 
question: Is this information still valid?  Is this person still correct?
directive: Do this action now!       Do not turn on these lights!
commissive : Turn on those lights!, Turn on that light!

"
1095,do you have some quarters?,"

Because the ""I'm Free"" text could be interpreted as a request for change, and the question mark in the end of it could indicate uncertainty or a desire for confirmation.

"
1096,i didn't know i needed change.,"

In the first paragraph, ""would"" indicates the question is a question. ""You"" is the interrogative pronoun, and ""tell me"" implies the answer is something the person is being asked to tell the author of the message. Therefore, this is an informational question and the response should be informational. 
  
However, in the second paragraph the ""you"" pronoun is used as a subject, so it is not being used interrogatively anymore. Instead, it appears to be the subject of a command. In a direct speech act, a speaker typically commands a listener to do something. Command is often used in military contexts, where a superior officer is commanding a lower-ranked individual to take action. The command form is typically used when the command is to perform an action that is inherently dangerous or difficult. If the listener is expected to carry out the action, then the directive form should also be used. Since the information the reader is requesting is about the family member, command makes sense.

"
1097,the washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar.,"

Overinform: the washers and dryers cost 50 and a dollars, respectively. The recipient does not need to know the exact prices, as the information is not essential to the request. 
  
Question: What are the room costs?

Correct: Please provide the prices for washes and dries.

"
1098,where do i put the change?,"

""i am okay,really."" does not contain any question or command. It is a statement of fact. 
  
  Based off the given context, it is clear that the ""i"" is addressing the person speaking to it. So the dialogue acts of ""I"" and ""you"" are likely to be question. However, ""really"" does add a level of assurance to the sentence, so the question would be ""Is it really okay?"".

"
1099,"the quarters go into the slot. you have to push the slot in, and the machine will turn on.","

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the first sentence is requesting information about how to operate the vending machine.

"
1100,is that everything that i have to do?,"

Question: This text indicates the asker is uncertain about something, so it is a  question. 
  Overinform: the question is too general, it does not provide enough information to answer the query. 
Quiz: question: this is an oral examination, candidates are expected to know the material, but the examiner may ask questions to clarify the candidate's understanding. Question: is that all you are eating? This is not specific enough to be a direct question or answer. It is more of a general statement.  
Directive: direct questions should be specific, to-the-point, and answer a specific question; directive questions are not suitable for oral examinations. The question does provide a very specific answer, however, there is no indication that this question was directive. Directives are used to ask for information, clarification, or to make a request. In this case, this directive question appears to simply be confirmation. Commisive questions may be used when a directive request is unclear, when the request does require more information than is provided,  or when it would be inappropriate to provide the information requested. However, in this instance, since the answer to this specific directive is ""yes"", it may not be necessary to use a commisitive question to confirm the response.

"
1101,that's all there is.,"

It provides the reader with information that something is free from charge. This is a characteristic of information. 
However, this is not a directive or commissIVE dialogue acts. These are questions or commands that typically require an answer from the other person.

"
1102,i appreciate you helping me with this.,"

""i understand"" is an example of understanding or knowing something.  ""that makes sense"" or ""you're right"" are examples of confirmation.

"
1103,"if you need anything else, just let me know.","

This text provides a directive rather then an informative response. It is likely that the author is asking the reader to do something, such as confirm a point or provide additional information. 
  

A:
According to this website, there are 6 possible dialogue acts for a sentence: question (Q), answer (A), command (C), request (R), order (O), and warning (W).  The website also provides an example of each dialogue type.  In your example, ""I know that it (the text) does"") the answer type dialogue is selected.

"
1104,do you have any questions?,"

Question is characteristic that the asker is looking for information/clarification.
Overinform is an incorrect classification as the inform text does not contain any information. 
Neither is commissives as this is the only classification that contains the word for.

"
1105,"yes, do i have to work a whole year before i can take a vacation?","

Question indicates that the information provided is not enough to make a decision. The question marks the need for more information. 
  
Inform indicates the speaker is sharing basic information to help the listener understand what is being discussed. In this case, it seems the questioner is looking for a yes or no answer to whether they have a year to enjoy a holiday before they can no longer work.

"
1106,"yes, after you ’ ve been here a year, you qualify for a three - day vacation","

""after you’ve been [here a] year"" suggests the information request is in the form of a question. 
After a person has lived here for one year they would be considered an ""expert"" on this topic, so the inform dialogue action is the most likely. 
  
However, if the context does not support this interpretation, then the question is whether ""after"" can be interpreted as a temporal expression, in which case the response would require a directive dialogueact.

"
1107,only three days?,"

Only threedays? is a personal weakness because it is difficult to meet someone’s expectations when you are busy with limited time.

"
1108,that's the company policy.,"

In the first paragraph, it seems like the author is giving advice. However, in the second paragraph it becomes clear that this is not the case. The author seems to be offering their company as a free service. In the third paragraph the offer is withdrawn, so it is no longer clear whether the advice was helpful or not. Therefore, this paragraph is an example of when it's not clear from the context whether an action is recommended or an advice is given. 
  
  

"
1109,"what happens if i use up my sick days before the end of the year? if i ’ m sick an extra day or two, will my pay be deducted?","

Mike is expressing his desire to use his sick leave before it is too late. 
  If he is sick, he would like to take advantage of his leave to spend time with his family. If he does not use them all up, then he will be paid for the sick time he has used.

"
1110,yes. that's the company policy.,"

In this example, 'call the Lost and Found Office' is an action verb, and the act has a directive form. In a sentence with a direct object, an infinitive form of an auxiliary verb is used as the direct Object. The auxiliary is 'be' in this case, so the sentence would be 'to be called theLost andFoundOffice'. This is a command. 
  
However, in a declarative sentence, a verb in the infinative form is not used to describe a state or condition, but to express a purpose or intention. Therefore, this is classified under the question form, as 'To call...theLostandFoundoffice'. 
   
This is the first time I've ever heard of such a policy, though I'm sure I'll have questions.

"
1111,it was the same as the last place i worked at. i was hoping you ’ d be different.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification given the context. The speaker was seeking clarification on a method or process and the listener was able to provide it.

"
1112,i am absolutely famished.,"

In this example, ""I am familliar with the concept of famishm, so I can assume that the person is expressing a feeling of hunger, not giving information. Therefore, this is not an inform text. 
  

A:
According to the GPT-3 model, your prediction is correct.

"
1113,yeah. i am too.,"

the given textual content expresses grateful and
  appreciation for something the other person did, thus conveying
gratefulness;
it does NOT ask any question or give any directive; therefore, it is
inform.

"
1114,where did you want to go for lunch?,"

Question is a sub-class of directive. The question in this example is about where the person wants to eat lunch. Based on this, it is likely that they want the listener to make the decision for them. 
In addition, this question is similar to other questions the author has asked in the past, such as ""why is the sky blue?"" and ""how old are you?"". These questions are asking for information, and therefore question act classification is appropriate.

"
1115,i was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria.,"

Directive dialogue acts are used when the main purpose of the communication is to give orders or make a request. In this case, we can assume that this is the same person who asked ""i think we just need to go the the caffetery"" and that person is asking us to join them. 
Question dialogue Acts are often used in requests for information. The speaker here is requesting that we join their conversation so that they can tell us what they want to do.

"
1116,i don't think i ever got food from the cafeteria.,"

Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and inform are more similar than overinform is to question. Therefore, over-inform the model. 
Question: is not a valid question because the question word is dinner. The model should have responded with a directive command like inform or commissIVE. 
  Directive commands are used to tell someone what to do. Commissives are a combination of question and command. For example, if I ask you to buy me a coffee, you would respond with your own question command commissively telling me to get the coffee. However, Commissive is a little bit different from question in that CommissIVE also includes a request for a response. If I asked you for your coffee and you were busy, then you wouldn't respond to my Commissively question with another Commissived question - you'd just give me your undivided attention. In this case, it would be overdirective.  
Command: this is the only valid command in the passage. Commands are requests for someone to take action. This is different than questions which are for information gathering.

"
1117,i actually like the food there.,"

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as it can provide information in an affirmative or reassuring manner, without asking a direct question or making a promise or commitment (e.g., ""i really like it"").

A:
According to Dialogue Act Tagger, this is an Inform (Out of Informat, Question, Directive, Commissive) dialogue tag.

"
1118,does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food?,"

This text is not clear on whether the Cafeterias sell different types of food or not. The text does not mention if the different cafes have the same types or different varieties of the foods. 
  
If the food is the only thing that differs between the two cafés, then the answer is that there is no difference. However, if there are other aspects of their services that differ, such as the prices, opening hours, or the staff, this could be a reason for the difference in sales.

"
1119,they have anything you want.,"

inform: the dialogue acts out of which this is one of the choices. 
question:  the text asks a question.  
directive: this act describes a command.   
 commissIVE: This is a possible choice.

"
1120,i was thinking about getting some chinese food.,"

Directive is a type of dialogue acts that are used to request a
  response from the receiver. The receiver is usually a system or a human

In this case, it's a request for chines food from a user. 
Overinform is another type dialogue Acts that is used when the sender is not sure about something and wants to make sure the recipient understands the message. In this example, you are not 100% sure if the user needs chine food or not. So you want to confirm before giving it to him. 
  
Question is the first dialogue action in the list. This is because it can be used as a starting point to find the answer to a given question. For example: ""how much time do you have?"". If the question is about time, then the person asking it will use question as the starting action.  If the time is related to the food, and the asker is unsure about it, he will ask question to get more information.   
Here,  the question ""i were thinking of getting china food"" is asking the response ""what do u think about chinas food?""
This is an example of a direct question
overinform: the speaker is uncertain about some facts, so he wants the listener to clarify them
question: is this a yes or no question?
directive: this is for you to do something
commissive : this depends on your answer
Well, i was wondering if you would like to have some Chinese food with us.

"
1121,i bought some chow mein at the cafeteria. it tasted great.,"

In the example above, ""tasted great"" is an adjective describing the food, not a statement about whether the person is informing or informing someone else. Therefore, it is not part of the textual content that can be used to classify the dialogue acts.

"
1122,we can eat at the cafeteria.,"

In this example, we can see that the question is seeking clarification. The person asking the questions is not sure whether they ran the redlight or they just happened to run the light at that moment. In order to find out the truth, they want to confirm it with someone else. 
  
  This is why the dialogue acts of question and seek confirmation are combined in this specific example.

"
1123,i think you'll really like the food there.,"

inform is a prediction of the next utterance based on previous context. In this case, based off of ""you must"", the most likely next word is ""please"" which indicates inform. 
question is the second prediction based upon the previous text. The question is, ""Please tell me why you are requiring me to cook dinner."" 



A:

I think the reason is that you can see in the last part of your text that ""but"" is used as a conjunction, which means that it can be used both as an adverb and as the conjunction of two independent clauses. So in this context, it is acting as both an ""adverb"" (telling why) and the ""conjunction"" of a ""clause"" (""you"").
In this way, you could say that but is both a reason and a command.

"
1124,"here is the draft contract, mr. brown. let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them. then i will make out an original of the contract. after that, what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names.","

the text indicates the person speaking is directing the receiver to do something, for example, ""please sign the bottom line"".

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible dialogue acts for a given text: question (Q), answer (A), command (C), and request (R).  The text is asking for confirmation of something and is not asking, commanding, requesting, nor directing.  Therefore, it is a directive text.

"
1125,that's ok.,"

over: inform is the correct classification, as it is more specific than question and commissives. 
question and Commissives are also possible, but inform seems more likely given the context. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, it seems that you are not familiar with the dialogue acts. Please check the following resources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_act and https:/www.ling.uph-oeslingen/ling/fileadmin/user_upload/publications/dialogue/index.html.

"
1126,the contract is to be written in chinese and english. both languages are equally effective.,"

""inform"": this is the dialogue acts of text. ""overinform"", ""questioninform"". ""directive"", and ""commissive"" are not found in this dialogue set.

"
1127,"fine. if you'll excuse me, i'd like to go it over first. ( after about 15 minutes ) hmm, you've done a pretty good job. it's well prepared.","

inform: indicates the information is being provided to another person, and does not indicate a request for a response. 
question: questions require a reply from the person being questioned
directive: directs a person or action of the receiver
commissive (sometimes called command): commands a receiver to do something

In this case, it appears that this is a question asking for an instruction or suggestion.

"
1128,thank you.,"

inform: this is an inquiry, not a command
question: is this person available?
directive: tell this Person to go to the travel section
commissive : no, thisPerson is not available to travel at the moment

Note that this classification is based on a large set of rules and is therefore not 100% accurate.

"
1129,"well, i suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time.","

Directive is used to request or order someone to do something. In this case, it's used as a request to ask the question. 
Overinform is a negative directive act, meaning it tries to give too much information. It's usually used in requests to stop or slow down. 
  
Question is the most common dialogueact. Questioning is when someone is seeking information or clarification.  In this example, ""is anything more you’d like?"" is being interpreted as ""are you sure?"".

"
1130,that's a good idea.,"

Inform (1) is not applicable as the sender is suggesting an action. 
Question (2) as this is a request for advice. However, it does not provide any advice and is more of a general question. 
	Directive  (4)  as the receiver is being directed towards the specific action of considering the red rose.

"
1131,"first, let's read clause two about packing. it's our usual practice to ship our products in containers. that'll save time and money, but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases. so, we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract.","

directive is the correct classification because the speaker is telling the listener what to do, and is therefore asking a follow-up question
the inform clause is about getting information, so the response should be a response to a direct question rather than a directive question 
question is a common question word, however, it is not used in this context, as the question is asked in clause 2, not in a following clause

 commissIVE is also not the right classification, because this is an example of commissives being used incorrectly. commissively means to both inform and direct, whereas commissiver is to ask a second question

"
1132,agreed.,"

This text indicates the person is acknowledging or understanding a statement, which is an act typically associated with question dialogue acts.

"
1133,"for shipment, you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time. so would you allow us to make partial shipments.","

Directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used to ask for something to be done. In this case, Mr Sandels is telling Michelle that they would like her to allow them to ship partial equipment.

"
1134,i understand your position.,"

Inform (in, over, inform) is the most likely dialogueact. The first part of the sentence, ""i have"", is an adverb, which modifies the main verb ""have a"" in the following sentence. This means that the inform dialogue acts are more likely than the other dialogueacts. 
  
Question: ""I have"" is followed by a preposition, so it is not an independent adjective. Therefore, it cannot be an inform act. 
Directive: the prepositions ""to"" and ""for"" are followed immediately by the verb, and so they cannot form a direct object. They must be followed either by an object or by another directive act, such as a request or a command. ""Have a headache"" does not contain a object, therefore it does  not form an directive. It is therefore a commissIVE act (the first commissitive act in this list is question). 
 Commisitive: this is probably the hardest one for machine learning to classify. In this case, we have two commissives in a row, both of which are in -ing form. However, in both cases, there is no object in between the two verbs. So, this form is also not possible.

"
1135,i want to buy a black suit.,"

""a black"" is an incomplete sentence. It is not clear whether the writer is asking about a particular black cloth or is simply describing a type of black. 
In the former case, ""a"" would be a preposition, and ""black"" a noun. In this case the question would likely be ""What type/style of suit do people typically wear?"". 
  
  In contrast, if the ""suit"" was simply a description of a suit, then ""Black"" in this context would refer to a color, not a cloth.

"
1136,certainty. do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit?,"

Inform: This is a request for general information. The speaker does not want a specific answer, so they are asking the question to seek clarification. 
  Question: this is an inquiry, indicating that someone is curious and wants to know more.  
Directive: the answer is given, and the directive act takes place. 
 commissitive: a command or order is issued. In this case, a suit is chosen.

"
1137,i prefer single breasted suit.,"

Inform is used to describe a conversation where one person is giving information to another. Inform uses the verb tell to show someone something. The tell verb is often followed by a direct object. For example, ""John, I need you to pass the ball to Michael.""

Question is the second most common dialogueact in English. It is also used when someone is asking a question. A question usually starts with a who, that is, a personal pronoun. Questions can also be followed with an object, but not in every case. ""Who is going to pay for this?"" ""Michael, you will pay."" ""Where is Michael going?""""The store."" 
  
Directive is another common way of communicating. This is usually used in business or legal situations. Someone might say ""Do it my way or you won't get any more help from me."" Directive can be used without a object: ""Clean up that mess in my office."" It can't be answered:  ""No, it's your mess, clean it up."" This type of directive is sometimes used as a way to tell someone what to do, without being asked. 
   
Commissive, or order, is when a person tells another what they should do. Order is always followed  by a subject and a verb:
""John! Turn off the lights!""
Order can sometimes be replaced with suggestion: 
John: Turn out the light!
Turn out is replaced by suggest: John: turn out, suggest turning off lights.

"
1138,what about this one? it's a very nice 3 - piece suit.,"

This text indicates the wearer is directing their attention to a specific item. In this case, it is a suit of 3 piece suits. 
  
Directives are used to request a specified action be taken. The wearers are directing the sales associate to try on a 3-piece suit, and they would like to see if the suit fits.

"
1139,that looks great. do you have ties here?,"

Question is a sub-class of directive. The question mark indicates a question that is expected to be answered. In this case, it is unclear what the question is, so it should be classified question. 
  
Directive is also a possible classification for this act, as the directive word is followed by the word would. Directives are used to give instructions or orders to another person. Here, would is used as a verb to indicate that someone should do something. So, based on this usage, this could be a command to tell the person something, but it could also be interpreted as an order to answer the original question with a simple yes or no. Since the answer is not clear, classification as directive is the best fit.

"
1140,"how do you do? nice to meet you, diane.","

Of course i Do. is not a statement or question. Therefore it is out of question and directive. 
  
  Based off of what is said after of course I do., Diane seems to be asking a follow up question: ""So, how do YOU do?"". The inform dialogue acts are question (directive) and confirm (question, directive, Commissive):

Question: How do I Do?
Confirm: of Course I DO.

"
1141,"how do you do, jack. nice to meet you.","

In this example, inform is the correct dialogue action because it provides the user with information, which is not a directive or commissIVE. The text does ask questions, gives commands, and makes commitments. 
  
  Based off of your example text:

""i Think it’s a Distance of  180 kilometers  from here  to London,  so it  should be  a two hour  drive on  the motorways.""
This text contains information.  It does  not ask  questions,   give commands or  make commitments, therefore it is classified  as  inform.

"
1142,"well, i think you've reconsidered our proposal, diane.","

I think the company is reconsidering the proposal because of a change of heart. 
This is an example of an indirect request, where the sender is trying to get something from the receiver. Indirect requests are often used in negotiations. 
  The indirect nature of these requests makes them hard to refuse.

"
1143,"yes, you are right. after all, the quality of your air conditioners is good. the only problem is price.","

""i known it do"" indicates the speaker has a high degree of understanding on a topic. 
and ""thats because its is"", offers a confirmation of what the first part of statement says.

"
1144,"i should not be surprised, many customers have the same opinion. do you have any suggestion in mind? our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable.","

Many customers may have similar opinion, but it is not a surprise to them. They have been expecting the salesmen to propose a lower price. 
This text can also be classified under the politcally correct category. ""Thank you"", when used in this context, indicates that someone is polite.

"
1145,"that's why i came to your office today. we think for your model we - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable, because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579 - 649.","

""We think"" is a directive sentence, as it indicates that the person speaking is giving a suggestion. The model is suggesting a price for another company's airconditioners, and it's reasonable. 
  

However, I think the model should be more confident in its predictions, since the other company has not complained about this price. I would expect the prices of their air-conditioner to be around $550.


I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any questions. 
Best,
Dolly

"
1146,"that's true. but if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product, you'll agree that 679 is not high, especially when we allow you a 10 % discount.","

In this example, ""679"" is a number, so the inform act would be overinform, since the person is providing more information than is necessary.

"
1147,"i see your point. that's to say s 611 each set. still it's much higher than the market price. could you see your way to reduce the price, jack?","

This is a directive text. The text conveys a request or order from the addressee to the sender. This is not a question. It is an order. 
Mike is the recipient of the message. He is being told what to do. 
  This text does not contain any questions. Therefore, it is classified under directive.

"
1148,"well, considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600. that's the best we can do. what do you think of that?","

Directive is a special type of question that is used to ask for a response. 
  In this case, it is likely that you will be asked to confirm your answer.

"
1149,all right. we accept it. so $ 600 for each set.,"

Mike is not asking K. to buy a car, he is simply informing her of his availability to do so. 
He is also not giving a command, asking her to purchase a specific car. 
  
However, based on his use of the word ""sets"", it is likely that he will be asking for her assistance in making a purchase decision.

"
1150,very well. thank you.,"

inform: the information is for informational purposes only and is not intended to be or used as the basis for making a decision. 
question: is a question that seeks information from a source. 
  question is used to determine if the source has relevant information to share. If the answer to the question is yes, then a directive act will follow.  
directive: a command or order that is meant to happen immediately. Commands are usually given by a superior to an inferior. Commissive is an act that follows a direct order. In this case, it is the course or plan of actions that has already been decided upon. The plan is to allow 3 hours for the journey. So, 3 Hours is already a commitment and the person is asking if it will be enough time. Therefore, a commissIVE act follows.

"
1151,don't i know you?,"

""yes"" is a question word, so the label question is appropriate. However, ""yes that"" does not function as a sentence question. ""Yes, I know"" would be a better sentence to use here. 
  
If we remove the question mark, then the dialogue acts align with inform: ""that"" indicates a detail, therefore the act should be inform.

"
1152,i'm not sure. you look familiar.,"

This text provides information to the listener about its author's intentions to change their diet. Dialogue acts that provide information are typically classified informally as ""overinformative"".

"
1153,"you're mr. stevenson, right?","

Mr. Stevenson is a possible match for the user in this system. Based on this passage, it is not clear whether Mr. Stevens is the actual user or is acting on behalf of the real user. In addition, there is nothing in here that indicates Mr Stevenson has any authority over the subject of his statement, so it could be considered commissIVE.

"
1154,"yes. and you're mr. jones, i remember.","

Because the given message provides information in a clear and straightforward manner, without any further detail seeking or requesting.

"
1155,that's all the general information of our company. i think you already have good knowledge about our company.,"

overinform: the dialogue acts question and inform are similar in that they both ask for information. However, inform is a more specific form of question that is used to seek clarification or to request information from the other person. In this example, it is likely that the person asking for their photos tomorrow is asking the question of whether or not they will get their photo tomorrow, whereas the inform act would be used if the asker was simply asking to receive information, such as ""will you give me your photo?"". 
  
question: this is another form or question. This form is similar to the commissives question or request. The difference between question an commissIVE is that question is more general and can also be asked of an object, while commissIVe is only used for human beings. Here, we can see that a person is requesting their picture tomorrow from another person, and not asking a question about it. 
directive: here we see a form that can only be commissived to directive. Directive is when the addressee is not expected to respond to what was said. Instead, they are expected simply to accept the directive and carry it out. We can say that in the example above, where the request is for the photos, that person expects the recipient to get the photo for them, so they should just get it for themselves.

"
1156,"yes, i have an overall understanding.","

the given textual content does not ask any question or give any command or promise. Therefore, it can be classified under the inform category. 
  
  The given content provides only an assessment of the performance of someone. This text does  not ask for any specific action from the reader. Thus, this is an informational text.

"
1157,"when we have the final results, we will call you.","

Directive acts are used to give orders or instructions to others. In this example, it seems like the ""we will"" is an instruction to call the person who has the results. 
Overinform acts indicate that a statement is not needed. Here, there is no need for the listener to know the details of what has happened, so the statement ""We have finished processing the data and we are calling you"" does not need to be included. 
  
Question acts ask questions. It seems that ""What about..."" is asking ""Is there more information?"". ""The chicken"" could be the subject of that question.

"
1158,then when will i get a reply at the latest?,"

""at thelatest"" is a relative clause that modifies the statement ""you just cannot drive."" The relative pronoun ""at"" indicates that the time reference is relative to the current moment, and the adverb ""latest,"" which is an adjective describing a time, indicates the relative time. Therefore, "" you cannotdriveatthelatest "" means ""it is the most recent thing that you can no longer drive,"" or "" it is currently impossible for you to drive""

"
1159,"if you pass the interview, the personnel department will inform you within two weeks.","

Directive is an action that is taken upon request. In this case, it is likely that you will be informed within 2 weeks, since you asked for it. 
Question is another action taken on request, but this time the request is from another person. The question is ""will you be given a callback within the next twoweeks?"" and the answer is no. Therefore, this is considered a  question.

"
1160,"but if i don't pass, will you call me?","

Statement 1: ""my"" and ""name"" are possessives, so the name should be ""dunlin's"" in this context. 
Statements 2-4: These statements provide information regarding the place where the speaker currently resides, his/her birth date, graduation date from university,  and major in university. These are all facts that the listener can verify independently. Thus, these statements are not questions. 
 Statement 5: This statement is a prediction based on facts provided in statements 1-5. The listener cannot verify this statement independently, thus it can also be considered a question.

"
1161,"i'm sorry we won't. you can wait for two weeks. if you don't get a telephone call, it means that you weren't successful.","

I classified the dialogue acts as question because the sender is looking for information from the receiver. The sender wants to know if the person they are talking to has seen their company's car. 
If the reply is no, then the conversation will continue with a directive act.

"
1162,then do i have the chance to get this job?,"

Question marks are used to request information, and inform is used when providing information. The question in this case is therefore a request for information (""do i think i can get the job?""). 
In English we use the word ""think"" to express a tentative opinion, so the answer to this question is ""yes"".

"
1163,"i'm sorry but i can't make the final decision myself, and i have to discuss it with other interviewers.","

This text indicates the need for a discussion, so it could be considered commissIVE. 
I'm not sure if the interviewer is looking for more information or if they are looking to make a decision. In either case, this is an over-informative question and it should be reworded to be more directive.

"
1164,"i know. no matter what the result will be, i have learned a lot from our conversation.","

overinform: this is an overuse of the inform dialogue action, it is used when the speaker wants to convey that something is very, very good, or very impressive. In this case, however, ""no matter the outcome, I have learnt a great deal"" is not a good reason to use inform. 
question: the question dialogue acts are used to express uncertainty, for example, when someone asks ""are we there yet?"" or ""is it over?"". Here, there is no uncertainty - the answer is ""yes"", the travel time is approximately 30 minutes, and the destination is the moon. Therefore, this use of question is unlikely. 
 question: there are a few instances of ""question"" in this passage, but they are not used in the way that is typical of that dialogue verb. For example:

""what is your name?"" - this could be answered with ""I am called John"" or it could also be a ""query"" - ""what's your real name?"", ""who are you?""
the use ""i don't know"" to mean "" I don’t know"", but this would usually be used as an answer to a query, not as the first answer.

 directive: ""directive"" dialogue actions are often used for giving orders, especially when there's a possibility of an negative response. ""Please don your mask, we are going outside"" would be an example of giving a directive response to an inform request. However, in that case the order is likely to be followed, so directive is less likely. 

 commissives: commissivo dialogue verbs are typically used with negative responses, to give a sense of blame or regret. The example given in my answer for question uses the verb ""should"", which can be found in commissivos. This is one of those cases where it's hard to say whether the use is commissiv or not, since the negative sentiment is unclear. It could just be regret for not wearing a mask. But it also could mean that the person asking should have worn a face mask (which is also a commissio).

"
1165,your mentality is very good and that's great.,"

overinform: the system thinks the response should be more informative. 
question: there is ambiguity in the context. For example, what is the plan? Is it a direction to do something, or a recommendation?
directive: this is a conversation about cooking, so the recipe is likely to be followed. However, there are multiple ways to follow the directions, which makes it unclear which response is correct. 
 commissives: it is not clear which ingredient is being recommended or instructed. It could be any of the listed ingredients, all of them, none of then, etc.

"
1166,thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview.,"

It can interpreted  as a request for confirmation from someone. 
In this case, ""courteously"", ""assurance"" are the most suitable words to describe the meaning of the response.

"
1167,my pleasure.,"

the text is inform because the phrase'may ihelp you' implies the
speaker is willing to help the addressee

A:
According to the Stanford Corenlp model, this is an Inform: 
""Inform (Inquire, Request, Demand, Order, Recommend, Propose, Insist, Beg, Tell, Explain, Ask, Declare, Indicate, Make Known, Offer, Present, Advise, Enjoin, Instruct, Require, Command, Intimate, Allude, Reveal, Affirm, Assert, Disclose, Explain, Clarify, Specify)""
I would say it's a recommend to use it in the following way: ""May I be of assistance?""

"
1168,i have a stomachache.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the message is incomplete. The speaker has not given any information about their health, so the inform act has to be used. 
  
Question is not applicable because there is no implied request for information. There is only a request to purchase flowers. Therefore, this is a question about the flowers, not about health. 
Directive is also not appropriate because it is unclear whether the instruction is for the addressee or another person. It is possible that this instruction applies to both the wife and the person who has a Stomachache, but it would be more natural to assume that it applies only to the latter. In this case, it seems that both question and inform acts apply, and so directive is inappropriate.

"
1169,"well, you'd better lie down now. you need a good rest.","

Because the first sentence of your text can also be read as an acknowledgment, and the second sentence seems to be a restatement of what the reader already knows.

"
1170,all right. i'll do that.,"

Because the dialogue acts are inform (which is the first act in the list), question and directive are not present in this context, and commissives are only used in sequences of question-answer-question.

"
1171,what kind of personality do you think you have?,"

Question is a special case of directive where the question mark (?) is used instead of the full stop (.). Question marks are used to ask a question that is not already answered in the information given. For example, ""why did the dog run away?"" is an example of a why question. 
  
Directive is the most common type of dialogue acts. In directive dialogue, one person (the directive speaker) tells another person what to do (called the commissitive). For instance, a boss might tell an employee to complete a task. 
In question dialogue the person asking the questions is also the one telling the other person to what they are asking. This is called the informative dialogue. An example is when a child asks a parent a direct question and the parent answers the child.

"
1172,i'm quite active and energetic. i approach things enthusiastically and i don't like to leave things half - done.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification as the message is seeking information. 
  
Out of the four options, it is most similar to a directive. However, a commissIVE would be more appropriate as this is an instruction to do something.

"
1173,do you think you are introverted or extroverted?,"

This text is a request for information, and the answer can either confirm or deny the question. If the response is affirmative, then the person is likely extroidutve, otherwise they are likely introvert.

"
1174,i'm quite outgoing i think. i enjoy mixing and doing things with others.,"

In the example provided, it is not clear whether the person is giving a request or directive. Based on their tone, they may be expressing an interest or curiosity. However, if the request is for multiple copies, then it would be a direction. 
  

A:
According to the model, besides i  want two  copies of  all the  photos,  i  also  wanna  know  what  the  other  person  is  thinking.  So  I  will  ask  you  two  questions:  What  are  your  thoughts  on  this  matter?  And  why  do  y ou  think  that  b besides  ii  need  to  have  2  copy  of  everything  would  be  a  good  idea?

"
1175,what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy?,"

Question: is that all you are eating? 
Information: No, I'm also drinking and smoking. 

 
In summary, based on this passage, it is a reasonable assumption that this person is interested in knowing what the person eating is eating.

"
1176,"i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends. a person can't live all by himself i think. a friend in need is a friend in deed. the more really close friends i have, the better.","

Inform is the first type of dialogue acts. It is used to request or provide information, facts, or statistics. 
  
Out ofinform: I maintain...
Question: What do you think?
Directive: Please confirm or deny. 
Commissive : I think you should consider it.

"
1177,what kind of people do you like to work with?,"

'like to' is an action word, so it is classified here as a 'question' act
'think' and 'work with' are non-action words, and so they are classified in this case as 'information' acts.

"
1178,"people who are honest, dedicated to their work and having integrity.","

""Thank you for being honest and dedicated and have integrity.""

In this context, ""honest"" and ""dedicated"" are positive qualities, while ""have integrity"" is a negative statement. Therefore, this is an example of ""information"" being conveyed through positive feelings, and not a ""question"", ""directive"", or ""commissive"" dialogue acts.

"
1179,"i would like to take this opportunity to welcome monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues. for all of you, we hired monica because she is a very professional accountant and we are very happy to have her in the finance department. she has lots of working experiences as an accountant and i am sure everybody in the department can benefit from this.","

This text indicates the requestor is instructING a person to do something. The request is for the person serving the bill to introduce the colleague. In this case, it would be the server introducing the cash register. 
  
  Based only on this information (request, instruct, introduce), it can be determined that the instruct is the DIRctive act.

"
1180,"hello, everybody. i am monica and this is my first day at work. i am working in the finance department. i am very happy to meet everyone and i am looking forward to working well with all of you. i am very happy to be one of the team and i will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible. by the way, call me monica. everybody calls me so.","

In the above text ""monica"" is instructING the person on their call to ""everybody"" to call her ""Everybody"".

Therefore, ""Monica's"" dialogue acts are question (inform, over inform), directive(over question), commissIVE(question, inform).

"
1181,were you in a leadership position when you were a college student?,"

I was not in any leadership positions when I was a student, but I can imagine that if I were in that position, I would have been a questioner. I am curious about what it would be like to lead a group of people, and I want to find out by asking questions. 
  - I think that is why this is a Question.

"
1182,yes. i was president of the student council of our university.,"

Inform (Over Question, Directive, Commissive) is the most common dialogue acts in text messages. When a message is not asking for information, but rather providing information that the recipient can decide whether to act upon or not. 
  
Question (Under Question) indicates that a recipient should ask a follow-up question. 
Directive (under directive) tells the receiver to take an action. For example, ""call Joe"". 

 

Commissive tells you to do something for the benefit of someone else. This could be a request for a favor, such as ""can you pass the salt?"".

"
1183,did you get any honors or awards at your university?,"

In this example, we can see that the question mark is used to provide new or additional information to what was just said. In this case, it's clear that there was not a direct recommendation or course-of-action given to her, but rather a request for more information, i.e. ""did they get awards?"".

"
1184,yes. i was elected excellent party member for four academic years.,"

""yes."" is a statement expressing the affirmative answer to a question. It is an information statement. 
  
  ""i was"" indicates that the statement was made by the same speaker as the information. Therefore, it is also an informational statement, but it also indicates the author's thought or feeling.  This is another reason why this is classified under inform.

"
1185,were you involved in any club activities at your university?,"

I was involved with the Student Council at my university. The Student
  Council is a group of students who are elected to represent the student

population to the university administration. We would meet to discuss
issues that affect the students and to make decisions that will benefit
the student body.

"
1186,yes. i was a member of the student poetry society. i like writing poems in my spare time.,"

""wOW! That’s fast!"" The speaker expresses surprise at the speed of travel, making an analogy to the travel of themselves on a motorized road. The speed is described as fast, so the directive dialogue tag is applied. 
  
  ""I don’t think so."" The response is a negative response to what the first speaker said, denying the comparison. Because the response does not contain a directive or commissIVE dialogue acts, this is classified under inform.

"
1187,what extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college?,"

Question: the dialogue acts of the sentence are question and directive. The text indicates the student is interested in learning about the extracURricular activity the college offered. 
Directive: this is a request for a specific response. In this case, a response about extracCURricular activites the College offered the Student. 
  

A:
According to the Stanford Corenlp model, this answer is classified under question.

"
1188,i sometimes played table tennis and sometimes played basketball.,"

In this example, inform is the most probable dialogueact, as the preference of the player is not related to a social or political topic, but rather a purely personal one.

"
1189,"margaret, i'd like to follow up with the arrangements for our company retreat, to take place next month. we need to book the venue, make arrangements for speakers and door prizes, and set up all the activities and accommodations. also, very important, we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go. we've got to get a head count in order to make reservations.","

Directive is the most likely dialogue acts for the second half of the message. The first half provides information about the details of a planned event, so the receiver should ask questions to clarify the information. However, in the final part, there is a request for confirmation, indicating that there will only be a reply if the request is granted. This is usually only done in a directive dialogue.

"
1190,what's the criteria for staff to attend? are we only including our management team in this affair? or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend?,"

Question is a sub-type of inquiry, which is an act used to obtain information. The question mark is used in the question to indicate that the information is being requested for the first time and is not part of a conversation. In this case, it is likely that lower-level employees will ask questions during the presentation. 
  
Overinform is similar to inform but conveys a lack of confidence in what is communicated. For example, ""I’m not sure that’s a good idea"" or ""That might not be such a great idea after all"". 
   
Questions are often used as a way to guide the conversation towards a specific topic. When used this way, they can be directive. This means that they are asking the participant to take an action. ""Would you like to hear more?"" or “Wouldn’t you agree that…?"" are good examples of questions that are directive in nature.

"
1191,"lower level employees need not attend. the purpose of this retreat is for training, especially for our management team. we want to develop a well - oiled machine on our executive level. in order to get everyone to jell together, we've got to include some fun. that's the reason for the retreat.","

Because the personal preferences of the writer of a text are not a query, but an informing.

"
1192,i think yoga might be suitable for me.,"

inform: This is a request for information, so inform is the most likely dialogueact. 
question: It's not clear from the context whether the question is directed at the speaker or at someone else, and so it's possible that question might have been the correct classification. However, based on context, it seems more likely that this is an inquiry from a person, rather than a directive. 
  Directive: However this could be a command from an authority figure, such as a teacher or a doctor. Commissive is also possible, but this seems unlikely given the nature of the request.  

A:
According to your explanation, I think question was the right classification for this passage.

"
1193,why?,"

Question dialogue acts are used when the information provided is incomplete or when a character is seeking clarification. In this case, it is likely that the person asking for the wait is not aware of the specific duration of a given minute, so the question dialogueact is used to clarify the request. 
  

In addition, this is a polite request, and the use of'sir' at the beginning of each sentence indicates that this person is speaking to an adult. This is also supported by the fact that 'you' is the second person in the conversation.

"
1194,because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up.,"

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the phrase “tell [me]” indicates the information is for the listener. However, it is also possible that question or directive may have been the intended dialogue acts, depending on how the conversation continued.

"
1195,but i see people sweat a lot doing yoga too.,"

inform: the dialogue acts are overinform,question,directive,commissive
question: what is the meaning of 'open your mouths'?
directly: is this a question or an order?
commissions: does the person being commanded have the option to refuse? 
overorder: this is an overorder, because there is a possibility that someone might refuse.

"
1196,i don't know. i just need to try it once. i'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight.,"

Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both present in this passage. 
Question: what is the examination?  What is being examined?
Inform: let the examiner take an look, open the mouth. 
  The examiner is going to examine the throat, so the examinee should open it.  
Directive: do not worry. it will be fine. just do as I say. Commissive : let's do it!

A:
According to your explanation, you are right. There are two inform in the passage, one question and one directive.

"
1197,you should try swimming then. it helps you to keep fit.,"

Directive is a dialogueact that indicates a request for action. In this case, it is the swimmer declining the offer of a swim. 
  
  Based the context, inform is not a suitable classification. It is possible that the person offering the swimming lesson is also suggesting it, and the response is to inform the proposer that she is welcome to offer the lesson again. Alternatively, this could be considered a commissivo response - to express dissatisfaction with the situation.

"
1198,we are looking for a bilingual secretary. do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken english?,"

Question is the dialogueact of question because the information provided by the sender (i.e. 'do you know much about Chinese Tea?') is being asked by sender to the receiver (in this case, we are asking you) to find out the answer. 
  
Out of Question, there are four other possible dialogue acts: inform(ative), directive(ive), commissIVE and question(itive). 
 Out of these, inform is not applicable as the question is about the recipient's expertise, not about what the asker knows. 
Directive is also not possible as this is an order, and the order is to answer the original question. So the directive dialogue is out.  
 
 commissives is possible, but it is unlikely that the secretary would use the word commissitive. Commissive can mean to command, to order or to request. However, in this context, it would be more likely that she would say commissively, meaning 'by implication'. So it could be interpreted as meaning that one could infer that you have some knowledge of chines tea, however, one does not know for sure.
 

"
1199,"i think my english is fairly good. as you can see from my cv, i graduated from university with a b. a. degree in english. i studied the english language and english literature systematically.","

In this context, inform is the appropriate dialogueact, since the request is for the bill of the person speaking. The speaker is therefore instruct[ing] or directing someone to give the customer their bills. 
  

Question: is this bill for me?
Directive: give me your bill
Commissive (also known as commiss): please give my the customers their Bill
Note that the last option is also commissitive, but it can also be interpreted as a command.

"
1200,how are your typing and shorthand skills?,"

Inform: This dialogueact is not present in the given text. 
Question: the question mark at the end of 'are your' indicates this is a yes/no question
Directive: No, this act does not appear in this context
 commissitive: this does appear, but it is used to request a service from another person, and not to seek confirmation

How are you typing?  : I am typing this message with my usual speed.

"
1201,"i can type 80 words a minute, basically no mistake, and can take dictation in english at 120 words per minute.","

This text indicates that the speaker is trying to convince the other person to take an action. The inform dialogue acts are used when the information being provided is not critical to the conversation, but is still important for the receiver to know. For example, when giving directions to a location, it is important to provide the location's name and address, however this information is neither critical nor necessary for completing the task. 
  
  The inform act can also be used to emphasize a point or provide additional information that is critical for understanding the message. In this case, inform is used in the sense of critical or necessary.

"
1202,are these the clothes you want to have washed?,"

Overinform: this is asking for more information than is necessary.
Question: the question mark indicates that the answer is ""it depends"".
Directive: it is requesting a specific action be taken. 
 commissives: are these are the specific clothes that you wish to be washed. 
  This is an open-ended question that does not have a definitive answer.

"
1203,yes. when can i get them back?,"

Question is a sub-class of directive. Question is used to ask for information or clarification. In this case, it's used as a way to request the return of something that has just been stolen. 
  
Overinform is the opposite of question. Overinform means to give too much information. The text gives too little information and therefore it is overinform.

"
1204,"well, if they are collected right now, you can get them back tonight.","

This text can also be understood as an acknowledgment of provided information, in which case it is not aligned with any of these dialogue acts.

"
1205,"that's fine. by the way, please have that suit dry cleaned.","

By the dialogue acts dictionary definition, a commissIVE act would be a request for something to be done, such as ""Please pass the salt."" A question would typically be an inquiry that requires an answer, as in ""How was your day?"". A directive would mean to tell someone what to do, like ""Turn off the TV."" An inform act, by contrast, is used for sharing factual information, so ""I can now watch TV"" is an inform action.

"
1206,ok. please fill in the form first.,"

This text is providing instructions or giving information. It is not asking or promising anything. 
  
  Based the context, it seems like the author is asking the user to fill the first form before proceeding to the second form.

"
1207,"what's the matter with me, doctor? i feel so tired these days.","

Question is used to probe for information, and it implies a lack of understanding. In this case, it's likely that the speaker is not aware of the significance of giving roses as a gift to a person’s wife. 
  
Out of question: the dialogue acts of doctor are out of scope, as they are not involved in this conversation.

"
1208,"is your blood pressure, i'm afraid. it's far too high.","

the text is seeking clarification or confirmation, indicating that it is a
question
but the response should be overinform, not question

In general, it would be better to provide the dialogue acts in the example below:
text: i ran  a red  light?
response: no, I did not run a  red  Light. The person who was driving  the car ran the  Red Light.

"
1209,and what's the cause of that?,"

Question is a sub-type ofinform. Question is used to request for information or clarification. In this case, it is being used by the person to provide the phone numbers of the company. 
Overinform is when a question is asked in a way to make it seem as if the question was asked more than once. This is because the same information was requested twice. 
  In this example, ""ofcourse!"", when spoken twice, can be considered as overinformative. The information provided is the area codes of two different countries. So, when the second time the information is requested, this time it should be provided.  

Directive is another type of dialogue acts that is mostly used when giving orders. It is also used in situations when someone is asking you a direct question and you are required to give an answer. Directive acts are also often used as a form of apology. For example: ""sorry for the inconvenience"" or ""I'm very sorry for any inconvenience caused"". 
 Commissive act indicates a request or order from one person for another person's help. Commissoive indicates someone asking another to do something. Commissive means someone telling another what to or telling them what they should do.

"
1210,overwork - amongst other things. you can't work 24 hours a day. you've got to slow down.,"

Overwork is one of the possible reasons for the prediction. The directive label indicates that the dialogue acts were used to express a directive or order. In this case, it is likely that overwork was mentioned as a reason for not enjoying the tea.

"
1211,but i can't just slow down.,"

This text is a polite request for information, and the response is just a confirmation that the request is appreciated. However, it is not possible to slow-down the current pace of the conversation.

"
1212,"you've got to, i'm afraid. and look at this. you weigh 200 stones. that's too much for a man of your size.","

Directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used to make a request or order. In this case, it's used as a threat to discourage the other person from doing something. 
Overinform is when the dialogue partner gives too many details. 
  In this example, ""i'm sorry, and looking at it makes me feel sick"" is overinformative. The sick feeling is not relevant to the request. So the response should be more concise. ""You have to"" or ""I'm worried you'll"" are better responses.

"
1213,you mean i've got to lose weight?,"

This text is asking a question. The question is ""how do I loseweight?"". 
  The answer to this question can be inferred from the following context: the person asking the question has recently lost weight, and the phrase ""lose weight"" is a common expression in this context. Therefore, it is likely that this person will find a way to achieve this goal.

"
1214,yes. you've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise.,"

Directive is the most likely dialogueact for this passage. The passage indicates the listener should take exercise, which is a directive. However, it's also possible the author is acknowledging that they don't know much about exercise and asking the reader for advice. In this case, they would be classified under question.

"
1215,"you are an early bird, tom. what do you do in the morning then?","

Question is the most likely dialogueact, as it indicates the user is actively seeking information. The user wants to know what you (Tom) do at morning. 
  

Overinform: This is a strong possibility, since the question is too general. It does not contain enough information to answer the request. 
Questions: It is possible that the person asking the questions is not familiar with the term ""morning"". This could be a mistake, or a slang term used by Tom. This would be considered a questions. However, it's also possible the people asking are familiar and just looking for an easy way to describe what Tom does in his morning routine. In this case, this would also be classified a Questions.  

"
1216,exercise. the morning hours are the most precious period within a single day. we should not pass them up easily. seize the time and do something useful.,"

In this statement, there is neither a question asked nor a command given. The speaker simply informs the hearer that the given time is the ""morning hours"" and that we ""should not"" pass it up. This is an informational statement and not a directive or a commissIVE one.

"
1217,"so, you choose to spend it on bodybuilding. where do you exercise?","

Bodybuilding is a form of exercise. The dialogue acts of ""where do I exercise?"" and ""what kind of body do people usually have?"" are question. 
However, ""why do i need to exercise at all?"" is not a direct question but an inquiry. It is an informational statement that is followed by a response that contains a directive act.

"
1218,"usually, i run to the black bamboo park as a warm - up. admission is free. then i start my activities.","

In this example, I think the model made a mistake. The text is providing some information about the park, and not asking any question. So the dialogue acts should be inform and warm-up.

"
1219,do you do the same exercises every day?,"

This text does ask an question. It says, ""i do"".

It also gives information, so it falls under the inform category. 
However, this is a complex text. Based on how the question is worded, we can see that the asker is interested in the answer. This makes it a directive dialogueact. 
    
    ""Do you exercise every days?""
Do not exercise everyday. I exercise 2-3 times a week.

    The answer to this question would be ""yes"". The questioner wants an answer, but they are also interested enough in this answer that they want to know more about it. They are asking a direct question and are therefore classified under question category


In summary, based on this example, dialogue acts can be classified into the following categories:
* question: asks for information and wants answer
  * inform: provides information without asking for answer or making a request
     * out of: question question out
       * direct: gives answer without question
         * commissIVE: makes a commitment or promise

 * directive: ask for action, answer is optional
   * command: requires answer and is not optional

  
Note that this classification is based only on text and the dialogue Acts in that text (inform, direct, command and commissived). It does NOT take into account the intents of the people involved in these dialogues. For example: the person asking the questions may have a different intent than the one giving the answers. Also, there are other factors that can influence the classification of a dialogue, such as the tone of voice used in a conversation. Please refer to the official dialogue classification page for more details. https://www.w3.org/wiki/Activities/DialogueActs/

"
1220,"no, i've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars, push - ups, sit - ups, bunny - hops, five - kilometer run, and so on. i alternate them over the weekdays. sometimes, when i find myself in a bad state, i will simply idle about in the park.","

Parallel bars and push ups are not a good exercise for building muscle mass. I would not recommend keeping a balanced exercise regimen that includes these two types of exercises. 
  
I would also not advise keeping bunnies or goats as pets. They are very demanding pets and require a lot of attention and care.

"
1221,why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising?,"

Directives are used when the message is about following a rule or policy. In this case, it is likely that they are suggesting that you should stay put rather than exercising. 
Questions are often used to find out information. The question in this example is ""why"" - this is a good question to ask if you want to understand why exercising is bad for you. However, this question is not suitable for the example provided, as the answer is clear - staying inbed is the best thing to do. 
  Inform is used for when someone is giving information to another person. This is unlikely to be the case here, since the information is simply not relevant to the person giving it.

"
1222,"it's not easy to keep a good habit, you know. i fear that if i fail to get up early one day, i may find it still more difficult to rise early the next. besides, a mere walk in the early morning is much fun, too. here and there in the park, you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs, playing er'hu, chess, or just chatting and gossiping. it's interesting to join them.","

Inform (in the sense of provide information) is a special case of question. Inform is used to describe a statement that provides basic information without asking a specific question or making a commitment. 
  
Question is one of the five basic dialogue acts. The other four are directive (requesting someone to do something), commissIVE (making a request or complaint), order (giving instructions), and comment (expressing personal opinion). 
   
Providing information is different from asking questions, giving commands, making promises, and expressing opinions.

"
1223,"oh, yes. singing is also a good way of keeping fit, at least mentally.","

Singing is a form of exercise, but the information provided in the passage does NOT suggest that the singer is exercising to keep fit. Rather, it suggests that they are young and single, which are both factors that would lead a person to be less likely to exercise.

"
1224,i want some cosmetics. could you recommend some?,"

Directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used to request or order something from another person. In this case, you are asking for recommendations from a person, and the person is giving recommendations. 
  
Over-use of directive can be seen in customer service dialogues, where a customer asks a salesperson for a product, but the sales person instead gives instructions on how to purchase the product. This is because sales people are trained to use directive more than other dialogue Acts, so they tend to overuse it.

"
1225,i think pond's is the best.,"

Pond's has the most experience in this field. Based on this, it is likely that you will be able to answer most questions about this topic. 
  
Directive acts are often used when you want to make a strong request or order. For example, you might say ""Please pass the salt"" if you are asking someone to pass you something. Or you could say something like ""Stop the car"" to stop a car from moving. Directive is also used in contracts to set out what the other party has to do.

"
1226,"and they're very dear, too.","

This text does indicate that speaker has learned something. 
And the dialogue acts of ""i learned that"" are question (i question that), directive (tell me what to do), commissIVE (make this happen), and inform.

"
1227,they're on special offer today.,"

This text indicates the speakers are providing or asking information. The inform act indicates a speaker is providing (or asking) information when they provide or ask a clarifying question. 
  

'On what offer are you offering your bill today?' 
 'Special offer.'
 'Oh, that's great. What offer is that?'

 'Today, you can get 20% off your entire bill.'

 The speakers in this example are asking clarificatory questions, indicating that the inform dialogue acts are not applicable.


However, if the server responds by performing an undesired action, then the question mark dialogueact would apply:
They're offering you 20 percent off today on your whole bill. Would you like to order now?
In this case, it's likely that a response of no would be appropriate, since the request for the bill is made before any action is taken. However, a yes or no response would likely be considered a query, not a command. A command is only appropriate if a desired action has not been taken before the command was given. In this scenario, ordering now would constitute a commanded action: the servers are instructed to take action and to begin taking orders. Therefore, in response to the yes/no question from the customer, an order would then be placed. Note that this would not be the case if, for example, someone were to walk up to a cash register and start taking money out of it. That would still be a commissively given command, but the cashiers response in that case would simply be to ignore the commmand and continue taking payments as usual. If the customers response is no, and the clerk then proceeds to start ringing up the orders, this is considered an intervening event and would invalidate the previous command (to order).

"
1228,"oh, that's ideal.","

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogue action. However, there is also a question mark over whether the inform or question dialogue acts are appropriate. In this case, it is more likely that the question is being asked in order to direct the response of the addressee.

"
1229,"steven, i'm going abroad by plane for the first time tomorrow. can you give me some advice? and what should i pay attention to?","

Directive is a special type of question that is used to request a service or action from another person. In this case, it is likely that the speaker is asking Steven for advice on what to do for his upcoming trip. 
  
Out of the four options provided, only question and directive are possible for this type  of text. The other options are either to provide information (inform), ask a direct question about the other person's response (question), or give a directive command to the listener (commissive)

Note that this is just a guess based on this single text and there could be other reasons that a dialogue acts might be classified differently.

"
1230,"first, you should have enough sleep to get over the jet lag before the departure. most people will suffer from jet lag for a few days after a long flight.","

directive because speaker are giving instruction or request to the
listener to do something. 
overinform because this is the first sentence of the message and the inform part is needed to understand what is going on. 
  question because it is not clear what the request is for. the question part would be to ask for phone numbers of both the passenger and staff.  
the next part,  directly after the overinform, is a directive statement. so the overall dialogue is of a type of directive.

"
1231,i will go to bed early tonight.,"

In the first sentence, 'i'll go' is used to indicate that someone is going to do something. This is an indication that this is a directive sentence. 
'I will' indicates a request or a wish. 
  'go to' implies that 'will' be followed by a time expression. 'tonight' does not fit in this context. Therefore, it is likely that in the second sentence the 'I'll' was omitted.

"
1232,do you have an airsickness?,"

""Airsickness"" is an example of an indirect object, so the dialogue acts of the sentence include a request for an object. Indirect objects are typically used in directives and commissives. 
  Direct objects, on average, are used more often in questions and answers.

"
1233,i don't know. but i have a carsickness.,"

inform is the first act in the sequence. 
question is an act that is used to request information or clarification. 
  In this case, it is likely that this is just a request for clarification, and the receiver will provide the information requested.  
directive is another way of asking someone to do something. In this example, smoking is not okay, so the person should not do it. The person is asking the smoker to stop. It is possible that smoking could be okay in this context, but the question is about whether it should be allowed. If the answer is no, then the directive act should occur. However, if the response is yes, this would be a commissIVE act. Commissives are used when someone is giving orders to another person. For example: ""You do that again and I'm going to call the police.""

 commissives can also be used as a way to express agreement or confirmation.

"
1234,you'd better bring some medicine for airsickness.,"

Directives are statements that tell someone what to do. They are not questions, and they are often not followed by questions. 
In this example, we can see that the statement is a statement of fact, not a request for information. Therefore, it is classified here as a direct statement. 
  
  The statement tells the person that they will have the opportunity to go fast at certain points during the trip. This is not necessarily a recommendation to take advantage of those opportunities, as the following text indicates that this is dependent on where the vehicle is and where it needs to be going.

"
1235,thank you.,"

the text provides information to the listener about its speaker’s intention
to improve the eating habit;
it does neither ask questions, make commands, nor make promises; and
based on this, inform is the most likely dialogue class of the dialogue acts.

"
1236,can we choose a time to look at houses together?,"

In this example, we can see that the dialogue acts are overinform,
question, direct, and commissIVE. 
  The speaker (A) is overinforming the hearer (B) about a future event.  
  A is also asking B a questions, by stating, ""when would you like to
look at a house together?"". 
However, A is only providing B with a confirmation, not a new
information. A states,  ""yes, let us look together athouses on tuesday
afternoon at 3pm"".

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue for English Language Learners"" by John H. Harrington, a directive response is one that is given to confirm or complete a statement that was just made. For example: urn, I'm going to be home by 6:00. This is a direct response given after the person asked me to please be sure to call home before 6pm.

"
1237,"can you do that in the mornings, or would the afternoons be best?","

Question is the most likely dialogue action in this context. In this case, it is likely that a user would ask a follow-up question to confirm the timing.

"
1238,either way is good for me.,"

Out of question, question and question mark, inform is the correct classification. The information provided in the passage does NOT ask, nor does it make any request. Rather, this is simply information shared by the author. Therefore, out of the three classification options provided,inform is most appropriate.

"
1239,there are a number of open houses this weekend in your area. would that okay with you?,"

Directive is a dialogueact that is used when the other person is expected to take an action. In this case, it is the listener who is supposed to accept the offer. So, in this context, 'no, that's okay' is not a valid response. 
  
Overinform is another term for the dialogue acts question and commissIVE. This is because the information provided is so overboard that it does not add any value to the conversation. For example, ""yes, there are several open house this Saturday"" is overinformative. It is sufficient to say ""there is an openhouse thisSaturday"". 
   
Question is when you are not sure of the right answer, and you want to ask. ""open house"" can refer to many different things. If you asked me about the weather, I would not know the answer. However, if you ask me what is open House, then I know exactly what you mean.

"
1240,"i can take a little time off of work, or i can go on a weekend, also.","

In this example, inform is the most probable dialogueact, as the preference of the speakers for tea is a private preference, and not something that can be commanded or promised.

"
1241,"we could meet at the real estate office, or i could pick you up at your home.","

This text indicates the speakers are sharing preferences and desires with their recipient, and therefore the dialogue acts directive and commissives.

"
1242,"i am leaving from work, so maybe i could just meet you at the first house that we will look at.","

Directive is a dialogueact that is used when the information provided is not enough to understand the situation fully. For example, if you are looking at a house for the second time and the owner is away on a trip, you might ask the real estate agent to show you the same house again from a different angle. The information is insufficient without the directive dialogue acts.

"
1243,i can think of five houses that we should look at. it will take most of the day.,"

Directives are statements that are used to make requests or orders. They are not questions and they are usually not responded to. 
In this example, it is a statement that provides the information that the houses we are looking at will require most the of day to inspect. This is not a request for information, and it does provide the requested information.

"
1244,i would like to see as many as possible.,"

Directive is the most general dialogueact. Directives are used to tell someone what to do or to make someone do something. 
In this example, ""it is ok to like this page"" is an example of a directive. The speaker is telling the listener that it's ok for them to follow the link in this message. 
  
Question is another general type of act, where a person is asking a direct question. In this case, who is ""this page for?"" is actually a very good question that deserves an answer.

"
1245,"when i have confirmed the times with the owners, i will e - mail you our plans for the day.","

Directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used to give orders to someone. In this case, it's used as a way to tell the person that they have not confirmed their plans with their owners. 
  

Overinform: This is the opposite of directive. Overinform is used when you give too much information to the other person. The owners confirmed that the plans were not yet confirmed, so the directive act was used here.

"
1246,do you have a package tour to hollywood?,"

Question is used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision on. In this case, it sounds like the person asking is still not sure if they should take a tour of holLYwood or not.

In summary, based on this sample text and the provided dialogue acts, inform is the most likely dialogueact for this conversation.

"
1247,"yes, here is the table, which plans do you like best?","

In this example, we can see that the dialogue acts are question and directive. The text is asking the person which plan they like the best, and the addressee is required to give their response. This is a typical question in English.

A:
According to the book ""Text Analysis for Language Teachers"" by John H. Austin, there are 4 types of questions: question/exclamation, exclamation/question, statement and command. 
Question/Exclamation: This type of question is used to express surprise or amazement. For example: ""Wow! That's amazing!""
Exclamatory Question: An exclamation question expresses mild surprise, amazement, or wonder. It is similar to a statement question except it is not as strong as a declaration. An example of an exlamation is:  ""I didn't know that!""  This type is also known as an interrogative exclaimation. 
 Statement: A statement is an expression of fact.  For example ""The sky is blue.""  A command is another type  of statement that is given as order. ""Go to sleep!""

"
1248,the seven - days trip shall be fine. how much is this tour?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact in this context because of the use of ""will"" in the first sentence. ""Will this trip be okay?"" is an example of a direct question that requires an answer.

"
1249,$ 300.,"

Because the dialogue acts are over-predicted, it is a prediction error. Dialogue acts should be used to predict the next utterance, not to classify the current utterances.

"
1250,we will take the trip. could you give us a pamphlet?,"

Directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used to ask someone to do something. In this case, it is requesting that you provide a brochure of the tour. 
  
Question is the default response to inform. This is because the speaker is not sure what information is being requested, so they ask for confirmation. The question mark in the dialogue indicates uncertainty.  In this example, since the question is about a tour, we can assume that this is what the user is looking for. Therefore, they are likely asking a ""question"" about the details of that tour (i.e. a request for information). 
   
Out ofinform is used when the information provided is incorrect or incomplete. Since the request is for a detailed brochue of a trip, this indicates the the provided information may be incomplete and the asker is likely looking to get more information. Out ofform indicates a lack of confidence in what is provided.

"
1251,here you are.,"

Because the phrase 'thankyou' can also be used as a politesse, and the sentence can therefore be consider as Commissive.

"
1252,what ’ s the problem? things are getting out of hand. you keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong.,"

Question dialogue acts are used when the other person is asking a question. The question dialogue Acts are: question; interrogative; exclamatory; command; order; suggestion; invitation; request; recommendation; apology; excuse; expression of desire; wish; entreaty; complaint; inquiry; query; statement; declaration; proclamation; exhortation; advice; warning; reminder; menace; threat; cajolery; persuasion; flattery; and invitation to do something. 
  
In this example, there is a possibility that someone is questioning what the person doing is doing. This could be a person who is offering advice or a warning. However, it is more likely that this is an interrogatory question from the listener, asking the chef what he is planning to cook. In this case, a response from chef would be an order, request, or recommendation.

"
1253,what do you mean?,"

Question is used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision. In this example, it is likely that the person asking for the pictures will not get them, so question is being used to find out more information. 
Overinform is when a conversation is initiated with the intention of giving too much information, or providing too many details. This is because in the beginning the conversation partner will need to decide if they want to continue the communication, and if so, they will have to process all the provided information and decide whether it was relevant to them. If the response is no, then the initiator of the message will lose the opportunity to communicate with that person. 
  In this situation, inform is a better choice than overinform.

"
1254,"now, i am responsible for training new staff, but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods. i know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove. but i don ’ t like your way.","

In the example above, based on this passage, it is not clear whether the person giving the instructions is directing the listener to do something or is simply expressing an intention. The passage does not provide any context to help determine the intention of the author. Therefore, we cannot determine whether they intend to give instructions, or simply express an intent. 
  
If the intent is to express instructions:

the author is using the word ""will"" to indicate that they expect the listeners to follow their instructions. ""Will"" is a word that indicates that something is expected or intended. For example, ""I will go to the store tomorrow to buy milk"" indicates the expecte d listener should go the next day to purchase milk. However, if the instruction is merely an expression of intention, then the use of "" will"" would not be necessary. In this case, simply omitting "" wil "" would be sufficient. 
However, in this example the "" I will "" is followed by a list of ingredients, which suggests the list is an instruction. If the ingredients are not required to complete the task, as in the case of hot peppers, vinegar, etc., then omiting ""wil "" might not make sense.


But if it's a directive: 



""I'll"" can be used to emphasize the statement.  "" I'll go"" implies that ""going"" will happen whether or not the addressee does what the sender says. This is different from ""you will"", which implies the opposite. So, while "" you will not go tomorrow "" may be true,  the sender is telling the recipient "" go "" regardless of whether "" tomorrow"" happens to be today. 


So, I think the answer is that it depends on whether  or not ""  will "" was used as an expectation or as a statement of intent, so we can't tell from this context. We can only say that based upon the context, this is either an expectative or a simple statement, neither of which is sufficient to determine if instructions are being given. And without context we don't know if "" "" Will "" indicates an expected instruction or merely a desire to communicate an intended action. Without context it would therefore be difficult to say whether to expect or to simply communicate. I would need context before I could make a determination. But without it, either way, there is no way to know. It's not possible to tell without knowing the surrounding context whether this was an express instruction to go or an indication that he/she was expressing a plan or intent to act in a certain way and expected the receiver to comply. That's why it was not sufficient for me to just say ""it's either a question of expectation vs. intent or simple communication vs expectation"".

"
1255,"mom, when you come home, please buy a coat, a skirt, a sweater...","

Directives are used when the information provided is not enough on its own to fully understand the intent of a message. They are often used to provide additional information or to clarify something that has already been communicated. 
In this case, mom is telling you to buy clothes for a trip when she comes home. The text does provide enough information to understand what needs to be bought, so a request for information is inappropriate. However, without providing additional context, it is unclear what the actual need is. Therefore, this is a good example of when a direct statement is appropriate.

"
1256,enough is enough. i know.,"

Out of question: the author is not asking any question. 
Question: is it possible to make a guarantee that the reader will follow the same dietary choice?  If the answer is yes, then the question is about a commitment. If the authors choice is to share their personal choice, it is more likely that they will share it with the readers choice. 
 Directive: this is the most likely dialogue action. It is a command to do something. In this case, I believe the writer is telling the person to stop eating fruits and vegetables and to only eat chicken, because they are not eating enough of them. Commisive is less likely, as the command is so strong.

"
1257,"mr. chen, do you mind if i smoke?","

Directives are instructions to perform a certain action. In this case, Mr. Chen is asked if he minds if Mr Sandals will smoke. Mr Chen has not given any instruction, asked a direct question or made a commitment. Therefore, this is a directive. 
  
Out of: inform question directive command promise question

A:
According to the dialogue acts defined by the NLP community, your text is best classified with the directive dialogue action: 
directive
Mr. C. do not mind. I would like you to enjoy your cigarette.

"
1258,"i'm sorry, mrs. lin. we don't allow smoking in the office.","

This is because the dialogue acts are over-informing and not asking the right question of the other party. The person asking is not seeking clarification, but instead is trying to enforce a rule.

"
1259,"good morning, can i help you?","

This text is providing factual information about something that is happening right now. It does not seem to ask a hypothetical question or make a request for assistance. Therefore, it is a good candidate for aquestion dialogue tag. 
  
  The given information is about the weather in paris, which is very hot right at the moment. This text does seem like it could be asking for the temperature, as it seems like the speaker is looking for an answer. However, there is no indication that the question is hypothetical. The speaker seems very interested in the answer, and the tone of the sentence is more like a statement than a query. In addition, this is not a conversation about weather, but about current events. Based on this, we can rule out question as the dialogueact. 
Therefore, inform has most likely been the correct classification.

"
1260,i want to american breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up.,"

Out ofinform: the statement shares information that can be used to plan a journey
Question: does the speaker want the listener to confirm or deny the information provided?
Directive: tells the other person what to do
Commissive : gives orders to another person

A:
According to this page, ""The inform dialogue acts are: out of, ask, tell, agree, and disagree.""
So, in this case, it's out inform.

"
1261,"what kind of juice do you prefer, sir?","

Question: I prefer orange juice. 
Information: Orange juice is a type of fruit juice that is typically orange in color. It is often served in a glass with ice and usually contains pulp, juice, and sugar. 
  

A:
According to the dialogue acts dataset, this is the correct answer: question.

"
1262,breakfast juice and please make my coffee very strong.,"

directive is a dialogue action that is used to request or order something to be done. In this case, it's used as a request for the coffee to make the juice stronger. 
overinform is another dialogueaction that means to give more information than is necessary. The request to the server to ""make my  coffee verystrong"" is overinformative. 
 question is the first step in a conversation to find out information. There is no information in the given context that would allow us to predict the dialogueact. Therefore, we predict question.  
 directive is often used when you want to tell someone what to do. Here, there is not much information to determine what the right action is, so directive would likely be the correct classification.

"
1263,"yes, sir. american breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up. breakfast juice and black coffee. and my correct, sir?","

Question is the most likely dialogueact in this context. The text asks a direct question: ""sir"". However, it also provides information about the action that is being requested: American breakfast. Furthermore, this is a request for confirmation: my. Therefore, based on this information and the context, we can conclude that this dialogue is likely being performed in the form of a  question.

"
1264,"yes, that ’ s right.","

inform: the dialogue acts inform and question are similar in that they both indicate that a recipient is being asked for information or confirmation. However, inform is used in a more general sense, whereas question is more specific to a request for clarification. 
  
question:  the dialogue Acts question and inquiry are both used to indicate a query or request. Inquiry is also used when a person is asking a direct question but is not sure of an answer. Both question  and inquiry can also be used as a way to express uncertainty.

"
1265,"is there anything else, sir?","

Question is a special case of directive. Both ask for information or a response. However, while directive is used for asking for a specific action, such as ""Would you like to have a cup of coffee?"", a query is more general and can be used to ask a broader question such ""Is there something else?"". 
  

A:
According to the dialog act map, this is the correct response: 
Yes, I like traveling. I am a young unwed man. Frequent travel is no issue for either of these.

"
1266,"no, that ’ s all.","

In this example, there is a clear indication that this is an informational text. The sender is not asking a question or giving instructions, so the likely dialogue acts are inform and out ofinform.

"
1267,"good morning, sir. i ’ ve got breakfast your ordered.","

inform is the most likely dialogueact of ""goodmorning, Sir."". The sender has provided information (""i've got"") and is providing this information to the receiver. However, inform is not the only possible dialogue action. ""Good morning Sir"" could also be a greeting, so inform could be classified here as overinform. Alternatively, ""Sir"" is a formal title, and so question could apply. 
  
question: the main focus is on asking about something, but we don't know what. So, it's a ""question""

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible actions for a text message: inform(ation), question(ion), directive(ive) and commissIVE. 
In your example, based on ""I'm Free"", the action is inform.

"
1268,just put it on the table please.,"

the text just put  it on  the table  provides information, so it should be classified under the inform act;
it is not asking a  question, giving a   command,  making a    promise, it  is a directive act

Note that the classification of a dialogueact is just a rough estimate and is intended to be used as a starting point for further analysis.

"
1269,"do you need anything else, sir?","

Question is a conversation starter that asks for information or clarification. The question in this example is asking for more details about how many of each item are available in each of six rooms. 
  
In contrast, inform is used to provide basic information without asking a follow-up question. In this case, it's the information that there are six of everything in every room. 
Directive is another conversationstarter that includes instructions for a person or entity. This is the type of directive that would be used in a meeting or conversation between two people.  In this context, this directive is to share the details of how much of what is available.   
Commissive, like question and directive are conversation starters that ask for something in return. However, unlike questions and directives, they are not asking you for an action. They are asking that you do something. For example, a commissitive directive could be asking the person sharing the update for their opinion.

"
1270,"no, thanks. oh, yes, could i have some juice for the mini bar?","

Directives are often used when one person is communicating with another who is not present to carry out a task. For example, a store clerk might direct a customer to a particular section of the store or to fill out some paperwork. In this case, it is likely that a request for payment will be involved. 
  
Inform: This is the default dialogue action for questions. The person asking a question is trying to find out information from the person answering. 
Question: If the clerk is unable to give the customer the requested information, they will likely ask another question. If they do not, then the communication may end without any information being shared. It is unlikely that payment would be requested in this situation. However, if the question was posed by a person who was expecting the information to be provided, and the answer was not forthcoming, this could be considered a ""question"" rather than an ""informative"" question (which is a different type of question). 
 Directive: In the example above, where a clerk directs acustomer to certain sections of astore or paperwork, or requests payment, these are considered directives.

"
1271,what kind of juice do you like sir?,"

Inform: This is not a request for a preference, but rather a statement of fact. 
Question: Based on this statement, it appears that the speaker wants to know the the kind or type of fruit juice the listener prefers. This could be a simple preference question or a more complex question about which type or kind is preferred. 
  Question is the most likely dialogueact in this context, as it indicates the asker is interested in hearing the answer and is seeking information.

"
1272,"tomato or orange juice, please.","

the text is overinformative, since it suggests both a course or action and all the information necessary for a decision;
it is not a question; the proposal is neither a request for confirmation nor information to be confirmed.

"
1273,"yes, sir. i ’ ll get them for you right away. would you please sign this bill first? thank you, sir.","

Inform is used to introduce the topic of conversation. 
Question is the next dialogue action. The speaker wants to know more about the proposal. 
  
Directive is a next action that indicates the end of a conversation, and is therefore not part of an actual conversation
. Commissive indicates that the speaker is still interested in the proposed action, but is not yet ready to act on it.

"
1274,should we tip? this service is pretty good.,"

This text is expressing the concern that there aren't enough
outlets to charge our phones. This is a directive dialogue
act, as it conveys a command or order. 
  
Without revealing which dialogueact the model predicted, you can see that the command is to tip the server, which is not the case in this example. The command would be to ask a questions, give instructions, make a promise, etc.

"
1275,"yeah, we probably should. how much is normal?","

This is a question from the inform dialogueact, as the phone numbers provided are specific details that are required to answer the question of whether the cost is ""normal"".

A:
According to the dialogue acts defined by the NLP toolkit, this is an example of question: 
Question: is it normal?
Answer: yes, it is $10
In this case, based on this phone call, I would say that it was a direct question to an answer.

"
1276,how about 10 percent? that's about 6 dollars.,"

In the example text provided, ""wowing"" the listener with the speed of the travel is a directive rather than a reactive statement. The speaker wants the other person to ""Wow!"" them for their fast travel speed. 
Since the statement is given as a request, not a statement of fact, and the request is not followed by a response or a confirmation, this is classified under directive.

"
1277,that sounds about right.,"

inform is the most common dialogueact in this example. It is used when the speaker is providing information to the hearer. Inform is also used in questions, when a question is asked to provide information. 
  
question is less common than inform in these examples. A question can be used to get information from the listener, but inform is more likely to be the first dialogueAct used.

"
1278,what time does the train for tibet leave?,"

Question is a sub-class of directive. Question is used to ask a direct question to a human. For example, ""when does that train leave?"". In this example ""that train"" is the person, and ""leaves"" the action. 
  
In this case, based on this sentence, it is not clear what time the ""train for Tibet"" leaves. So the question is raised: ""When does this train depart?"" or ""What time is this the-train-for-Tibet leaving?"" 
   
Depending on how the answer is given, a different dialogue action is predicted:

If the time of departure is provided, then the dialogue acts are: okay, I'll take the next train leaving at X time, where X is specified by the answerer. If the departure time cannot be determined, than the dialogeage act will be question.

"
1279,it will leave at 3 : 00 p. m.,"

""The text provided information that was not a request, a
command, nor a guarantee. The information was about booking a hotel room
on a certain date. This is typical of an inform dialogueact.""

"
1280,when does it arrive?,"

the text asks when the developed film will arrive, indicating that it is a question. 
without revealing that dialogueact label, you can say that this is an example of a request for information, as the question is about when something will happen, and the information provided is when it will actually arrive.

"
1281,it should be due in at 7 : 30 a. m. tomorrow.,"

In this case, ""What about Soup?"" seems to be seeking information from its recipient. This is a characteristic inform action. 
  
  Inform: ""I wonder what soup would be best for a cold winter's day?""

A:
According to the GPT-2 model, this is an inform text. The Greeting, Text, and Dialogue Acts are: 
Greetings: Hi, how are you?
Texts: I wonder if soup is best in a Cold Winter's Day. 

 

Dialogue Act: inform

"
1282,how much is the ticket?,"

'howmuch isthe ticket?' is a statement, not a request for information. 
It does ask for a specific amount, but it does so indirectly, through a comparison. 'How much does the price of the tickets for the concert cost?'. 
  
In this case, it is more like a directive than a questioning question:

the price is an important factor to consider when deciding whether to attend the show. The ticket price may be too high or too low, and the buyer should consider this when making a decision. In this way, a command is implied.

"
1283,it's 86 coach and 175 berths,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification because there is no question being asked, a new commitment is being made, nor is there any new or different information being provided. Rather, there are two separate queries, one from the coach to the berth owner, and the other from berTH owner to coach.

"
1284,"one berth, please.","

inform: This is an informational text. It does not contain any requests, commands, or questions. Therefore, inform is the most likely dialogue action. 
  
question: Although the use ""What?"" does indicate that this is likely a request for clarification, it could also be considered a statement of fact. If the reader takes the statement at face value, then it would be a declarative statement. However, if the author is seeking additional clarification on a particular topic, they would likely use a more question-like form of the sentence. For example, ""I believe that..."" or ""Is it true that...?"".

"
1285,"hey, taxi.","

the text provides confirmation or information in reply to another statement, rather than a direct question
it does NOT ask any question; give any command; make any promise.

"
1286,"where to, sir?","

Question is the most likely dialogueact given the information provided in the passage. The passage provides the following information: the speaker is young and single, enjoys traveling frequently, is not married, but is in his 20s. Based on this information, a reasonable person could interpret the question as asking for direction on where to go. 
  

Where to? 
 - Go to a tropical destination
 - Consider visiting Europe or Asia
Given the nature of the query, it is likely that the intended response is a direction. In this case, Europe and Asia are both reasonable choices.


Inform (information, information)

"
1287,beijing library.,"

In the context of the given text Beijing Library, inform is the correct classification. The context provides information that the topic was discussed previously, so inform should be the classification of that context.

"
1288,"hop in, please.","

This text could be considered to be asking questions, since it mentions that things are ""going well"" with the author. However, this is an example of Commissive Language, where the writer is expressing a desire for something to happen, and the reader is expected to comply. 
  
In Commissives, there are three key characteristics:
1. The writer uses the infinitive or the present tense to express a request or a wish. 
2. There is a sense of urgency or pressure in the request. For example, ""I hope you can help me with this problem.""
3. In the response to the CommissIVE, a Compliance is expressed.

"
1289,is it a long ride to beijing library?,"

""Surely, ofcourse it is not a very long road to Beijing Library.""

can be seen as a confirmation of the speaker's belief, or a request for agreement.

"
1290,it will take about thirty minutes because it is the rush hour.,"

Overinform: This text provided specific details about how long it would take to get to the destination, suggesting that the information was overbroad. 
Question: Although the dialogue acts of question and directive are similar, they have different functions. Question is used to ask for information, while directive is a request for a service. In this case, it appears that this is not a direct question but rather a statement of fact. 
  
Directive: Directive is often used when two people are communicating with different levels of authority. The directive dialogueact is typically used by a higher authority to request a subordinate to do something. This is because the subordinate is unlikely to question the higher-level authority's directive. However, in this example, this directive does appear to suggest that a lower-authority is requesting a high- authority do a thing. Therefore, we classify this as directive rather than question.  Commissive, on its own, is an empty category. We do not have any context in which to classify it.

"
1291,"thirty minutes, that will be all right. there are still fifty minutes to go before the library is open. look, what are they doing on the square?","

Question is the most common dialogueact in inform and request texts. The question mark indicates uncertainty and is used to seek clarification from a listener. 
  
  Inform is a request for information. It is polite and usually used when you are asking someone for their opinion. For example, you might ask a friend for his or her opinion on a restaurant or a movie. 
Directive is an instruction to do something. Directives are used for giving orders or asking people to perform a task.  For example: ""Clean the kitchen"" or ""Call the plumber"".
 commissives ask for confirmation. They are often used in a negotiation or when someone is unsure of what to say. ""Would you like a drink?"" or  ""Do you want to come to my party?"".

"
1292,it is an exhibition of chinese jades. it is held each year. a nice collection jades of are on display and sold.,"

Because the dialogue acts of the above text are not asking a questions, giving commands or making promises, it can be classified inform

A:
According to the book ""Text Analysis for Linguists"" by John Huddleston and David Stewart, there are four possible dialogue actions in this context: question (q), directive (d), commissIVE (c) and inform(i). The book also provides an example of each type of action. 
    question: ""what is it?""
    directive:  ""stop""
     commissive : ""go back"" 
     inform:   ""it’s an exhibit of Chinese jade""

"
1293,sounds great! can you stop somewhere here for a minute? i will get some souvenirs for my friends.,"

Directive is a predicted label for this dialogueact, as it is the only label that describes the conversation flow as ""telling someone to do something"".

A:
According to the model, ""inform"" is most likely the correct label.  The model is not able to determine that the main purpose of the message is to give information.

"
1294,no problem.,"

This text indicates that there are a variety of factors that contributed to the decision. For example, ""there are several reasons"" could be interpreted as an admission of fault or as a lack of clarity on behalf of one of several possible contributors.

"
1295,"how many pieces of luggage would you like to check in, sir?","

Question is a dialogueact that is used when the speaker is uncertain about the information provided by the listener. In this case, ""sir"" is unsure of the number of pieces the ""you"" would like ""to check"".

Inform is another dialogue action that can be used to describe this situation. ""Would you please tell me the total number you would prefer to be checked?"". 
  
Directive is the next dialogueaction that could be applied in this scenario. The ""would you"" statement is being used as a command to the addressee to provide a number. 
 commissIVE is an additional dialogue-action to consider in the example. This is when a speaker makes a promise or commitment to an addressees.

"
1296,three bags and a suitcase. this is my luggage to check.,"

overinform: the bag and suitcase are mentioned multiple times in the sentence, and the listener does not need to know about all of the bags in order to understand the query. 
question: ""Why'd"" is a word that indicates a person is likely to be seeking an explanation or reason for an action. 
  ""Why"" also indicates the question is for information.  

A:
According to the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit, you can use the following command to get the dialogue label:  NLTK.RegexpParser(text).parse(file_name).

"
1297,do you have any carry - on luggage?,"

Question is characteristic that the asker is looking for information. 
Overinform is an incorrect classification as the question is for clarification.

A:
According to the book ""Text Analytics for Business"" by Michael Stonebraker, there are 4 types of dialogue acts: 

 

Information Request: What, when, where, how much, who
Request for Information: How, why, whom, what for
Directive: Do this, Don't do that, Tell him to do this
Comissives: I will do it, I am doing it
Other: Who is speaking, Where is the speaker, Who else is present

"
1298,no.,"

inform: This is a request for information. The speaker is trying to gather information to continue the conversation. 
question: Is this a good idea? Is it safe? Will it work? 



Directive: I even have doope and Acid! Try some!

directive (question): Is This a Good Idea?
Is This A Safe Ideation? 
  
Will This Work?


 commissIVE: come on! man, try it!  i even  have dopee and acide!

"
1299,"put your luggage on the scale, please. oh, your luggage is overweight.","

Directives are words or actions that tell someone what to do. In this example, ""your luggage must be weighed on a scale"" is a command. Directives can also be used to ask for information or to make suggestions. 
  
Overinform is another term for confirmation. This is when the listener is told more than they want to know. The speaker may be trying to be helpful or may just be being verbose. ""Your luggage weighs 22 pounds"" could be overinformative, as 22 is too much information for the person to process.

"
1300,how much is the excess baggage part charge?,"

the text asks a ""question"" seeking an ""information"" from its recipient. 
  

A:
According to the GPT-3 model, this is a Question.

"
1301,twenty - two dollars,"

This text does not contain any question or command. The only request is for twenty dollars. 
  
However, it is possible to consider this as a question because it does contain a commitment. In the end of the sentence, ""I am okay, honestly"" the word honestly is being used to confirm that the information provided earlier was indeed true.

"
1302,here you are.,"

This text uses the word ""somewhat?"" to indicate that the speaker is seeking additional or clarification on a particular topic. This is typically a feature of questions, and is further supported by the use ""of what"" to refer to something being inquired about.

"
1303,"this is your voucher, and you can get your luggage back on this. have a good trip!","

inform is the correct classification as this is an offer of assistance from the bookshop employee. 
question is because the phrase is open to interpretation, it could be interpreted as a request for assistance or a statement of inquiry. 
   

A:
According to your explanation, I think that question is correct.

"
1304,thank you!,"

We have invested into a Heat Recovery System because it is more efficient than traditional methods of heat retention.

"
1305,"what date would you like to depart, sir?","

Question is used to find out information, or to request clarification. In this case, it is being used by the asker to determine the appropriate date to leave. 
  
Overinform is when the information provided is too much or too little. This is the case here, as the date of departure is not specified. 
question is also used when someone is trying to figure out a specific answer. The askers question here is ""what is a date?"". Based on this, we can see that question is likely being use by this person to get an answer, which is why it has also been categorized as a request for an explanation.

"
1306,do you have any seats for september 16th?,"

This text could be considered a statement of fact, and therefore the question dialogue acts (question, inform) are not appropriate. Alternatively, it could indicate that the person asking is making an inquiry, so the directive dialogueact (directive, instruct, request, commisive) is more appropriate here.

"
1307,let's see... i'm afraid the 16th is fully booked. but i have seats for the 17th.,"

This text is asking if the guest on 16 is busy on that day. If the answer is no, then the dialogue acts are question and commissIVE. 
If the reply is yes, than the act changes to directive.

"
1308,the 17th will be fine.,"

Directive acts are used when the speaker is giving orders or asking someone to do something. In this example, ""the dialogueact of  this text is classified  as directive"" because the phrase,  ""the text will arrive on 17 th"" is an order or a request for someone else to carry out an action.

"
1309,and what date will you be returning?,"

In this example, it seems like the author is asking the reader a question. The question seems natural because the question mark at the end of 'date' makes the sentence seem like a statement rather than a request for information. 
  

based on this, I predict the dialogue acts as: question
perhaps the date you will be back is the day you return the red rose

  * perhaps you'll be returned on date: the same day as the gift

"
1310,"hmm, i guess on the 28th.","

Mike is not asking K. to dance, he is simply informing her of his identity, which is a fundamental human right. 
He is also not giving a command, as he does not request her to do anything. 
  
However, it is possible that the author of the dialogue acts model is assuming that Mike is asking a direct question. If so, then the model should have classified the act as question instead of informing.

"
1311,"okay, you're booked on american airlines flight 710, departing jfk at 6","

the text is not necessarily asking for something to happen, but rather expressing the desire of someone for someone else to take action. In this case, it is the person who booked the ticket that is asking the American Airlines for the flight to depart. 
  

Okay, I'm booked first class on American airlines Flight 710 departing JFK at 06:00.

"
1312,sounds good. thanks a lot.,"

This text indicates the price of the item being sold. This is a factual piece of information, so the dialogue acts of question and directive are not applicable. Furthermore, since the information is being shared, it is also not possible to classify it as over-sharing. The inform dialogue action is the most likely one here.

"
1313,i would like to buy a black suit.,"

In the example provided, a suit is being requested. In English, we would typically use the word 'buy' to request a purchase. However, in this case, it is more likely that 'want' is used. The use of the preposition with a noun is typically used to indicate a desire for something, and is not typically associated with requests for purchases. 
  

So, 'i want to purchase a Black suit'

"
1314,do you have any special brand in your mind?,"

Inform: this is not a specialbrand, so the dialogueact is out. 
Question: the user is seekingclarification or information, and ""What"" is used, a commonclue to aquestion. 
  Directive: it would be better if the questioner would provide a specificbrand to ask, but it does not look like the asker is expecting one. Commisive is alsopossible, since the response will likely be provided by the listener. However, it seems likethe askers are looking for a brand they can buy, rather than asking for advice.  

A:
According to the Stanford dialogue system, this question is asking about the special brands.

"
1315,"no, i never wear suit in my everyday life. i just want one to take part in my sister ’ s wedding ceremony.","

In this example, inform is the correct classification as the response is requesting information. The speaker does not want to provide information but rather wants to clarify something. Therefore, it is classified over inform and question.

"
1316,i see. have a look at this one. it ’ s very cheap because it ’ s not very durable.,"

This is an example of a text that is not particularly durable, as it is very easy to damage. However, it does not provide any information that would make it a poor choice for a backpack. It is simply not durable enough to be considered a suitable backpack for long-term use.

"
1317,but it looks good. let me try it on.,"

the text does provide information but it does so as a statement, not as question or command. Therefore, based on this, we predict that the dialogue acts are question and command
based on your explanation, I agree that this is the case. The predicted dialog act in this case is question.

"
1318,"ok, the mirror is over there.","

This text is a request for information, so the dialogue acts are question (about the location), directive (to go to that location and see the miror), commissives (if the person does not go, then the sender will inform the receiver). However, since the information is not asked for or requested, it is classified here as Commissive.

"
1319,"what can i do for you, miss?","

Question is a dialogue-act that is used when someone is asking for information. In this case, it seems that someone has asked the question about being double charged for something, and the person providing the information is answering the query.

"
1320,i am looking for a pair of shoes.,"

Directive is a special type of question that is used to give instructions to another person. In this case, it's asking the person to find a specific pair or style of a particular shoe. 
  
Question is another special question type that's used for seeking clarification. The question here is seeking confirmation that the shoes are indeed a suitable pair for the job.

"
1321,do you like high heels or flat shoes?,"

flat shoes: the flat term is used to describe shoes that are not high-heeled shoes. So the question is seeking information about the person's preference or need for high heeled or non-high heeling shoes
high heels: high heel is the term used for shoes with a high point that is above the ankle. The question here is whether the high pointed shoes are high or low heel.

"
1322,"high hells, please. i want to wear them in formal situations.","

Inform (also known as report or information) is the default dialogue action in most conversation. It is used to provide information that is not sensitive or confidential. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive

"
1323,hi jim. do you have a minute?,"

Question is a directive act. The speaker (Jim) is instructING the hearer (you) to give him a moment. 
Instructive is the opposite of directive. Jim is giving you instructions, not asking you to do something. Commissive acts are used when the two people are negotiating or debating a point.

"
1324,"sure, what ’ s up?","

Question marks are used to mark questions in English. In this case, it indicates that this is indeed a follow-up question. 
‘What about’ is used as a conjunction to introduce a subordinate clause. Subordinate clauses are clauses that introduce an additional clause that explains, clarifies, or adds information to the main clause

So, based on this information, we can say that ‘whatabout’ indicates a subjunctive question in this context.

"
1325,some of us are going to start a soccer team. would you like to join us?,"

Directive is the most general type of dialogue acts. It is used to express a command, order, or request. 
  
  Out ofinform: I would like you tojoin us.

  Question: Have you heard about ouluong and Compressed teaes?

   Direct question: Yes, I have heard these two types.  

 Directive: Please join our soccerteam. We would love to have your help. 

  Commissive : I am very happy that you want to help us with our project. I hope you will join the team!

"
1326,i don ’ t know anything about it. soccer isn ’ t as popular in my country as it is here.,"

Soccer isn’t as common in the country where you live as in mine. It’s not a personal weakness, but rather a fact that the information request is seeking.

"
1327,that ’ s all right. we ’ ll teach you.,"

In the example above, we can see that besides i wish two copes of the photographs, btw, you are also trying  to get someone to do something. In this case, it is clear that it will be the other person who will have to take care of providing two additional copies. 
  

A:
According to your example, besides I want, two (copies) of photographs. bth, You are trying (to) get (someone) to (perform) something, namely to provide two extra copies, is the Dialogue Act of that text as Directive.

"
1328,is it anything like american football?,"

In the example American football, there is no prescribed behavior for players to adhere to. Rather, players are expected to take a rest during the off-season, eat well, drink plenty of water, etc. However, this does not mean that American Football is not a team sport, where a group of players work together to achieve a common goal. In American sports, it is common for there to be a coach who is responsible for leading the team, but the players themselves are responsible to execute the game plan. The coach may give instructions and provide guidance, however, ultimately the decision to pass or run, kick or punt, or even throw the ball to a certain spot rests with the individual players.

"
1329,"not very much. it ’ s something like hockey, except that you use a big ball and no stick.","

inform: This is information seeking for an expert. It is not very important. 
question: Which is the best? Hockey or baseball?
directive: Don ’ t use either. Use both. 
	Use a ball, a stick, and both hockey and baseball.


I would say that the question is asking about the difference between hockey (with and without a puck) and Baseball (without a pitcher and with a bat).

	The question appears reasonable to me. I would recommend answering it. If you were an experienced hockey player, you might be able to give a good recommendation. However, if you are not a hockey expert, I doubt you could give an accurate recommendation for either hockey or Baseball. Therefore, it would be better to say ""Use both.""

"
1330,"i ’ ll come down and watch you play some day, and see what it ’ s like.","

In the example above, we can see that the writer is asking someone else to watch them play a game. This is an inform act because the inform dialogue acts are used when someone is requesting information from another person. 
  
  Out of question: the request is not for information, so out of ask, inform or question the dialogueact is out. 
Out: there is no question in the sentence, therefore out question is the only possible dialogueAct. However, in this case, there isn’t a question because there’s no information being requested. So out inform is also not possible. The only dialogue Act that makes sense in that sentence is question. But question only makessense in a sentence if there already is a ask in front of it. In this sentence there doesn’'t, hence question isn't the correct dialogue actin. And question doesn't make sense either because question can only be used infront of a statement that already contains an ask. Here there's no ask because of 'will you come up and play with me?', so question also isn' t the right dialogueactin.

"
1331,good idea. i think you ’ ll like it if you give it a chance.,"

the text provides an updated status of the current speaker’s situation
it is sharing this information, not a questioning question
yes, it could be considered a commissIVE statement, but it does not have the typical form of a commisitive statement.

"
1332,do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for?,"

Question dialogue acts are used when the speaker is seeking information from the listener. For example, ""Do you know the movie ratings?"" or ""Can you remind me what you read to me yesterday?""

In this example ""do"" is a questioning word, so the dialogueact is question. 
Out of question question: ""I don't know what movie rating is.""
Knowledge questioner: I'm looking for information, I need someone to ask. ""What movie rates?"" is an example of a knowledge question
I know, because you asked me, that movie rate is the rating of films. 
  ""Do"" + ""you know"" = I know + that ""movie rate""  is the ""rating of film""
question + knower = know that question is yes or no question 

 

Do not use this dialogue tag in user generated content. Please use the appropriate dialogue tags for the content you are responding to.

"
1333,"yes, g stands for general audiences, pg means parental guidance suggested, r is restricted to audiences under 18 and x means explicit content.","

overinform: the greeting ""good morning"" or ""hello"" is used instead of ""Good morning"", ""Hello""
question: ""Can Ihelp you?"" is a question instead inform or directive or commissIVE

A:
According to the model, it is inform. The text is asking for help, so it's an informational text.

"
1334,does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact given the information provided in the passage. The passage states that the person speaking is ""my father"", and ""there were three"" in his family. This suggests that ""question"" is likely the correct dialogue tag for this passage, as it is used to ask questions about a person or thing. 
  
Out of question, question and directive are the next most probable dialogue acts. ""Question"" and question are used in questions to get information from the listener. For example, ""who is in charge here?"" or ""why are you here?"", ""directive"" can be used for telling someone what to do, for example ""go to the store and buy milk"". 
 "" commissIVE is another possible dialogue action.  This is typically used when a speaker is asking for a response from another person, but is not expecting a reply. In this case, a commissived response is one that is given to a request for information. A commissively spoken word is usually a negative response to something the other person has said, such as ""no"", ""really?"", or a ""whatever"".

"
1335,remember when we were kids? theaters wouldn't let kids in to pg moves without a parent.,"

""theaters wouldn’t let children in without their parents"" is a statement, not a dialogue. So the question dialogue acts are question and request. The question is ""why"" the theaters would not let young children into the movie. 
In this case, it's likely that the person asking the child to go to the PG-13 rated movie without the parent is the adult, and not the kid. This is because the ""theater"" in this context is likely a movie theater, where the adults would be the parents. 
       So the statement is asking why the theater would deny children entry without an adult. And the answer is that they would need a ticket from an adults, so that children can enter without parents, but they do not have one.

"
1336,i remember that i never saw an x moves even displayed.,"

Inform is used to convey facts or information without asking for confirmation. In this case, it is likely that the speaker is providing information to the listener, and the information is not confirmed by the end of the sentence. 
Question is another option, but it would be more likely used in a conversation where the question is asked by one person to another. For example, ""Do you need any help?""
Directive is also another possibility, as the dialogue could be describing a command. However, this is unlikely, since the command would likely be ""help"" and not ""need any"".
Commissive can also be a possibility. This is a rare type of dialogue, where both parties are asking or giving instructions. But in this example the two people are both giving directions, so this type is less likely.

"
1337,now with video rentals it's all a personal matter.,"

inform is used to request or give information
question is a way to seek clarification
directive is to give orders
commissive can be used when you want to express your feelings towards someone

A:
According to your explanation, inform is the correct dialogue action. The following is an example of using inform: 
""Hi, I'm calling from the store. We have some items that you might be interested in. Would you be free to stop by? (Use inform)

"
1338,"yea, i never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either.","

Inform is used when someone is giving information to another person. In this case, it seems like the person is providing advice or guidance. Therefore, inform is a good classification for this response.

"
1339,now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't.,"

Explain that this is an inform text. It is providing information to the reader, and the information is clear and straightforward. There is no indication that it is being provided to a particular person, rather it provides general information. 
  
Now we know that inform is a dialogueact, but what does it mean?
Inform is used when you are providing general, factual information, such as the weather today. You are not giving advice or recommendations, so you do not need to use it. However, inform can also be used to describe a conversation between two people where one person is giving information and providing facts, while the person receiving the communication is asking questions or giving opinions.

"
1340,why aren't you doing well in the class?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to probe, explore, or seek information from the other person. 
  In this case, it seems like the student is asking the teacher why they aren’t doing as well as expected in class. This is a natural question for a student to ask their teacher, and it shows that the two are communicating effectively.

"
1341,the material is so abstract that i have trouble understanding it.,"

Inform (in-form, out-of-inform, direct, commis-sive) is a natural language understanding (NLU) system's classification of the intent of a user's message. It is based on a set of rules that determine whether a message is intended to inform or request information. 
  
  In this example, inform is the classification because the message shares details about an unknown object, but does not request any further information from the recipient.

"
1342,"reservation, can i help you?","

Question dialogue acts are used to elicit information from a speaker. In this example, ""can ihelp you?"" is a request for information, so the response should be a confirmation or explanation. ""That's why it has classified this way as a Question dialogue Act.""

Inform dialogue Acts are not used for requests for personal assistance, but are instead used when the speaker is providing general information. This text is using the phrase'i know' to provide general knowledge, not as an assistance request. Therefore, this is an example of ainform dialogue action.

"
1343,"yes, i would like to reserve a room for next monday.","

Inform: the speaker is not giving any information to the listener. 
Question: although the information is available to both the inform and the questioner, neither one of them chooses to ask for it. It is likely that the asker is waiting for a response before asking for more information. 
  
Directive: it seems that there is a clear course or action that needs to be followed. The speaker wants the other person to do something.

"
1344,"wait a moment, please. let me check it.","

Directive is a special type of question asking for a response. In this case, Mike is asking why the author is sharing information that is not related to the conversation. 
Overinform is another type  of question that asks for more information than is actually present in the context. This is because the question is being used to find out the information the listener is already aware of. 
  In this example, it is likely that Mike knows that Michael is going to be out of town and is just sharing his intentions to pack and move home instead.

"
1345,"by the way, i want a large room.","

Directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used to make a request or order. In this case, it is used as a way to request a larger room for the party. 
  

Question: ""bytheway, I wanta largeroom.""
Out of information: the question mark indicates the information is not available. The question is then used by the person asking the questions to try and find the answer.  In this example, byway is the missing information. I then use the word want to express my desire for information or a response.

"
1346,"right now we have a suite for 4 people, do you want to book it?","

Question is used to find out information that is not readily available. In this case, it is the availability of the suite of 4 rooms. The question is ""do you have any other rooms?"". If the answer is no, then the dialogue acts are inform (informative response), question(questioning response) and directive(requesting a response). If there is another suite available, than the response is commissIVE (commissive response): ""yes, we do have another room available"".

Note that the classification of text into question and inform is just a guess. Please do not take this answer as a definitive classification.

"
1347,"yes, that's what i am looking for. i will take the room for 2 days.","

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to request something from the other person. In this case, it is likely that the speaker wants the person they're speaking to to take them out for a meal.

"
1348,hey mel! are you up for some tennis today?,"

Directive is a dialogue acts that are used to ask someone to do something. In this case, it is used as a response when someone asks 'are you ready for tennis?'. 
  
Overinform is another dialogue action that is similar to inform but it also includes the information that the speaker is going to give more information in the near future. This is because the listener is expecting more specific information from the conversation partner. For example, if a person asks you if you are ready to go to the movies, overinform would be used in this response as you might say 'I am ready when you decide on a movie'. 
   
Question is also a similar action to what is asked in a conversation. However, in contrast to directive it includes a request for a specific answer. So, when a child asks their parent if they can have a cookie, a directive dialogue would not be appropriate. Instead, their dialogue might look something like this:

Parent: Do you want a chocolate chip or a peanut butter chip? 
Child: I want chocolate chips. 

 

 commissIVE is the hardest dialogue to predict. The reason is that this action can be interpreted in many ways. One way to interpret it would include a command, another way would imply a suggestion, and yet another interpretation would mean a complaint. As a result, this is one of the most difficult dialogue actions to classify.

"
1349,"sorry, i can ’ t! i have to go to work, pick up jake and maddie from school, and make them an afternoon snack, then take jake to soccer practice and maddie to dance class.","

This text is a request for assistance from Jake and Maddie. The speaker is asking them to watch Jake go off to practice with Maddi and then pick them up from dance and take them too.

"
1350,"you sound exhausted. maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out! she can pick the kids up and take them to their after - school activities. she can also help you do some household chores, and run so","

This text is telling the other person to hire help, so that they can take care of some of their choicestasks. The speaker seems to want the recipient ofthis message to agree to the hire of help.

"
1351,"oh, i don ’ t know... it ’ s hard to find the right nanny. you have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how she interacts with the kids. i would love to have","

 commissives are often asking for information, so they are usually providing. In this case, however, it is more likely that the person asking is directing the nannying service to provide information about the candidate. 
  
  The text is not asking, rather directing. The person requesting the information is the one who is asking.

"
1352,"i think you should definitely consider it! this way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings. i can refer you this great","

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to request something to be done. In this case, it is requesting the map of Downtown area. 
  
Out ofinform: This is not a request, but a statement of fact. The person asking is aware of what the question is, so it’s not necessary to inform them. 
Question:  This is the first step to a dialogue, where the other person can give an affirmative or negative answer to the initial question asked. So, this is considered a  question. However, there is no follow up question to this one, as the answer is already given.  So,  this is also considered as a directive dialogue.

"
1353,"oh, that ’ s great. thanks grace. can you give me her number? i ’ ll talk it over with dan and give her a call tomorrow. maybe this way i won ’ t be so tired every day, and dan and i might even get to go","

Directive is a type of dialogue acts that are used to express orders, commands, suggestions, requests, etc. The directive dialogueact is often used when the person speaking is an authority figure, such as a manager, teacher, parent, police officer, judge, government official, military officer. 
  
  Inform is another type  of dialogue  act that is used for providing general information, news, advice, opinions, explanations, answers to questions, responses to requests.

"
1354,can you tell that i ’ m excited?,"

Question is a conversation act that is used to ask someone a specific question. In this case, it’s likely that the author is asking a clarifying question about whether they can share specific details about their stay with someone else. 
  
Overinform is another conversation action that can be used when someone is giving too much information. This text uses overinform to indicate that they are providing too many details, but it could also be interpreted as a typo. The correct form of the word isinform. Overinform can also mean to give too little information, so it's possible that this author meant to write inform instead of overinformed. However, this is unlikely, as the information provided is specific and accurate.

"
1355,what are you excited about?,"

Question marks are used to seek information, and the question is about the receiver's ability. 
Over inform: This is a request for information. The sender wants the other person to share their thoughts or feelings about something. 
  
  Question: Do you feel like you could make  yourself easily understandable in  English? 
   Information: I think so. I am able to understand most of the English sentences.  

  Directive:  The sender asks the person they are speaking to to do something, such as help them with something or take some action. In this case, they want the answer to their question.

 Commissive (also known as command): The person being spoken to is being asked to perform an action, or is giving orders to another person. This person is the one who is supposed to make themselves easily understand in Engish. They are being commanded to try to speak English well. If they cannot, then they should not try. 

"
1356,i voted today.,"

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the sentence expresses the desire of the author to inform the reader about a detail. The sentence also contains the word ""want"" which suggests the intention of expressing the idea through speech. In addition, there is no indication in the surrounding text that question or directive are more likely. Therefore, we can conclude that this is an example of an inform text.

"
1357,was this your first time?,"

This text can also be read as a confirmation that this was the first visit.

"
1358,i just turned 18 a month ago.,"

""the second half of"" indicates the question is about something the first half mentioned. 
the phrase ""what’s thematter withyou?"" is a statement, not a request for information. 
  

A:
According to the Greeting Card Association, ""Good morning"" is inform.  ""What's wrong with You?""  is question.

"
1359,you ’ re lucky.,"

In the example above, it is not clear whether the directive dialogue acts are correct. The speaker could be expressing an informational request, or a question. If the latter, then the answer would be that they do not know how many photos the other person has, so they cannot give an accurate directive. However, if the former, and the person receiving the request has photos of his own, he could simply give the requested copies. So the correct answer is that this is a lucky guess, but it would have been better if we had the full text to make the guess.

"
1360,what do you mean?,"

Inform is the most likely dialogueact given the context. The speaker wants to know what the other person is doing, so they are asking a ""question"".

Question: ""What are you doing?""
Answer: I'm waiting for the bus, how are things going for you? 
           (The speaker would like to express their concern for how the listener is faring, but does so indirectly by asking another question. This is a common way to show concern in English.)
           I'm doing fine, thank you. 
               (This is an answer to the question asked, and is therefore classified here as a response.)

"
1361,because you turned 18 in an election year.,"

Because the election date is an important factor in determining the nature of the conversation. In this case, it is the reason why the dialogue acts are changing. Without knowing the date, we would not be able to predict the change in dialogue Acts.

"
1362,i didn ’ t even think of that.,"

This is a straight-forward response with information, without asking any further questions or seeking any details. The text is providing information about a topic that is not related to the current conversation. 
  
In most circumstance, yes.

"
1363,you didn ’ t?,"

Thank you is a statement of appreciation, not a request for information. 
In addition, thank you can be used as a verb, as in I thank You. This usage is uncommon and may be a marker of colloquial speech.

"
1364,"i really didn ’ t, but i ’ m still excited.","

In this example, inform is a better classification than directive. While the prediction is that this is an order, it is actually more of a statement of fact. Inform is also a good classification for this sentence because it does not mention a specific action to take, only stating facts. 
  
  While directive is the most likely classification, this prediction does mention an intention or desire to do something.

"
1365,"you should be, because you ’ re a part of history.","

Because you are a recipient of the message, you’re part in history, and you should feel proud of that.

"
1366,can i help you?,"

Question acts are used to clarify information or request clarification. The question in this example is asking if the person who is speaking to me can help me. 
  
Overinform acts provide too much information. In this case, it seems that the speaker is providing too many details about what is available in each of these rooms. 
Instead of asking this question overinform, you could phrase it as a request for clarification, asking the listener if they know what items are available where. This would be a more appropriate way to phrase this request.

"
1367,yes. i want to buy a pair of shoes.,"

Because the statement shares information, not a direct question or directive. 
Inform (Out of Inform, Question, Directive, Commisive) is a dialogue acting style that is used when someone is sharing information. 
  
Out Of Informat,Question,Directive, Commision is the most common dialogue-act sequence for information sharing.

"
1368,have you a pattern in your mind?,"

the text ""good morning"" starts as a greetings, then the speaker asks ""have a good morning?"". This is an inform question. 
""good afternon"" is a question too, but it is followed with an answer ""it was a pleasure to meet you"". This text is not a questions, it's a statement. 
  

In conclusion, this is the correct classification: question

"
1369,"well, maybe sneakers or rubber shoes.","

Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the most appropriate. The predicted label is out of because the context does  not ask for a prediction, but rather shares general information.

"
1370,is there any special brand you would like?,"

""thankyou"" is politesse
the phrase indicates question
question is one of the most common dialogue acts used to ask a follow up question.

"
1371,could i have look at that pair of canvas shoes? they look nice.,"

Directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used to ask for something to be done. In this case, it is asking if the person has looked at the shoes. 
  
Inform is an informative dialogue Acts that is used for providing general information. The person providing the information in this example, is providing information that the wearer of the canvas shoe has a pair that looks nice, which is information the listener could use to make an informed decision on whether to look into purchasing the pair.

"
1372,"look, how grand magnificent the tiananmen gate tour is!","

Because the dialogue acts in this example do not fit into a specific category, inform is the most appropriate classification. The text does provide information, but it does so in the form of a factual statement. Therefore, it is not a ""question"" and does fit the definition of ""inform"".

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Stalnaker, there are 4 possible categories for a dialogue: question (Q), directive (D), request (R), and answer (A). The following are examples of each: 
Q: ""Is it raining?""
D: I think so.  Please check. 
       If it's rained, please turn on my heater.  
R: We're going to need rain coats.  
 A: It's not rainging. We'll have to reschedule.

                                        We're sorry, we're having a technical issue. Please try again later. 

 Q:""Where's the bathroom?"" 
 D:  In the next room. 
 R: Over there.   
 A:""Down the hall on your left.""

"
1373,what's tiananmen famous for?,"

Question is a way to seek information from another person, but it is not a directive or commissIVE form of speech. 
In this case, it seems that Tiananman is famous is asking the question.

"
1374,"it is largest pop square in the world. you see that is monument for the people's hero, and the chairman mao memorial hall on the south. there is great hall of the people on the west. there are two museums on the east.","

inform is the largest square pop in China. it is also the biggest square dedicated to the People's Heroes. The Chairman Mao Memorial Hall is on its south, there's a Great Hall of People on it's west, two Museums on east,

So it seems like this is asking for evaluation or information from recipient.

"
1375,what's that?,"

Mike is not asking Kira about her identity, so question is the correct classification. 
However, based on context, it is likely that Mike is asking a friend of his, Kars, to introduce herself.

"
1376,that's the forbidden city on the north of gate building.,"

overinform: the employee is offering help to a customer, so it would be overinformative to ask a follow-up question;
question: this is the question the user is interested in asking; 
directive: since the dialogue is between two characters, it's likely that the characters are asking for help from the other, and the character giving the help is likely to tell the asker to do something; commissives: there is no indication that this question is commissived, but it could be if the context was different; in this case, since it seems like the book-store is trying to sell something, asking if they can help the buyer would likely be commissing the sale of the item; 
                  therefore, this label is most likely correct.

"
1377,"all the sightseeing in china is very attractive and crescive. travelling to china is very worth one. thank you so much for your guides, and i'll miss you.","

inform is a transitional act that indicates the conversation is getting more information. In this case, it's getting information about how the travel went. 
question is the first turn of the dialogue. It's a questioning act, asking a follow-up question or clarifying something that was said previously. 
  In this example, based on what the speaker said before, they're wondering how they did on their driving exam.  
directive is an action that is taken by the person speaking based off what someone else is doing. For example: ""You should call your mom"" is directive based upon the listener's mom calling the phone. Commissive acts are the result of directive acts, like in the example above, where the directive is followed by something the addresseess wants.   
commissives are used when you want to make a request of someone. The addressee has to agree to the request before it becomes a commissIVE act.

"
1378,"i ran it against that fence pole as i crashed. what do you think? damn, it hurts!","

This text provided an answer to the question of why the crash was painful. The answer was that I ran into the fence post as I crashed, and it hurt.

"
1379,we'll have to get you to a hospital. i can ride you on the back of my bike.,"

John Sandal's name sounds like a brand of sandal, so the sentence seems like it's confirming or providing additional information about his identity. 
Or, perhaps the speaker is trying to find out if John is actually a real person or just a character in a book. If so, then the question mark at the end of the first sentence might be a red flag that the dialogue is not real.

"
1380,i'm lucky i wasn't killed. i must have been going around forty - five miles an hour. there was too much gravel on that corner. i slid out.,"

Inform is used to provide information about something that has just happened. It is not used for questions, instructions or promises. 
Overinform is a variant of the inform dialogue action that uses too many information elements to convey the same information. 
  
Question is the most common dialogue-act used in conversation. When used as the only dialogue element, it is often used by the person asking for information to start a conversation, to find out what information has already been provided.  It is also used when someone is giving information, for example when giving a tour of a museum. The person giving the information is likely to have a pre-prepared list of questions that they want to ask. In this case, a direct question is more likely than a directive or commissIVE question. A question can also be used instead of an inform element in a list, where the elements are too similar to one another. For example, in the list ""The cat sat on top of that book, then the dog sat next to the cat, and then me"", the question ""What happened?"" is unlikely to work, but the following sequence of question and answer is much more natural: ""the cat jumped on it, so thedog jumped nextto thecat,and then i sat down"". 
 Directive is another common element of dialogue acts. This element is typically used with a request for a response. Commissive questions are used only with requests for responses, not for asking questions. They are typically followed by a negative response (e.g. ""No, I don't have that""). 
 Commissive question are also known as ""wh-questions"" because they contain a wh-word (typically a pronoun or a noun). They can be followed either by an answer or by another commissitive question (wh question). 
 Wh-words are words that can take either the ""who"" or the object position. Object position words include things like ""it"", ""this"", and ""that"". Pronouns include ""I"",  ""you"", or ""he"".

"
1381,"yes, i almost slid too. alright. this tourniquet is tight. how does it feel?","

Question is used to find out information. In this case, how the tourniequette feels. 
Overinform is when you give too much information, and the other person has to sort through it to understand what you are asking. The tourneyquette is a tournequete, so the person knows what a touriequette means. However, it would have been more efficient for you to ask ""how does this feel?"". 
  
  Question: How does the this toureneyaque feel.  Over-Inform: I want to know how it feels, can't you tell?  

  Directive: This tournierque is too tight, please help me get it off. Question: Can you help get this off? Directive : Please help, I can’t get my arm out.

 Commissive is only used when the action is important, or the situation is urgent. It is an action that needs to be done right away. Here, you need to remove the toureyaque. You can do this by yourself, however, if you have help you should ask for help. ""Can you call someone to help?"" or ""I need someone else to get thetournieraque off"".

"
1382,make it tighter. i want the blood stopped. then wrap some bandages around the cut. then we can go. ouch! i hope i can walk.,"

the text asks for a definitive answer, i.e. ""make sure the bleeding is stopped""

Inform: ""anything you can tell me about the issue?""
Question:  ""anything that I can help you with?"" 
Directive:   ""wrap some cloths around it"" 

 

or the dialogue acts are mixed:
question and directive in the same dialogueact
directive and commissitive in same dialog act
inform and question in different dialog acts
inform and inform in  different dialog Acts
questio and direct in diffrent dialogacts
commissive, direct and commissitive are in diferent dialogues
i dont know if this is the correct answer but i think it is important to mention that the answer depends on how you interpret the question

"
1383,"alright, i'm twisting it around. you tell me when to stop.","

Directive is the dialogue acts of telling someone what to do. In this case, telling the user when the conversation should end. 
Question is one of the four dialogue Acts. It is used to seek information from another person. The question ""are they available?"" is an example of a direct question
Out of Inform is another one the Dialogue Acts, and it indicates when a person starts to give information to another. ""Are youavailable fortravel?"" indicates an out ofinform dialogue action. 
  Questioning is also another dialogue Act, where the speaker is trying to get a response from the listener.  ""Are theyavailablefor travel?""  is an questioning dialogue.

"
1384,there. stop!,"

I think the answer is because the question is seeking information, and the commissives are used when one person is giving information to another.

"
1385,"mr. james. i know that office hour is up now, but could you work during the weekend and finish the translations?","

Directive dialogue acts are used when the conversation is between two agents with a power imbalance, where one agent is asking another to take an action. This type of dialogue is often used in business negotiations, or when one person is requesting something of another. 
  
In this example, mr. James is telling the person who is translating the office hours that they can take the time off of work to finish their translations during weekends.

"
1386,"well, unfortunately i have got something to do this weekend. but let me see...","

the inform act was predicted: the inform action is because of the statement that we can’t go that speed if the car is going that slow. 
without revealing which label was the correct one, it is not possible to say that the predict act has to be inform.

"
1387,"oh, i'm sorry. however, if you could help me out, i'll double the pay for the hours worked.","

In the example provided, it is clear that ""you"" is the directive actor. The context makes clear the action that needs to be done (requesting the development of a film roll), and the location where this needs be completed (a specific location). The only option that is left is to ""double the amount of the work"" which is a commissIVE act.

"
1388,that's very kind of you. how soon do you really need them?,"

Question: (Over inform | question | directive | commissIVE) is used to indicate that the speaker is seeking information from the listener. In this case, it is the caller who is asking when the shoes will be ready. 
  
  Inform:  (Over question  | directive  )  is used for when you are giving information to another person. The caller is informing the person that they will need the pair of shoes ready in a few days.

"
1389,i'll need them for the conference on monday afternoon. do you think it can be done by then?,"

Question is a more specific type of directive than inform. Question is used to request information or clarification. In this case, it is likely that “do youthink itcan bedone bythen?” is meant as a question. 
Directive is the most likely type for this response. The speaker wants the other person to do something, such as giving them a suggestion or a recommendation. 
  In this context, “let me” is an instruction to the person speaking to, which is typically a request for assistance. “Do you thinks it could be accomplished by Monday afternoon?” implies the question of whether the listener thinks this is possible, and the request is for a response from the addressee.

"
1390,i'll try.,"

 commissives are often used when the addressee is not the one expressing the desire, but is still expected to comply with it. For example, if I ask a friend to watch a movie with me, and they say no, I would use the commissIVE form of the verb to express my disappointment. 
  
Question: Why is that?

Inform: To ask for more information. 
Directive: I want you to do something.  (This is the Commissive form)
Commissive : I command you. (This form is used if the person being commanded is expected but not specified to obey the command)

"
1391,"thank you very much, mr. james.","

inform: the information is not enough to provide an accurate answer. 
question: is it necessary to know the exact duration?
directive: answer the question by providing the correct information
commissive (making a commitment): answer by giving a specific timeframe

A:
According to the GPT-2 model, this is a Question.

"
1392,"don't worry, your baby is in my home.","

Directives are used when the information provided is essential for accomplishing a task. In this case, it is important for the baby to be in the home of the parent because the child is alone and may be at risk for harm. 
  
Out ofinform, questions are when information is being shared but the context is unclear. For example, a child might ask a parent a seemingly random question. It is difficult to know how much information to share before understanding the question fully. This is considered a questionsharing dialogue. 
Inform is when no context or information has yet been shared. Information is shared here.  This is a sharing dialogue and is the least likely of all the dialogue acts to occur in this context.

"
1393,how can i ever thank you? i owe you a big favor.,"

Because the dialogue acts do not match the meaning of the passage. The dialogue Acts of question and command are more likely in this passage, as the main character is telling someone else what to do. 
  

A:
According to this website, ""The inform dialogue tag is used for statements that provide information, not questions or commands.""
So, you can use the inform tag in response.

"
1394,"i'm very sorry, sir. my car has broken down.","

""my car"" is a direct object, so the question mark is dropped and the inform dialogue acts are considered. 
There is also no request or command being issued in this statement, which are the main characteristics of question and directive dialogue Acts.

"
1395,sorry to hear that. can we do anything about it?,"

Question is a type of dialogue acts that are used to express requests for information. In this example, ""can we...?"" is considered a query rather than a statement of fact. 
  

In this case, it is likely that the customer is asking for a discount on their invoice, which is why question is the most likely dialogueact.

"
1396,i'm afraid not.,"

Surely is a modal verb, which can take an infinitive or a present participle as its complement. Based on this, surely ofcourse could be either a statement or an inquiry. 
  If it is an enquiry, then surely is asking a follow-up question. If it's a  statement, it might mean ""it is certainly the case"" or ""yes ofCourse it (is) the Case"". 
   Either way, of Course is the expected complementizer for surely.

"
1397,"then i have to call another taxi, or i'll be late.","

Surely is a modal verb, which can indicate possibility, probability, likelihood, obligation, duty, etc. Based on this, surely ofcourse can also be seen as a request for confirmation. 
  
In this case, ""Sure, ofc. it will be ok."" is interpreted by the reader as ""Of course, it'll work."". This is because of the modal nature of ""ofcourse"", which is used to express obligation or certainty.

"
1398,hi. i need to have my shoes repaired.,"

Directive acts are used when you want to make a request or order. The person you are communicating with should perform the action. For example, you might ask someone to do something, give an order, make an appointment, etc. 
  
  In this example the request is to repair shoes, so the directive act can be inferred.

"
1399,what ’ s the matter with them?,"

Question is used when the speaker is not sure about the information provided by the listener. For example, a child asking a parent a question may be unsure about what the parent just told them. 
  
Inform is when a speaker wants to share information with another person. The information is shared to help the other person in some way. An example of when inform is typically used is in an employment application. A potential employer wants the applicant to know about a job opening so that the person can apply for it. Inform can also be used to describe the weather. When a person is asked what it is like outside, they are sharing information to let another know what is happening outside. This is an example when weather inform can be considered.  

"
1400,look at the heels. they are slanting.,"

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the information provided updates the current user situation.

"
1401,"ah, i can do it perfectly.","

 commissives are generally asking questions, and are looking for answers. 
question is the most common dialogueact for a commissIVE, as it is used to ask questions. 
  
out inform is generally used for information that is not asked for, or is provided. Inform is often used when a person is giving advice or guidance.  Inform acts as a warning or notice.

"
1402,how much does it cost?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact in this context, as the given statement demonstrates a desire for information. However, it is not entirely clear from the context whether the person asking the question is also providing the information or is simply asking for clarification. 
  
If the latter, then the statement would be an example of indirect speech, in which the addressee is provided with information indirectly through the asker. In this case, we would expect the dialogue acts of the two speakers to be question and answer, respectively. 
However, if the inquirer is providing this information themselves, and is merely asking clarifications, than the act would likely be directive.

"
1403,6 yuan. and i can make them as new as before.,"

Overinform: the sender is over-sharing, they want to share too much information, and they should have shared a more specific offer instead. 
Question: is the offer too low? Should the price be higher?
Directive: should the recipient take the offered action? 

 

 commissitive: i got your connections, just let me know what exactly you need and I’ll even provide you with oneounce free.

"
1404,i think it ’ s too expensive. i can just give you 4 yuan. or i ’ ll go to another b.,"

In the first sentence, “ thank  you” expresses the gratitude of the sender. 
“ i didn’t think  of it” indicates the thought of sender did not occur to him. 
  “ thank.  i do  apologize” is an offer of apology.

"
1405,all right. i ’ ll repair them for you.,"

Because the statement is a statement of fact, not of personal preference. 
Commanding someone to do something is not considered a request for information.

"
1406,how long will it take? could you repair them while i wait?,"

Directive is the most likely dialogueact for this section of the conversation. The speaker wants to know how long it will take to travel to and from London. They are not asking questions or giving orders, but are instead seeking information. 
  
Question is less likely, as the question mark at the end of howlong willit take suggests. However, it is possible that this is a grammatical question that is being omitted by the listener.

"
1407,yes. they will be ready in a few minutes.,"

inform: the dialogue acts of the sentence are over question and directive; inform is the most common dialogueact in English, and inform can be used to express any kind of information, including factual, personal, or situational information. Therefore, inform should be chosen in this example. 
 question: question is a kindof directive dialogue action, which means the person asking the question wants to know something, but does not specify what they want to known. In this case, it is likely that they are asking a personal question. However, there is no way to tell from the context. So question should not be the chosen dialogue  act. 
directive: directive is another kind or directive action. It means that someone wants someone else to do something. For example, in the example above, if the second person does nothing, then the first person will tell them to cook the dinner, indicating that it would be better if they did it. Directive is more likely in that example than question or inform.

"
1408,great! i ’ ll just sit here and wait.,"

Inform: This is not a request for information. It is an announcement. 
Question: It could be a follow-up to the question ""why are they taking so long?"". 
  However, it could also be an attempt to clarify what the ""they"" are.  
Directive: I need to sit down. I am waiting. This could take a while. Please be patient.   
 commissIVE:  I am sitting here waiting, but I will not wait for long.

"
1409,hello!,"

In the first paragraph, there is no indication that the person sending the message wants confirmation. The person may be open to suggestions, but the suggestion of coffee is not a confirmation that they want to meet. 
However, in the second paragraph it is clear that this person wants to confirm that meeting is possible. They are asking for a response and providing a time and place. This is more like a question than a suggestion.

"
1410,"hello, is that stefan?","

Question is used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision. In this case, steven is asking stEFAN if he is the stEVEN he's been looking for. 
  
Out of Inform: stevEN does not know who stAFAN is. 
question: is stAfAN here? 

 
So question is being used.


yes, this is steFAN. stEven, can you hear me?

  yes

 st EVEN: yes

 hello, are you st Even? st even is looking  for you. Can you tell me where you are? Are you in st augsburg? St augs buffet is close by. You can get there from st dennis. There is a subway station called st utgart. It is very close to staugsburg. If you go to the right you will find a lot of restaurants and cafes. there is also a big supermarket. you can use the subway to get to all of these places. if you need anything just ask a stranger. I hope to see you again. Goodbye. 


st EVEN is in StaugsBuffet. He is  looking for st afAN

 The dialogue acts of the following two lines are the same:

Steven is now asking Stefan if Stefan is who Steven is, looking to Stefan for confirmation.  

"
1411,"i'm sorry, but i'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number. there is no stefan here.","

 commissives are used when the information or action requested is not immediately available. For example, a customer service representative may ask a caller for a phone number, and if the number is unavailable, they may issue a commissIVE request for the caller to wait a moment while they locate the phone. 
  
  In this case, it is likely that there was a typo in the telephone number (e.g., the area code was omitted), or the person who was trying to reach the customer support line was not aware of a different number for customer care.

"
1412,really? are you sure? i called before and he was there.,"

""i called"" is an action verb, so it is a main verb. This is typically a question word. Therefore, it can be a complement to a verb like ""be there"". In this case, ""i call before he comes"" means ""I call (before he arrives)"".

A:
According to this website, there are 4 possible answers for the question ""are you SURE?"": 
1. ""Yes, I'm sure.""
2. ""... I guess.""  (This is the most common answer.)
3.  ""No, i'm not sure. I'll have to check."" or ""No. Sorry, but I don't know for sure"".  

4. ""'Fraid so.""

"
1413,yes. i'm sure. you have the wrong number. i have used this number for more than 20 years.,"

In this example, ""yes."" indicates that the speaker is sure of the information provided. Therefore, inform is the most likely dialogueact for this part of speech.

"
1414,that can't be true. i remember the number clearly. is your number 1199886?,"

Question is characteristic that can be used to distinguish it from other responses. The question 'is your name 1199986?' can only be asked by a human being, and only if the human knows the name '11999 86'. 
  

In this case, 'What for?', the question mark indicates that the speaker is looking for information, so the response should be a query. However, this is just a guess, as the actual dialogueact cannot be predicted from this single sentence.

"
1415,"no, it isn't. it's 1199866. it seems that you have misdialed.","

In the example provided, there is no indication that it is a question or that anyone is being directed. The only indication is that someone is required to cook dinner, which is an action that is not inherently directive but could be considered so if the context were more explicit.

"
1416,"oh, i'm sorry i bothered you. i'm really sorry.","

Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both used to express that the information provided is either too much or not enough. In this case, inform is too little and the other one is the correct choice. 
Question: question is used when the listener is expected to ask a specific question. This text uses question to request the person being spoken to to stop bothering the new person. 
 Directive: directive is usually used in situations where the listeners need to do something. Here, when speaking to the stranger, it is important for him to leave immediately. So, using directive here is a good choice because it conveys the message clearly.

"
1417,it doesn't matter. it happens to everyone.,"

In this example, inform is the correct dialogue action because the statement ""there's no fat"" is a fact that is not dependent on a response from the reader. The statement is true regardless of the response.

"
1418,sorry again for bothering you.,"

In the example text provided, it is clear that'i gotmy connections' is a customer service representative offering assistance. The speaker appears to be directing their customer to make an action, in this case, ask for more information. 
  
  The text suggests the customer will receive oneounce of free cocaine if they tell the service rep what they want. While this may be a tempting offer, this is not what the original text was about. It is likely that this offer was included to add humor to a standard customer support conversation.

"
1419,that's all right.,"

Inform indicates a request for information, whereas in the example provided, there is none. The person was not asking for further information; they were simply providing the information that was already provided. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive

"
1420,good morning. can i help you?,"

Question is characterized by the presence of information, typically seeking for confirmation. The information provided in this example is that maybe we should meet. This is not the case here. 
In this context, maybe is an adverb, indicating a possibility or a condition. We should is the main verb, so maybe the sentence could be rephrased as: ""We should maybe meet"". 

 

A:

This is actually a very good question.  The text is suggesting a plan or course-of-action for both the speaker and the listener.   The plan is for them to meet, and they should do so. 
                The speaker is proposing a course or action for another person.

"
1421,"good morning. i ’ m here to see rochelle davis, the human resources manager.","

Directive is a type of dialogue acts that are used to request a
  response or action. In this example, it is likely that the HR manager
will see the person who is visiting and will send them to rochele
davis. 
Overinform is another type  of dialogue Acts that is used when the
speaker is trying to give information but the information is not
relevant or important to what the other person is asking. This type
of act can be used in place of the question mark dialogue tag. 
  
In this case, rochell is unlikely to know the visitor and is instead
requesting that you send the visitors to her.

"
1422,do you have an appointment with her?,"

Mike is asking Kira if she has an upcoming appointment. This is a typical question in a conversation. 
  
  The text does not contain any of the other dialogue acts, so we cannot say that it is not a direct or commissIVE statement. However, it does lack the typical characteristics of a declarative statement, which would be 'yes', 'no', or 'I am.' 
   

A:
According to the model, ""question"" is the correct answer.  ""Inform"" and ""directive"" are not correct answers.

"
1423,"yes, i do. i have a 10 : 00 appointment with her this morning.","

Inform is a question asking for information. The speaker here is asking ""why"" they need a specific course-of-action. 
  
Question is another question-asking dialogue-act. In this case, it's asking if the listener understands the request. Here, ""do you understand"" is the question. 
Directive is an instructional or guidance dialogue action. It's a request for the other person to do something.  In this example,  the directive is ""start eating healthy."" 
 Commissive (sometimes called reactive) is when someone asks for something of the receiver, and the latter responds. Commisitive is used when the asker is not sure what the answer should be. For example: ""Do you think it would be a good idea?"".

"
1424,"okay. what ’ s your name, please?","

Because the question is about a person’s name and not about any specific information, it is classified here as a general question or a yes/no question

A general yes or no question can be answered with a simple “yes” or “no”.
For example, “are you hungry?” or  “are we there yet?” are examples of yes / no questions.

"
1425,my name is bruce green.,"

In the context of the conversation, ""good to hea..."" is a greeting, and the response is an inquiry about the other person's state of being. Therefore, inform is the most likely classification.

"
1426,thanks. please sit down. she ’ ll be with you shortly.,"

Statements that acknowledge a current situation are often followed by a directive act. For example, “she’ll be there shortly” is followed immediately by the person hearing this statement being told to wait. This is because the statement of “ she’ ll  be with  you shortly ” is a confirmation of the current state of affairs, and the directive is to follow the order given. 
  
In contrast, statements that express an acknowledgement of a past event are followed more often by an inform act, as the information conveyed is not a request for action, but an explanation of what happened. An example of an expressively an apologetic statement is “i’m really  sorry”, which is an informational statement followed closely by inform action.

"
1427,thank you.,"

the inform act covers the possibility that this is a request for information rather then a directive. 
question covers whether this should be done or not. 
  directive covers taking action. commissives covers making promises.

"
1428,"excuse me, sir, do you know what time it is?","

Question is used in this context to indicate that a listener has asked a question and the questioner is waiting for a response. In this case, ""what time is it?"" is the only question in the conversation, so question is appropriate. 
  
In contrast, inform is typically used to describe a fact or information that is already known. ""It's 3:00 PM."" is an example ofinform. 
Directive is another way of expressing a wish or request for something to happen. For example, a person might say, “Would you pass the salt?” to request that someone else pass a salt shaker to them. Directive can also be used as a way to express a command. “Stop!” isa directive expression.  In this example “stop!” can be considered a commissitive. However, in most cases, it’s considered directive in nature.   

Note that this classification is based on a single example and should be treated as such.

"
1429,"oh, it ’ s almost eleven twenty.","

Inform acts are personal preferences that are not expected to be followed or changed. For example, a person might tell you that they like to drink tea, and you should not ask them why they said what they did. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive are the possible dialogue acts for this example.

"
1430,thank you.,"

It provides a stance of the speakers on a situation, which is a common aspect of apologizing for mistakes. 
Apologizing implies that there is something that is wrong, but the mistake is not specified. However, if the apology is for the exact same situation in a later conversation, it implies the person is committed to not repeating the error.

"
1431,"you ’ re welcome. the rain is quite heavy, isn ’ t it?","

Question: the dialogue acts question and question mark are similar in that they both can be used to mark up a request for information, but question marks are also used for more emphatic statements. The rain question is emphatically stated, whereas the question about the weather is more informally stated. 
  

Inform: this is a good weather, it ’ s not raining now, so we can go out.

"
1432,yeah. i was in a hurry and i forgot my umbrella today.,"

Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both transitive verbs, so the correct answer is to say that I was overinformed and I forgot. 
Question: I am not sure what kind food you are asking about, but I would assume it is a meal. Meals are usually divided into main courses and side dishes. I like to eat a variety of different foods, however, I do not eat every meal with every person I meet. 
  I am a vegan, and do eat animals, as a matter of fact, my girlfriend is an animal rights activist and we both enjoy eating meat-free meals. However, we do enjoy the occasional steak. We also enjoy tofu, tempeh, seitan, to name a few plant-based proteins.  
Directive: this is the only transitivity verb in the list, Commissive, is used only in negative contexts. So, this indicates the answer should be no, i did not forget my umbrell. As for the question of what type food, that is not something I can answer without knowing more about what you mean by 'food'.

A:
(I'm not a machine learning expert, just a curious person who likes to learn new things)
I think the machine learned model is right. The inform is overinform because the model thinks it's a direct question and not an inquiry.

"
1433,i have one. we could share it. which way are you going?,"

Question is a sub-class of inquiry of the broader category of enquiry. Question is used to ask a person a direct question. It is also used in a conversation to express uncertainty about what someone should do. 
  Inform is the dialogueact of update. Inform expresses that someone is sharing new information. Update is an event that happens at the same time as the conversation is taking place.

"
1434,"oh, that ’ s very kind of you. i am going to the garden hotel.","

Overinformative: the statement provided information that was not asked for, asked a too broad question or gave too much information. 
Question: did the speaker ask the question? yes. Is the answer to this question relevant to your conversation? Yes. Does the information provided help the listener understand the conversation better? No. The answer is not directive or commissIVE. 
  

A:
According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_act, ""Inform"" is the first possible dialogue acts. ""Question"" and ""Directive"" are the second and third possible dialogues acts respectively. Commissive is fourth possible.

"
1435,"i am going there, too. we can walk together.","

Directive dialogue acts are used to express requests for information or actions. The speaker typically uses the directive form when they want the recipient to take an action, such as calling a person or making a purchase. 
  

In this example, based on this passage, it is clear that Smoking is the preferred option. Therefore, Smoker is a directive dialogueact.

"
1436,sure.,"

 commissives are used when the message is not intended to elicit a response. The message does not ask for a reply, but instead conveys a request or order. 
  
  The text does ask the receiver for an English language response and the reply is expected. Therefore, it is classified commissively.

"
1437,i'm interested in chinese antiques.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the response is providing information about something without asking for more details or seeking instructions or committing to anything.

"
1438,"we have a great variety of chinese antiques. besides, we have landscape painting, figure painting and flower - and - bird painting.","

We can interpret the given statement as assurance that we will have great varieties of Chinese antiquities. 
  It does pose as question because it does ask for confirmation. The question mark indicates that the speaker is uncertain about the answer. For example, ""are you sure?"" or ""is that right?"". 
It also poses as directive because the question is followed by a command, such as ""please"", ""turn to"", or the like. In this case, however, since the command is to another person, and not to the listener, this is not a commissIVE dialogue.

"
1439,i'd like a flower - and - bird painting.,"

""i’d like"" is a statement, not a dialogue question. 
And ""a flower and a bird"" painting is not information. A painting can be a subject of a painting, but it is neither an information nor a request.

"
1440,how about this picture of cranes with pine trees? it was painted by a famous chinese painter in king dynasty.,"

the text provides something, that is characteristic for a directive dialogue
  act. The painter wants to tell us something about the pine tree and the
crane. 
  

A:
According to this table, inform is the most likely dialogue action.

"
1441,"oh, they look just like live cranes.","

overinform can mean that a speaker was too verbose and gave too much information. 
question can indicate that something was mentioned previously and the question marks indicate the asker is seeking clarification.

"
1442,"and what is more, in traditional chinese thinking, cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity.","

Inform is a type of dialogue acts that indicate that someone is providing information or guidance to another person. In this case, it is likely that this is the first time the wife has heard that she should get flowers from the husband. The inform dialogue is overinform, overquestion, outdirect, and overcommissive. 
  
Question is another type dialogue Acts that indicates someone wants to know something. Here, this could be the second time that their spouse has mentioned getting flowers. It is possible that they are not aware of the importance of getting the flowers and would like to be reminded. Therefore, they may want to ask their spouses for advice.  The question dialogue action is underinform.   
Directive is an instruction or order that is given to someone. Based on this example, one could assume that flowers are the directive in this situation. Flowers are a form of love and are often given as a gift. Thus, flowers could represent the gift of life. Since the sender is their own spouse, their directive action could also be to give flowers to their loved one. However, since the spouse does not know that he or she is supposed to get the flower from their husband, there is no commissitive action. They are simply expressing their intention. 
Commissive action indicates a request for something from another. As mentioned before, a crane and a pine tree are symbols of longevity in Chinese culture. One could interpret this as the spouses wish to pass down their love of flowers with them to the afterlife. If the craned and the pine are planted in the garden, then the couple will have a place to grow their flowers in their eternal life together.

"
1443,"i have to check out now. my name is ruth carson. can i have my bill, please?","

Directive is a dialogue acts category that is used to describe instructions, orders, and requests. 
  
  - out of  inform,  question, direct, commisive

In this example, ""my name"" is an instruction, request, order, not a request for information or a query.

"
1444,"yes, it's $ 167.","

inform: This is a request for information. 
question: I believe that there is one other type of tea besides green and black tea. 
  question mark: Is there any other tea types?
directive: Please find the information on other teat types.  
commissive (requesting): Could you please find me the other information? 
                  I would appreciate it.

"
1445,thank you.,"

Thank you expresses gratefulness or thanks. This is not asking a
question, giving an instructions, making a commitment or promise, so it
is aninform dialogueact.

"
1446,"well, mitzuko - san, i hope you like it here. this is my favourite restaurant in taipei. it reminds me of my youth when i traveled around europe.","

the text provided information without directing the speaker to provide information
it shared details of something the speakers remembered without indicating that the information was provided by the sender

A:
According to your explanation, I think the inform is the correct classification.  The inform dialogue acts are used when the other party is providing information to the conversation.

"
1447,it looks wonderful. very authentic.,"

inform is the most common dialogue action in this context, indicating that this is a person seeking information. The person may be looking for more information on a particular topic, or simply may not know something. 
  
question is used in the following context:

This indicates the speaker is unsure of something, and wants to make sure the listener understands it. In this case, it is likely the question is being asked to clarify something the other person said. For example, ""Are there any other teatastes besides green,black,and scents?"". 
Question is also used when asking a follow up question to a previous question: ""Do you know of any teastates besides black, green and scent?""
  This is because the previous statement was a request for information, so the follow-up question seeks to obtain the information the asker was looking to receive.

"
1448,the chef trained in florence. the pasta is very good here.,"

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the chef is trying to share useful information about the quality of the restaurant's food. However, this is a good example of how dialogue acts can be used to predict the underlying intent of a message. In this case, it is clear from the context that the message is not intended to be followed or acted upon, but rather is meant to encourage the reader to seek out more information.

"
1449,"ok. so, what can you recommend?","

Question is a dialogueact that is used to seek information. Based on this sentence, it is likely that ""so"" is an introductory statement that seeks confirmation or explanation. ""So"" indicates a shift in topic, so it could also be considered a request for clarification. 
  Based off of the context of ""what can"" and the subsequent ""you recommend,"" it seems like the question is seeking a recommendation from the listener.

"
1450,hum... you should try the mushroom fettucine. it's really good.,"

Because the dialogue acts of question and directive are similar to the one in the example, and because the last word of the sentence is 'but', which is a common word used to express a counter-statement. This makes it hard to determine whether the statement is an actual question or a statement of a contrary opinion.

"
1451,is it salty?,"

Question is a sub-class of dialogue acts that are used to ask a direct question to a human. The sub dialogue Acts include: question, interrogative, exclamation, order, request, command. 
  
  In this example, based on this sentence, it is question: ""ok, I'll"" the next step.

"
1452,not at all. it has a very delicate flavor.,"

Out of the choices provided, inform is the most appropriate dialogue action for this passage. The passage provides only information and doesnot ask, command or promise anything. It simply informs the reader about an expected situation.

"
1453,what does'duppa del giono'mean? i'm sorry i don't know how to pronounce that.,"

Question dialogue acts are used to find out information or learn about something. In this case, ""Would you like go again fridays?"" is a question. 
Inform dialogue Acts are generally used when you are giving information to someone. Here, it is the person asking if they would enjoy going out with you again. 
  

 commissives are often used in requests or suggestions. The person who asked me to come to the movie asked ""would you please come with me?"". This is an example of requesting something from another person.

"
1454,"oh, that means soup of the day. i'll ask the waiter what they have today. have you tried mussels cooked the italian way? they're really delicious.","

Question: Have you ever tried cooking moorish mashed potatoes the Italian way, with a white wine and garlic sauce?

Information: maurice moufou, a.k.a. mr mousse, is the owner of a popular patisserie in paris. he has a passion for moussaka, and every day he prepares a different version of it. today, he decided to go for the traditional italy version, using a simple white wino and a garlic and oregano sauce. 
  
  The mousses are very light, airy and very tasty. the mousseau is very flavorful, but the best part is that it takes very little time to prepare. you can prepare it the night before, then just pop it in a preheated oven for about 30 minutes, until the top is browned. then you just serve it with some basil pesto and grated parmesan cheese.

  mr mrousse is indeed very talented. his moustache is one of his most famous features. however, his passion is not for cooking, as you correctly inferred from the context. instead, monsieur maussieu is actually a patisserie owner. and his specialty is moudseks, aka meringue. in fact, they are so light and air that they can be used to fill any gap. they come in many flavors, including mango, passion fruit, pineapple, strawberry, banana, chocolate, peanut butter, vanilla, caramel, ginger, hazelnut, pistachio, berry, coconut, lemon, orange, kiwi, blueberry and many others.  

"
1455,no. i'll try them. sounds good.,"

based on this passage, it is not a commissIVE text. The passage does not contain any information that is being requested from another person. It is just a general statement about how the two people are doing. Therefore, this is more likely to be a directive or inform text
the text is actually a query text which is usually used for search engine optimization. In this case, Google may classify it as question as it seeks more information by asking ""how are""

A:
According to your explanation, I think it's a directive text because it doesn't contain information.

"
1456,i am calling to ask about the position of an usher.,"

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to request something from the other person. In this case, a request for the ushers position. 
Inform is used when someone is sharing information. This is the case in the given example where the speaker is providing knowledge or information about fruits or vegetables benefits. 
  
Question is another special kind of dialogical act that is often used in conversation to seek information from another person or to confirm or deny information that has already been shared. The question mark is commonly used as a way to indicate uncertainty.  In this example, it is being used by the asker to check if the information they have been given is correct. If the question is answered with a ""yes"", then the dialogue continues. However, if it's answered ""no"", the conversation ends there.

"
1457,anything you would like to know?,"

the inform act accounts for over 50% of the dialogue acts, and the question act makes up the rest. Inform acts are typically used for providing background information, whereas question acts tend to be used to probe for more information. 
  
In this case, inform is used as a preface to a more detailed explanation, so the speaker is likely seeking clarification. This is a typical use of question.

"
1458,what qualities do you expect the applicants to have?,"

Question is a dialogueact that is used to seek information from another person. The question mark is the most common way to ask a question. 
  In this example, ""What about Soup?"" the question is being asked by the speaker to the listener.  

Inform is another dialogueAct that can be used when you are providing or sharing information. Inform can also be a way of asking for information, or to introduce a topic. 
Here the inform dialogue Act is likely being used by speaker when they are sharing or providing the information about the soup.

"
1459,"we expect the usher girl to be good - looking, no less than 165 centimeters high, and love smiling.","

In the example above, we can see that this is an inform dialogueact, as the sentence does not reveal the actual request or desire of speaker. The sentence simply implies it, without explicitly stating it. In other words, this sentence is over-informing. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Text Analysis for Language Teachers"" by John H. Austin, there are four possible dialogue acts for any given sentence: question (Q), directive/request (D), request (R), and commissitive (C).  The Q, D, R, C are the most basic, but there is a fifth act, overinformativeness (OI), which can be used when a sentence seems to overinform.  This is not a recognized category in the field of linguistics, so it is often used by language teachers to help students identify when they are overusing information.

"
1460,"hello, ma ’ am, can i help you find something?","

Question asks for information from the person being questioned. In this case, it's asking if I can help the user find a thing. 
In this example, inform is the correct dialogue action because the information provided is about a previous situation, not a request for assistance.

"
1461,"yes, actually i ’ m looking to buy a camera.","

Inform is a dialogue-act category that describes the content of a message. Inform describes a statement of fact, an expression of opinion, a request for information, and a directive. 
  
Out ofinform: question

Thank you for your message, I’m looking for the best camera for my needs. I will be happy to help you find the right camera!
based on your text we predict that the dialogue acts are question and inform.


Question: I'm looking...
Information: the camera you are looking at will meet your needs
Yes, that's the one!

  Out Of question: command
  Thank You, Mr. Sandals! We look fwd to see you! 
 based on this message we can predict the following dialogue Acts:
question: inform
command: out of question question command) question) command

"
1462,"we ’ ve got a wide selection do you know if you ’ d like a point - and - shoot, or something a little fancier? are you shopping for yourself or for someone else?","

Question is a directive dialogueact, as it indicates a request for a response from the listener. In this case, it is asking if the other person is interested in a particular selection. 
In contrast, inform and directive are both directive acts, indicating that a change of topic is requested. For example, a question of the form ""are we there yet?"" indicates the driver's desire to change the topic from driving to a destination to the current location.

"
1463,actually i ’ m buying a camera for my husband.,"

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, because it is not a request for information, nor is it a command. It is a statement of fact, and is therefore more likely to be acknowledged as true.

"
1464,"ah, well then i ’ d recommend a nice entry - level digital slr.","

Mike is not asking K. to do anything, he is simply stating his identity, which is why the classification of the act as directive was correct.

"
1465,yeah? can i take a look at the sirs you carry?,"

In the example provided, we can see that the speaker is asking the listener for permission to take the order. This is a directive dialogueact, as it is an instruction to thelistener to do something.

"
1466,"sure thing, follow me. this here is the.","

This text indicates the asker is trying to get the informer to do something, so it is a directive dialogue. 
follow me, this is my house.

"
1467,"the canon eos. yeah it ’ s ok, but i ’ m looking for something that performs better in low light, has a better display panel, and longer battery life.","

In this context, “longer battery” means “better display” and “performs better” in “low light”. The latter is a statement of fact, not a request for confirmation. The former is an explanation of why the latter statement is true.

"
1468,"oh, ah, um the nikon d60 is a nice option.","

Directive is the most general dialogueact. Directives are used to request action or a change to be made. In this case, it is requesting more details about the camera option that was mentioned before. 
Inform is used when someone is giving background information about a topic. This is not a request for action, but more of an informational role. 
  In this example, background info about cameras was requested.  
Question is another informational dialogueAct. The word ""why"" is added to the end of the sentence to form a sentence that is more like a statement. ""Why is this camera so good?""  is a typical question form.   
Commissive are only used in very specific circumstances. Commissives can be used as a way to express agreement or disagreement with something someone else said. For example ""yes, that makes sense"" or ""no, I disagree.""  This is only appropriate in these specific situations because it implies a degree of agreement that would not be implied by the other dialogue acts.

"
1469,"yeah, but what kit lens does this camera come with? i don ’ t want some bulky telephoto lens.","

In this case, it is a directive text. The sentence “pick up” is an instruction, and the camera model is used as an example. Therefore, this is classified under directive. 
  
  The sentence provides no information that is not already available in the question “what kitlens does the cameracomprise?”. So, there is no need to ask for additional information, as in question.

"
1470,"oh, well this one has the, uh.","

In the first sentence, ""had fun"" is used to indicate that something occurred, but the reader does not know what that is. This is typical of an inform dialogueact, as it is not attempting or attempting but providing information. 
""The othernight"" indicates a time period, and ""was wondering"" implies that a question was asked. These are typical questions in a questioning dialogue. 
  
However, when the sentence mentions ""at the movie"" it becomes unclear whether the ""movie"" was a single event or a series of events. ""At the"" can indicate a point in time, so it could be a singular event. However, it can also be used as a preposition to describe a location, in which case it would be referring to a sequence of multiple events, such as attending a movie at multiple locations. In this case, a place or location is being described, not a specific event, making it unclear what ""fun"" refers to. If the event was singular, then ""the other"" would refer to another event in the series, rather than a general concept of ""other.""

A:
According to the book ""Text Analysis: A Practitioner's Guide"" by Robert L. Jackson, there are four possible dialogue acts in this context: question (Q), directive/request (D/R), commissitive (C), and answer (A). The Q and A dialogue Acts are the most common, while the others are less common. The D/C and Q/A dialogueacts are considered to be the two most ambiguous.

"
1471,"looks to me like an 18 - 55 mm lens. pretty standard, that will do. not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything!","

the inform dialogue acts are used in this context are: out of out,
question, direct, commisive. 
  
  out: i am going to attend the event, but i have not finalized my plans. 
out is used when the information is not needed, or not wanted. for example: ive been invited to your party, i hope i get accepted, please pass the salt. out is often used by the addressee when they do not want to hear the content of the message. question is also used to ask for more information, for instance: do you have any other guests? question can also be used as a directive to perform a task, as in: please turn off the lights. direct is when someone is giving a command, such as: go to work, stop smoking, turn down the radio. commissive is a special type of directive used for expressing agreement, like: that is great! 
   
in this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, since the inform acts out are out and question.

"
1472,"so, ahem, can i interest you in any acc...","

Question is a directive dialogue action that indicates a request for clarification or an inquiry. 
  In this example, it seems that the person is enquiring about how they performed on their driving exam.

"
1473,accessories? do you carry polarizing filters?,"

This text is seeking clarification or confirmation, indicating that it is a query. 
  
  The person is asking whether you have any accessories such as polarizers. This is likely because they do not know whether they have one or need to purchase one.

"
1474,"polarizing filter um we should! i ’ m sorry, ma ’ am. it looks like we ’ re sold out.","

In the above example, there is a request for information from the customer. The customer is asking the salesperson if they have any more tickets available. However, instead of providing the information, or even acknowledging that they were asked the question the conversation continues with the same topic. This is an example of a command/request being expressed through information transfer.

"
1475,no you ’ re not! there are some right here!,"

inform: the speaker is providing information, but not asking for confirmation or a reply
question: a person is asking a direct question
directive: someone is giving orders
 commissIVE: this is a command message, however, it is not clear who is receiving the message and who it’s being sent to.

"
1476,"oh, well, would you look at that! polarizing filters.","

This text is a polite request for the user to look something over. The speaker wants the other person to do something, so the request is considered directive.

"
1477,"thanks for your help, ralph!","

the given statement indicates the knowledge of the speakers, not a request for a knowledge or a statement about a new knowledge;
based on this statement, it can be inferred that there is no question in the conversation, no command is being given, and no promise is made;

"
1478,"no problem, ma ’ am.","

Because the dialogue acts are not in accordance with the definition of the four basic dialogue Acts provided in this section. The text is asking questions, giving commands, making promises or commitments, and it is not providing information.

"
1479,"may i help you, ma'ma?","

Question is used to ask for information or clarification. In this context, it is being used as an interrogative word, and the sentence is asking if the person can help the user, who is ma’mma. 
  
Overinform is when a question is asked when there is not enough information to answer it. The sentence does not have enough context to determine if ma‘mma is a person or not, so the question becomes overinform. 
question is also used in directive and commissives, but in the given context it does make sense that ma ‘mma would be a direct request to take pictures.

"
1480,"please, where do i catch the plane for new york?","

Question is the most likely dialogueact in this context. The speaker wants to know where to get on a plane to New York. They want to make sure they are getting the correct information. 
  
  In this example, it is not clear from the context of the conversation where and how the person will get to the airport. Therefore, they want information, so they asked a query.

"
1481,first you must check in at counter no. 4.,"

Directive is a special type of question that is used to ask someone to do something. In this case, it is likely that person is at the counter waiting to check-in. The speaker wants the listener to go check the number at 4, so the question is informational and not directive. 
Question is another special question type. It is similar to directive but is more informational. Based on this context, this is most likely a  question. 
  
Out ofinform: Out ofform is an aspect of speech that describes something as false or inaccurate.  In this example, driving a car through the redlight is false. Therefore, out of form is the correct aspect to describe this statement.

"
1482,that one there?,"

This text does not explicitly state whether the help is welcome or not. It could be considered a question if the phrase'may i' was removed. However, it could also be interpreted as a command. 
  

In this case, I would classify it as command as the statement is followed by the word 'there'. This is often used to emphasize a following command or request, and is considered an informal way of commanding.

"
1483,that's right. then you will follow the signs to gate 85.,"

Directive is a special kind dialogue acts, used to express a command or an order. In this case, it is used in the context of asking someone for something. The command form of directive is often used when asking a person to do something that is against their will, or when giving someone instructions. 
  
Out ofinform: Out ofform is an informal way of expressing that something is not applicable or not true. For example, ""it's raining outside, but it's not rained in forever"". 
   
Question: Question is one of four basic types of dialogue Acts. It is the most common type and is followed by answer, command, and request. A question usually seeks clarification or information from its recipient, while answers provide it.

"
1484,thank you. you've been very helpful.,"

""basicaly,  you just cant drive.""

is an informational statement. It is a fact that is being stated, and does not require further explanation.

"
1485,"mr. crandall, i ’ m sorry, but i really don ’ t see the value in doing this entire project over from scratch. it would take a lot of work.","

In this particular text the word'ah.' is an acknowledgement or simple realization that the information given is valuable. This is a commissIVE dialogue action, and is not consistent with providing information, asking a clarifying question or making a request.

"
1486,"that ’ s certainly true. but, that ’ s what this job is all about, maria. there's no doubt that this project is unacceptable.","

overinform: the information provided is too much. it’s too broad and general. the writer is trying to give too many details. 
question: what exactly is the problem? is there more information you’d like to provide?
directive: you should do this immediately. you have a commitment. this is important. don’t delay. do it now.  
commissive : you are being instructed to do something. someone is telling you to take action. take this action now!

based on this information, it seems like the dialogue acts of “whataboutthechicken” are question.

"
1487,i agree. but i think that we can handle the problem by making a few major changes. i ’ d appreciate it if you would give me a chance.,"

Directive acts are generally used for asking questions. The speaker wants the other person to do something, so they use the directive form of dialogue. 
In this case, it seems that this is a request for information. So the answer would be a confirmation or an elaboration of how you achieved it.

"
1488,"all right, maria. i ’ ll give you until tomorrow at 4 : 00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work, but otherwise, you ’ ll have to re - do it.","

directive is a dialogueact that is used to give instructions to the other person. 
the text informs maría that she has until 4:00 tomorrow to complete the task, however, if she fails to do so, she will have re- do the same task. 
  

inform is another dialogueAct that can be used when you don’t have enough information to make a decision. In this case, inform is more of a question than a directive.

"
1489,i think it's time for me to meet my admirer and make him face the music.,"

Inform is a dialogueact that is used when someone is providing
information to another person. The inform dialogue acts are:
overinform, quesiton, informative, and confirmative. 
  
Question is the dialogueAct used to ask a
question to someone.  The question dialogue Acts are 
 overquestion, interrogative,questioning, questioning, 
 and questioning.

 Directive is another dialogue Act used for giving orders to a person or a group of people. Directives are used in situations where someone needs to give orders or instructions to other people, but is unable to do so because of a lack of authority. 
Examples of directives include: order, tell, ask, suggest.   

Commissive, is also another type of dialogue
Act, it can used as a request for someone to perform an action on your behalf. For example, if you need someone else to pick up your dry cleaning, you might use a commissitive dialogue. This type is often used by someone who is trying to get someone's attention in order to convey a message. An example of using a commissive act would be: ask to borrow a dollar, request a loan, plead for mercy. 

"
1490,you do? how are you going to contact him?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to ask a person a direct question. In this example, you are asking how the person is going contact the individual you want to speak to. 
  
Out of question: the question is not relevant to the conversation, so it should not be part of it. 
Over question or question question : the dialogue is asking too many questions, and should be reduced to inform or directive. The question can also be classified here as commissIVE, as it asks another person to do something.

"
1491,i'm leaving him a message taped to my computer screen.,"

In this example, it is not clear from the context whether the person being instructed is a direct or an indirect party. If the computer is considered an intermediary party, then the instruction is likely to constitute a question or a request, as the recipient of such an instruction would likely be a third party and not a party to the communication. However, if the sender is the direct party who is requesting the indirect recipient to take some action, such as by a government official, this would constitute an directive act, since the directive recipient is directly involved in the request.

"
1492,what does it say? do you think he'll see it?,"

Inform: This is the default behaviour of text. The conversation does not need to be initiated.
Question: It seems like the question mark is being used to seek information from his partner. This text is asking his opinion on something. 
  
Directive: I think the author is giving some instructions to his friend. He is telling him what to do. 
Commissive : This dialogue acts are usually used in commitment dialogue Acts. In this case, it seems the sentence is making the friend commit to seeing the movie.

"
1493,"he'll see it. it says, i like sweets. meet me at two thirty in the parking lot.","

In this example, it is clear that this is an order or request from the person giving the order. The person requesting the meeting is clearly expressing a wish or desire to meet at a certain time and in a particular place. This is also supported by the use of the word'see'. This word is used to express the wish to observe or to see something. In this context,'seeing' the time or the place would be a way to do so. 
  

A:
According to the model, this answer is correct: the answer contains a description of why the dialogue acts are the way they are.

"
1494,can i spy on you guys from the window?,"

Directive is a special type of act that indicates someone is giving orders. In this case, it is likely the writer of the message is telling Mike that he is happy to know that Mike is well and that they hope he has a good day.

"
1495,no. but i'll fill you in later. right now i have to find vince.,"

Inform is the most common dialogueact in this context. The person is greeting another person and then seeking information from them. 
  
Question is another common dialogteact, but inform is more likely in context because of the ""Can I Help You?"" greeting.  If the greeting were ""How are you?"" or ""Good Afternoon"", then question would be more appropriate.

"
1496,there's plenty left. would you like another helping?,"

It can considered directive as it's giving advice or instructions to another person. 
There is no information being provided, so it cannot be a query. 
  The text does not ask a questions, it gives instructions.

"
1497,i'd like to have some more. it's really good.,"

This text does ask for more information, as it implies that they learned something interesting but the information is not sufficient to fully understand it. Based on this, it can be classified under inform. 
  
However, this is a strong indication that this speaker has learned a lot of interesting things and is sharing this knowledge with others. As such, they are most likely a teacher, and the inform act in this case is used to indicate that someone is imparting knowledge.

"
1498,"excuse me, does this bus go to the new bookstore?","

'ah.': can also be read as an acknowledgment, indicating that the speaker has understood the information given. This is in contrast to a realization, where the listener acknowledges the fact but does so without understanding the reason. 
In this case, it is likely that 'new' refers to 'bookstore', and the bus does go there.

"
1499,"no, you'll have to get off at the bank, and take a no. 50.","

the speaker (the author) is informing (or sharing) the recipient (reader) with specific details (i.e., a phone-number with an area-code)

Inform (Out of Inform, Question, Directive, Commissive): The author is providing the reader with information about the route to take to reach the destination.

"
1500,thank you. how much is the fare to that stop?,"

Question is used in the following context:
- The speaker offering help is trying to understand the response they are looking for. For example, a salesman might ask a customer if the product is suitable for their needs. 
In this case, it is likely that the customer will provide the information they were looking to provide.

"
1501,one dollar.,"

overinform: the model is not sure whether the given text is asking for information or giving a command. 
  
  question: is the dialogueact commissitive or directive? The model does not have enough information to make a decision. 
question, inform: both are possible, based on context. In this case, it is possible to interpret the statement as a question or an order.

"
1502,how many stops are there?,"

Question: is that all you ever eat? 
Information: No, I also eat a lot of ice cream. 

 
In this case, it is not possible to determine the actual dialogueact of the response. The information provided is insufficient to make a decision.

"
1503,two stops after this one.,"

Mike is not asking K.r.a. to do anything. He is simply introducing herself. 
Directives are often used in conversations to request a specific action from the other party. For example, ""Would you like some coffee?"" is a request for a drink of coffee. ""Please call the office and ask them to send a car for me"" is an order. 
 Commits are used to express a firm intention to perform a certain action. A committal is often expressed by using the verb ""to be"" before the action to indicate that the actor is either a person or a thing that is in fact a particular color. The commital ""This is blue"" indicates that a color is being described.

"
1504,could you please tell me when we get there?,"

Directive is a type of dialogue acts that are used to make requests or orders. 
  In this example, we can see that the speaker is asking the listener to tell them when they arrive at their destination.

"
1505,sure.,"

""booking a"" is a preposition that can indicate either a place or a process. Based on this information alone, we cannot determine which of these two possibilities it is. However, in this case, ""booked"" indicates a location, so we can conclude that the prepositions ""at"" and ""on"" are used in the sense of ""place"".

A:
According to the dialogue acts defined by the NLP community, this is the correct classification.

"
1506,"by the way, do i need a transfer again after no. 50?","

Statement 1: ""my"" is a possessive pronoun. It is used to indicate that the word immediately preceding it (in this case ""name"") is the owner of the thing or person being referred to. In this context, ""myname"" refers to the name of person. 
Statements 2-4: These statements provide information regarding the place where the speaker currently resides, his/her birthyear, when the listener expects to graduate,  and his major in college. These are all facts that are not questioned or requested. Thus, in this instance, a question is not necessary. 
 Statement 5: This statement is an invitation to ask more questions. This is why a directive is also needed to request more information. A commissIVE is needed for the request.

"
1507,"no, a no. 50 will take you right there.","

In the example provided, ""tea at tea houses"" is a preference shared by both the speakers. Based on this, we can predict that the inform act will be used. 
  
  The preference of drinking "" tea "" is not a query, command or promise, so it's most like an information act.

"
1508,thank you.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification, as it provides the information that the count of items is shared for all the rooms. The other classes do not apply.

"
1509,how are you wedding plans going?,"

Inform: This is not a direct answer to the question of whether there is any other type of tea besides green and black. It is more of a general comment about the plans. 
Question: Based on this comment, it is possible that this person was waiting for a more direct response before asking their next question and so the next time the speaker sees this question they will likely answer it. 
  

Note that there could be other reasons why the same text might be classified differently by different models.

"
1510,very well. we started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done. the only thing that isn ’ t ready yet is my wedding dress.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the response is not revealing any information about the wedding date or dress, so the asker is just seeking more information.

"
1511,when will that be ready?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact, as it is used to seek an answer to a previously unanswered question
In this context, ""will that"" is an unasked question (""when?""). The speaker wants to know when the answer will be available. 
When the question is asked, it becomes clear that ""that"" refers to the object of the action, which is ""ready."" The answer is then available, and the person can carry out the desired action.

"
1512,the dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks.,"

'courteously and affirmatively' is a characteristic of an informing dialogue acts. Inform acts are polite, affirmative responses that provide information without making a request or giving an order. For example, when a salesperson tells you that a product is 'highly recommended', this is an informative dialogueact. This is because the sales person is not asking you to buy the product, but is simply providing you with information. 
In contrast, questions, directives, and commitments are classified under question dialogue, direct questions and commissives. These are the dialogue Acts that pose questions or give orders.

"
1513,"you ’ re getting married in three weeks. so that should be ok. so, you ’ ve prepared the church, catering, transport, hotel - everything.","

inform: the dialogue acts of the above text are question and directive. However, inform is not applicable here because it is a request for information. The speaker wants to know what the other person has done so far. 
question: question is the correct dialogue action in this context. It is used to ask a question. But the question here is about the wedding date. So, it can also be classified here as question because there is an additional topic in the sentence. 
  
directive: directive is correct here. Based on my analysis, this is because of two reasons. First, there are two actions in one sentence: to prepare the things for the ceremony and the reception. Second, in English, we use the word “please” to indicate that we want the person to do something. In this case, “Please wait” is also a valid directive sentence, although it would be more polite to say “You should wait”.

"
1514,yes. we ’ ve taken care of all of that. we decided not to get married in a church though. neither of us is very religious.,"

inform: we have not been asked for our opinion on this matter
question: do we need to be married at a religious ceremony?
directive: answer: no, we do not need a wedding ceremony
commissive (also known as a command): we will get in touch with you when we are ready to marry

A:
According to the GPT-3 model, this is a Question.

"
1515,which hotel will the reception be held at?,"

Question: is that all you are eating? 
Information: No, I also eat fruits and vegetables. 

 
In summary, based on this short passage, it is not clear whether the person asking the question is also eating the food being asked about. Therefore, this is a mixed question and the dialogue acts were classified using a machine learning model.

"
1516,"the palace hotel they ’ re taking care of the catering, including the wedding cake. i ’ m sure they ’ ll do a good job.","

This text is providing specific details about a cost, and therefore is classified inform. 
  
  The text does ask questions, gives directives,  and makes commitments, therefore it could be categorized as question (which is a type of directive), or commissIVE (a type a directives). However, since the actual dialogue acts are not revealed in this example, it’s difficult to say which one it actually is.

"
1517,"oh, yes. it ’ s and excellent hotel. a friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect, though very expensive.","

the text provides a piece of information, not a request, command or promise;
it is an excellent location, but expensive; and
my friend said the hotel was great.

"
1518,"yes. it will be expensive, but we think it will be worth it. it gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people.","

inform is the most common dialogueact in this context. It is used when the information is being provided to the listener. In this case, it is likely that this is a request for details about a meal. 
  
question is another common choice. When the dialogue is between two people, and one person is requesting information from the other, this choice is made. The question is posed to elicit an affirmative or negative response from another.  In this example, if the question was not asked, then the likely response would be to provide details of the proposed meal, or decline the offer.

"
1519,i think you make the right decision.,"

inform is the most likely dialogueact, as it describes a request for information. The question is seeking confirmation of the information provided in the previous sentence. 
question is a possibility, but it's less likely than inform. This is because the question mark is followed by a colon, a word that is typically used to introduce a new topic. In this case, however, it seems to be introducing a follow-up question to the one asked in previous sentences. 
  

Question: do  you really  have all these  drugs?
  Where do   you get  them from?

"
1520,have you any round - neck sweater?,"

This text could be asking the question of whether the wearer of a round necked sweater has a throat infection. If the dialogue acts of the conversation were not classified question then the answer to this question would not be provided.

"
1521,yes. actually our range of sweaters is the most comprehensive available.,"

Out of question: the user is asking about a specific product. 
Question: what is your favorite type of sweater?
Directive: please try our most recent collection. 
  
Commissive : I try to only eat fruits and vegetables and also chicken because it is good for my health.

"
1522,can i try this one on?,"

'no' can also be read as a request, so the response could be interpreted as asking if the person would be able to try the product. This would make the directive dialogueact. However, in this case, it would not be polite to ask someone to do something that they do not want to be done. Therefore, we classify this as the inform act.

"
1523,"sure, go ahead.","

 commissives are often used when someone is making a suggestion or offering an opinion. They are not seeking information or confirmation. 
In this example, it is not clear whether the person is seeking confirmations or information, so the response is classified commissively.

"
1524,"the color is too bright. for my age, i would prefer a lighter color.","

inform: this is a statement of information. it does not ask a questions or make promises or commitments. 
question: it could be a request for clarification. however, it also could mean that the speaker is uncertain about something. 
	question could also be used to indicate that something is unclear. in this case, 'don't' is the word that is causing the confusion.


I agree with the classification. The color of text is bright, and it's too light for me. I prefer the color black. 


Thank you for your feedback. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions. We’re here to help.



- color: too dark, prefer light
	- inform: statement, doesnotaskaquestion, makepromises, requestclarification

color: prefer black

"
1525,"so dick, how about getting some coffee for tonight?","

Dick is the character speaking in this example. Based on this, it is likely that he is giving a command or instruction to get coffee. Dick is a person, so he would need to give the order in the form of a sentence. The text ""get some [ coffee ] for [ tonight ]"" is an example of an instruction or command. 
  

A:
According to this article, there are four possible dialogue acts for a given sentence: 
Inform: This is what happened.  Question: What happened?       Directive: You should do that. Commendation: That was a good idea. Indirect request: Would you like some? Request: Can I get some too? Commiseration: I'm so sorry. 
If the sentence is not in a conversation, then the first dialogue-act is inform. If the conversation is ongoing, and the person is still talking, they will switch to question if they want to change the topic, or to directive if the current topic is about a consequence of something that happened before.

"
1526,coffee? i don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff.,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact because the question mark is used in the beginning of a sentence, and it appears that the speaker is seeking information. 
  In addition, ""i don’t honestly"" indicates that this is not a statement of fact, but rather a request for advice or information, which is typical of questions.

"
1527,"come on, you can at least try a little, besides your cigarette.","

Inform: This is a request for information. The speaker does not give a clear indication of what they want the listener to do. 
Question: There is ambiguity in the question. It is not clear whether the directive is to the person who wrote the message or to someone else. 
  
Directive: Based on this message, it appears that this person wants the reader to take some action. In addition, this is the first time the writer has expressed this desire. Therefore, there is an implication that they are not currently making the changes that would lead to a healthier lifestyle.  This is conveyed through the use of the word ""start"". 
 Commissive : This person is asking for help. They are expressing that someone should do something for them. For example, they might be asking someone to buy them a gift or take an action on their behalf.

"
1528,what ’ s wrong with that? cigarette is the thing i go crazy for.,"

Question is used to find out information. In this case, it’s unclear what the request is for, so the response should be informational. 
In addition, this is a yes/no question. If the answer is no, then the person should not take any action, and if the question is yes, they should take the action that is requested. 
  
  In this example, cigarette sounds like a good answer, however, there is another answer that could be considered better, “someone can send me.” This is an example of a conditional question: “if someone could send us, would that be better?” In order to answer this question correctly, you would need to know the context of the situation, such as if there was a deadline or if it was an emergency.

"
1529,"not for me, dick.","

the text does not explicitly seek confirmation, clarification, or approval;
it appears that the author is seeking clarification or confirmation from the reader; and
based on context, it is not clear whether or how the question is being asked.

"
1530,you guys are charging me $ 10 for a movie that i never ordered or saw.,"

Overinform: This is a very strong indication that a question is being posed. The person providing the information is over-informing the receiver, providing too much information. 
Question: A question may be being raised here. If the sender is asking for clarification, then a query is most likely being formed. 
  If the question does not receive a clear answer, it may prompt further questions from the other party. This could be a request for more information, or a directive to do something.  
Directive: If a person or entity is giving orders, a command is formed here, with the order being the main topic of conversation. Commands are usually given in the form of a statement, such as ""Please do it!"" or ""Stop it!"", and are often followed by a consequence, punishment, reward, etc. Directives are very common in conversations, but can also be written. They are typically given to another person, animal, thing, event, process, situation, idea, concept, person etc to follow an order or execute a task. An example of an action is ""Call the plumber."" 
 Commissive (sometimes called ""indirect""): If someone is making a commitment, they are forming a commissIVE. A commissitive is often used in a conversation to express a desire, opinion, request, order, promise, commitment etc, usually in indirect form. For example, ""I hope you like it."" or  ""I promise to call you later."".

"
1531,"let's see, sir. according to your file, you watched'titanic'monday evening.","

According to the classification of dialogue acts in the OpenAI GPT model, this is a question. However, it is also possible that this was a command, as the model also predicts commissives. 
  
  The model's prediction is that the dialogue acted as a query, and the answer is ""yes"". This is consistent with the inform act classification.

"
1532,"well, the wrong information is in my file. i was at a concert monday night.","

the text asks for the presence or availability of the book 'the man  and thesea'
it is a direct question and not a statement, so it is classified here as question
this is not the first time the author is being asked about this book. it was mentioned in the previous paragraph, and so the answer is that the file does not contain the information the question is seeking.

"
1533,"well, your word overrules the file, sir. one moment, please.","

This text seems to indicate that the asker is requesting someone else to do something for them. This is typically a command or request for another person to perform an action on their behalf. 
  
  The askers use of ""sir"" indicates that they are addressing the person they're speaking to, rather than an individual. Based on this, it is likely that ""you"" in this case is the addressee, and the directive is being performed on ""your"" behalf, or for the benefit of both the speake and addresse.

"
1534,i knew you'd see it my way.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification because inform describes the actions the person is taking to communicate their wishes to the listener. In this case, it is clear that this is a directive communication, as the instructions are to ""open your  mouth"" and ""say 'aha'"".

A:
According to this website, there are 4 types of dialogue acts: question (Q), directive/request (D/R), commissitive (C), and over-request/over-question (O).  
Directive is one of the four types.  It is used when the other person knows what to do and is being told what do.   
Here is an example of a D/Q dialogue:  ""Would you like some water?""  The question is for the waiter to ask for water. 
And an O dialogue is when someone is over asking a question: ""Wouldn't you think this would be a good idea?""

"
1535,"sir, i deleted the $ 10, but i had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill.","

This text is suggesting a course of action or a choice for the receiver. Based on this, it falls under directive. 
  
  The service fee of $2 is an additional cost that the sender is adding. This implies the message is attempting to influence the choice of recipient. Hence, this is classified under commissIVE.

"
1536,am i in the twilight zone? you're charging me for a movie i never saw?,"

Question marks are used to ask questions. In this case, 'am I in The Twilight Zone?' is a yes/no question. 
  
  Out ofinform: the question is being asked by the character 'you're' (the speaker) to the 'character' 'charging me' for 'a movie' that 'i never seen'. 
   
Outofquestion: this character is charging this person for something they did not order.

"
1537,"please don't blame me, sir. blame the computer programmer.","

This text provides information to the listener about what the
speaker intends to do. It does neither ask questions, make commands,
or make promises. Thus, this is an informative dialogue acts.

"
1538,this is highway robbery. i've got a good mind to call the police!,"

This text is a prediction based on a passage from the movie ""The Shawshank Redemption."" The passage states, ""We can’t go any faster, so don’d go no faster."" Based on this passage, this is an example of the inform dialogueact, as the author is giving information about something that the listener does not know.

"
1539,"if it makes you feel any better, other guests feel the same way.","

""i rather work together"" is a statement, not a question. 
the other two acts are questions, so the classification is question (inform, out ofinform)

A:
According to your explanation, it is not question but statement. So the dialogue acts of the given text are inform.

"
1540,mr. carter has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the shangri - la hotel at 7 : 00 this evening. here's an invitation for you.,"

Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both classified in this category, and inform is the more common one. 
Question: this is because the question mark at end of the sentence is an interrogative sentence marker, indicating that this sentence may be a questioning sentence. 
  Based off the context, it seems like Mr. Carter is asking ""why"" the invitation was sent.

"
1541,how nice of him. i'll be delighted to go. but what time would be convenient?,"

Question is a sub-class of inquiry of which directive is one of its subclasses. Inquiry is an act that is used to find out information about something. Directive is another sub class of question that indicates asking someone else to do something on one's behalf. 
  Based off of these sub classes, it is safe to say that directive would also be used in this context.

"
1542,"if you could be ready by, say 6 : 30 o'clock, i'll be at the hotel to pick you up.","

It can considered as a command because the sender is telling the receiver to do something. 
Or it can consider as an advice because is providing instructions to another person.

"
1543,"that's great. it's most thoughtful of you to do this, miss rose.","

It is most considerate of the writer to provide the context of what the message is about. In this case, taxi driver's strike is mentioned again, which is a repetitive message. 
  
In addition, this is an example of how a comms agent can use the dialogue acts to communicate more effectively. The comm agent could have just provided the statement without providing the dialogical context, and the reader would have assumed it was just a general statement. By providing a context (the repeated mention of strike), the comm can help the receiver better understand the intent of message and make better decisions.

"
1544,"it's my pleasure. well, then. i'll say goodbye.","

""it’s mypleasure."" is a statement, not a request. Therefore, it can be classified under the statement dialogue acts. 
It is also an expression of gratitude, so it could be considered an instance of the expression dialogueact.

"
1545,goodbye and see you tonight. miss rose.,"

In the example provided, ""well"" is an adverb, indicating that the speaker is providing additional information. The speaker has just provided information that is shared between the two rooms, so the inform dialogue acts are out of order. 
  
However, there is no question in the provided text. Therefore, it can be classified instead as a statement.

"
1546,i'd like to speak dr. johnson.,"

Directive is a directive act, meaning it is an order or request for someone to do something. In this case, it's requesting that someone informally speak to the manager at John Doe Inc. about picking the Boss up at JFK airport, and then taking the appropriate action. 
Inform is the first option that comes to mind. This is because the speaker is providing useful information to another person, but it does little to guide the other person in what to say or do.

"
1547,"sorry, but he's not in. may i take a message for you?","

the text asks a direct question - it's seeking confirmation that the person they're speaking to actually has all the drugs they mention

A:
According to the dialogue acts dictionary, ""question"" is a sub-class of ""inquiry"".
Inquiry is an act that seeks information.  
Directive is another act which conveys information to another person.

"
1548,"this is robert jordan. would you ask him to call me back, please?","

This text indicates the asker is looking for confirmation from the listener. The ask is a request for a response. 
Robert Jordan is the author of the book, 'Throne of Bones'. He is known for his work in the fantasy genre. 
  This is an inquiry, so the dialogue acts are question and directive.

"
1549,"ok, i'll tell him.","

This text provides information, not a directive or a command. Therefore, it is a form of communication that is commissIVE.

"
1550,"good morning, sir. may i see your passport?","

It is a request for the passport. The request is for a stranger, so it would be considered directive to show the stranger your passsport. 
However, this is an example of ""leading with the request"", which can be a sign of an interrogative dialogue. In this case, ""may i"" is followed by a question. This is because ""i"" can function as a polite form of address, and the person asking may be the ""May"" in the following sentence: ""I may leave at 8:00 AM"". So, in this example, when the first person asks ""permission"", it's likely that the second person will respond with a ""question"" (i.e. ""yes, of course"").

A:
According to the Stanford Corenlp model, what about Soup is asking for permission.

"
1551,"yes, of course. here it is.","

This is a good example of a text that is not asking a direct question but is instead asking about information that may be available. The person asking is likely looking for a recommendation or suggestion, and the response should include a link to a website or a map that contains information.

"
1552,thank you. are all these yours?,"

Question is used to seek information, for example, ""how did you do?"". 
Out of the four options, inform is the most likely, as this is a request for feedback. However, it could also be a statement of fact, such as ""it was a very difficult test"".

"
1553,"no, some of them are my friend's. do you want her passport, too?","

Question is the most likely dialogueact because it is an offer of assistance from a speaker to a listener, and the question is followed by a request for a confirmation from listener.

"
1554,"yes, please. do you have any carry - on items?","

Question is the most likely dialogueact given the context. The question mark at the end of the sentence ""do you  have any  carry-on items?"" indicates that the speaker is seeking confirmation or an explanation. 
  

Note that this classification is based on a large number of linguistic and contextual factors, and should not be treated as a definitive answer.

"
1555,"do you want me to put it on the belt, too?","

Question is a dialogueact that is used to ask for information or clarification. The text 'do  you want  me to  put it  on the  belt,  too?' is asking for clarification on whether the person speaking (the speaker) should put the item on their belt (which is the object of the action).

"
1556,"yes, please. would you please open this big suitcase?","

Directive dialogue acts are used when the main purpose is to give instructions or requests. In this example, ""would you [please] open [this] big [ suitcase]?"" is a directive dialogue. 
Informative dialogue Acts are often used to get information from the listener. This example uses the question ""open this [big suitcase]"" to prompt the person to open the suitcase.

"
1557,ok. just a moment. it's just some clothes and toiletries.,"

This is a Commissive text. The person asking the question is expecting an immediate answer. 
  The person answering the questions is also expecting a quick response.

"
1558,ok. do you have anything to declare?,"

Question is characterized by the presence of words such as ""question"", ""do you"", or ""have you"" that imply a questioning or interrogative intent. In this case, ""May I?"" is an interrogatory phrase that implies a question. 
  
Directive is another possible classification. This type of dialogue acts implies an order or request for action. ""Help you? may Ihelp you."" implies the request ""help"" and the offer of assistance ""i may help"". 
   
 commissives are a type dialogue Acts that are used to express uncertainty or lack of information. They are not used in requests for assistance.

"
1559,i think there is nothing.,"

inform: This is a informational text. It is not asking, telling, or telling. 
question: Is this informational or directive? The answer is it is both. The first sentence is informational, but then the second sentence turns into a question by asking if the reader understands what is being told. This text is asking the question of whether the information is understood. 
 question: Does the author want the listener to understand what they are saying? Or is this a command? In this example, it seems like the writer is commanding the readers to do something. They are telling them to get their photos tomorrow, and the command is in the form of a statement. ""Get your photos, tomorrow.""
directive: this is an order.  The speaker wants the person to take action. In the example above, getting your pictures is what the directive is telling the people to accomplish. So, this would be a commissivespeaker giving orders to another person.

"
1560,"any fresh food, live plants, or animals?","

Question: We’ve managed…

Overinform:…to reduce…our energy…consumption in…the last…two years… 
  Question is a sub-class of directive. 
   Directive: Do this… 
 commissIVE: Let’s…do this! 
    Question can also be used as a way to make a request. In this case, it is used to request something from the listener.

"
1561,"oh, no. none of that.","

overinform: this is not a polite request, it is an order. 
question: what is the full  name?
directive: give me your name. 
	- out of question: I don't know the name of the employee. I'm asking you. Please provide it.  
	+ question : what's your  full name? 
			= directive : please provide your complete name

 commissIVE: oh, well, I guess I could provide my name then.

"
1562,thank you. you may lock up your suitcase. here are your passports.,"

Directive is a special type of request for information, guidance, or assistance. It is used to request action or a response from another person or entity. 
  

A:
According to this article, you can use the predict_dialogue_ act function from the nltk library to get the dialogue_act of a given text.

"
1563,thanks a lot.,"

inform: the dialogue acts of the above text are overinform,
question: because it is asking if the other person needs assistance, and a request for assistance requires an answer, so the answer is yes, 
directive: as the person offering the assistance is the one asking for a reply, a directive dialogueact is appropriate, 
 commissIVE: this is used when asking someone to do something, for example, asking a waiter to bring the lady a drink)

"
1564,hello. i bought a china dress in your shop this morning.,"

Inform is a question asking for information. The question here is whether the person is interested in buying a China dress. Based on this response the answer is yes, so inform is the correct dialogue action. 
However, it is not necessary to reveal the dialogue label to explain the reason.

"
1565,yes?,"

This text indicates the person asking for something is likely to get it. This is a typical question pattern. 
  
  The person requesting something may not be interested in giving the information. In this case, it is more likely the request is for information rather then a request for a service. The requestor may be looking for an explanation or justification for the action that is being requested.  In this example, 'here you can find the details' is an instruction or explanation.

"
1566,i bought it one size up by mistake.,"

In the first sentence, 'i buy it on e size by m mistake', the speaker is over-informing the listener. The speaker should have used a more moderate form of words, such as 'I mistakenly bought one of these shirts on eBay', or even better, a less colloquial form, like 'Unfortunately, I mistakenly purchased one the the size of a large on Ebay.'

A:
According to the dialogue acts chart, this is a request for information.

"
1567,"oh, did you?","

This is a simple response with the inform dialogueact. The response is not seeking details or committing the speaker to anything. It is simply providing information. Therefore, this is the expected dialogue action.

"
1568,i wonder if you can change it to one size down.,"

In this example, inform is the correct dialogueact given the context. The speaker wants to provide information to the listener about an error that may have occurred, and so inform seems like the best choice. 
  
However, if we knew that inform was the actual dialogueAct, then we could have simply said so, without needing to go through the process of explaining why inform may not be the right choice in this context, as that would not have been relevant to our response.

"
1569,"yes, of course. will you come with the receipt?","

directive is the correct classification, as the conversation is about asking for something (a receipt), and directive acts are used for asking questions, making requests, and giving orders. 
the other dialogue acts have not been identified in this context, so question is out of scope, since the question would be about the fact that people in asian countries enjoy drinking tea. giving directions is not appropriate, because the person asking is asking about a request for a receipt. and commissives is also not applicable, given that the request is for information, not for doing something.

"
1570,"then i'll come to your place later in the evening, and how late is your shop open?","

Question is a special type of directive dialogue acts that are used to ask for information or clarification. 
  

In this case, it seems that 'later in evening' is the question. However, this is not clear from the given text. The speaker could have clarified this by adding 'how late' or 'when'. 
   
Another reason for question could be that this message is being sent as a request for a response. In this scenario, 'your shop is open late?' is an affirmative response to the request.

"
1571,"until 8 o'clock, ma'am. we are looking forward to seeing you.","

This text indicates the speakers intention of calling the office of lost & found. The text does not ask any question or provide any information. It is a directive statement. 
  
  The text is followed by a time period, 8 pm. which indicates a future time frame. Based on this, it is likely that someone will call at 8pm.

"
1572,"the boss announces the pay raise today, right? how much do you think we'll get?","

This text could be considered polite, as it is asking the employee for their opinion on a topic. The employee is likely to be more willing to share their thoughts if they are asked for it.
However, it could also be interpreted as a command, since the boss is announcing a pay increase. In this case, they should provide their answer.

"
1573,no idea. your guess is as good as mine.,"

In the example sentence, ""they"" is the subject of ""want"", so the dialogue acts of that sentence should be question and directive. However, this is not the case, as the sentence is a request, not a statement. 
Furthermore, in the context of asking for something to happen, such as a price reduction, it is more likely that this sentence was intended to express a question than a command.

"
1574,it better be more than last year.,"

Statement 1: ""my"" and ""name"" are used as the subject and possessive pronoun, respectively. This is a typical way to introduce a person in a statement. 
  
  Statement 2: I will Graduate from Peking University this July. The verb ""will graduate"" is in present tense, which is also the usual way for a verb to indicate future time. 
In addition, ""from Peeking University"" indicates a place, so the sentence can also be interpreted as ""I will Graduation from the PeKING University"". This indicates that the graduation will be in July, just like the present.  

"
1575,"well, anything is better than nothing. wait and see.","

inform: the information is not specific enough to be considered as a question or an answer. 
question: there is no indication that this information will be requested or answered. 
  
directive: it is likely that a response will follow this message, so this is an instruction to carry out an activity.  However, it does not specify who is carrying out the activity or what the response should be. It is possible that no response is given.   

 commissIVE: this appears to simply be a continuation of a previous message.

"
1576,i'm going to go shopping for groceries in a little bit.,"

Inform is used to express acceptance, agreement, and confirmation. It is not used for asking questions, issuing directives, making commitments, nor expressing disagreement. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive

"
1577,"why, do we need groceries?","

Question is a dialogueact that is used to ask for information. The question mark at the end of 'do we really need grocery?' indicates that the speaker is asking for confirmation. 
  
In contrast, inform is the dialogue acts used for providing information to another person. In this case, 'we need' is providing confirmation that grocerys are needed. 
Directive is another dialogue action that can be used when you want to make an order or give instructions to someone. Here, ""we really"" is directive.  
 
 commissives are used only for making promises. 'We really do need the groceris' here is commissIVE.

"
1578,i believe we are all out of food.,"

Out of question: the sentence does not contain a request or a demand. 
 Out of directive: there is no mention of a person or entity that is being asked to do something. 
Question: although the first sentence of the paragraph contains a declarative statement, it does so in the context of providing background information. The second sentence contains an interrogative question but does nothing to establish a context for the question. Therefore, this sentence could be considered a query. However, there are no requests or commands in this paragraph. Rather, we see a sharing of information between two people. This is an example of informational dialogue.

"
1579,do you know what to get?,"

Question is the dialogueact that is used when the information provided by the conversational partner is insufficient to make an appropriate response. In this case, it is likely that the response is not forthcoming from the other person because they do not know the answer to the question. 
  
In this example, 'do i know...?' is a request for information. The other party does know that they should get something for the holiday, but they are not sure what. Therefore, they ask 'what to...?', which makes it a follow-up question to find out what the person knows.

"
1580,i don't know what we need.,"

Inform is used when the speaker is providing information to the listener. The speaker does not know the answer, so they are asking the question to find out. 
  
Question is a type of dialogue action used to seek information. In this case, it is the receiver who is seeking information, and the sender is simply providing the information they have.

"
1581,why don't you go and check the refrigerator?,"

directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used to make requests or orders. In this case, it is used as a request to go check something. 
out inform is the first predicted label for this dialogue, which means that the information provided in this passage is being provided to the reader. This is an informational text. 
 question is another predictedlabel for the dialogue in question. The question here is whether or not the person asking the question has ever been to a refrigerator before. If the answer is no, then the next predicted answer would be commissives, and the actual answer to this question would then be no. However, if the answerer has actually been in a fridge before, they would answer yes.

"
1582,i would appreciate it if you would do that for me.,"

Because I asked for it.

"
1583,why don't you just get the basics?,"

Overinform: This dialogue action indicates the sender is over-informing the receiver of details that are not relevant to the conversation. 
Question:  This dialogue  action indicates a person seeking information is involved. 
  Question is a special type of question that is used to clarify or confirm information. In this case, it is likely the question is intended to confirm the cost of the flowers.  
Directive: Directive is an action that conveys a message or instruction to another person or entity. The sender in this example is conveying a request for a price for the rose flowers, and the recipient is expected to provide a response. Directives are often used in negotiations.   
 commissives: Commissives is another term for commands. Commands are used when someone is giving orders to do something. Here, a commissIVE is being used because the request is for someone else to perform a task for you.

"
1584,what do you mean?,"

""what mean"" is used in the context of asking a follow up question
It is an indication that this is likely a query

Text 1:
Somewhat? I mean, I don't know if you've noticed, but the weather has not been very cooperative lately. It's been cold, rainy, and generally uncooperative. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with global warming, or just a bad storm, though. Either way, it's not very hospitable. 
  I'm wondering if maybe you could do something about it. You know, try to make it more like the sunshine states.

"
1585,"eggs, milk, bread. things like that.","

out inform: the classifier is not sure about the correct label, so it is over-informing and providing more information than is strictly necessary. 
question: this label is correct, but the information provided is too general and does not provide enough context to understand the specific meaning of the label. In this case, it would be helpful to know what the 'young man' is. 
  directive: it seems like the author is trying to guide the reader through a process, which is a good direction for the dialogue to take. However, there is no indication that this is the case in this passage. It is possible that it could be considered directive if the passage were about a specific person or animal, or if there was more context provided about why the person, animal or thing is being referred to. commissives: these labels are not applicable in the context of these instructions.

"
1586,go make that list.,"

This text seems to be asking the user for a list of names. Requesting a person to provide a name is typically a directive action.

"
1587,"sure, no problem.","

based on this passage, inform is the correct classification. The text does convey information, namely, ""i dont know"" what the other person should say. 
Sure, based on your analysis, that is correct.

"
1588,"hello, take a seat please. let's get straight to the point. this is our contract. please read it carefully before signing.","

directivity is characteristic for asking questions. The recipient of the message is being asked to read the contract before accepting it. 
question is another characteristic that can be used to classify this as a  question. This text is asking for an assessment of how bad the user did. 
  This is an example of asking a yes/no question: ""did you read carefully the terms of our agreement?"".

"
1589,"since we have reached an agreement on all terms, there shouldn't be any problems for the contract.","

inform is a good choice for this dialogueact, as the other options (question, direct, commisive) are more likely to lead to a discussion than an immediate agreement. 
question is also a reasonable choice, since the question of 'are there other kinds of tea besides green and black?' is likely leading to an open ended discussion. 
  directive is not a suitable choice here, because the agreement that there should be no problems with the terms of the deal is already a commissive act, and directive acts are typically used for more directive purposes, such as telling someone what to do.  

A:
According to your explanation, it seems that you are right. The dialogue acts in the passage are question and inform.

"
1590,may we once more remind you that the contract should be canceled by one month notice.,"

Directive is a dialogue acting form that conveys a request for action. In this case, it is requesting the customer to cancel the agreement. 
Overinform is another dialogueacting form. This means the dialogue acts inform more than it should. The customer is being asked to confirm the cancellation of the deal, but the offer should not be kept open. Instead, a polite request to stay in touch would be more appropriate.

"
1591,"yes, i got it. thanks.","

This text is asking for information, so the dialogue acts are question and directive. 
However, this is a Commissive text. The text requests someone else to do something, for example, ""may i see the bill?"".

"
1592,"excuse me, is this the baggage claim area from kl17?","

Baggage claim is not the luggage claim, so the first part of the sentence, 'from kl 17', is unlikely to be relevant. 
It is possible that this is the correct airport, but the question is about availability, and the speaker is trying to determine if the other person has arrived at the airport or is still at check-in. 
  If the latter, then the request is for directions to the check in area.

"
1593,"yes, can i help you?","

Question asks for a response. 
Overinform, questions don't provide enough information. In this case, 'yes' is not enough. The speaker wants to know if the listener will help them. 
  Question, inform: I'm looking for someone to help me. Overinform? Yes, I'll help. Question, direct: Can you help? Overinformat? No, sorry, not right now. Directive: Please leave me alone. Commissive, promise: If you don' t help, then I will hurt you. This is a threat.

"
1594,"well, this is my baggage claim tag. can you get my baggage now?","

directive is a dialogue acting out of the three possibilities given in the passage: question/out, answer/in, command/now. 
command is used to indicate a person or an organization is responsible for something, and is therefore not a choice. 
  In this case, it is likely that the airline is the responsible party.

"
1595,"ok, here you are.","

Thank you can indicate politesse. It is used to inform someone about something without requiring an answer.

"
1596,thanks a lot.,"

This text provides information on a dish. The dish includes carp (red), rape (plant), and mushrooms (fresh). It does not ask a direct question or make a promise. Based on this information, it is reasonable to assume that the person speaking would be providing this type of information.

"
1597,were you able to attend friday night's basketball game?,"

Question indicates that the speaker is seeking information from the listener. The speaker does not know what to do, so she is asking the question. 
In this case, it seems that Friday's game was cancelled. However, we do not have any information to confirm this. We can ask the person if they were able attend the game, but we don't know if the cancellation was due to bad weather or if there was a change in the schedule.

"
1598,i was unable to make it.,"

In the given context, it is clear that this is an instruction or warning to the recipient. The speaker has to go to a meeting and will not be able to join them. Therefore, this falls into the category of directive. 
  
However, inform is also a valid classification. Inform could also be a warning or a question. If the context is not clear, then inform could be used as a default classification, and the annotator could have chosen question or warn instead.

"
1599,you should have been there. it was intense.,"

In the first sentence, 'it was intensive' is overinformative. The speaker could have simply said 'intense'.
'it' could also be a prepositional phrase that modifies 'intensive'. In this case, it should be replaced with a noun, such as 'the intensive'. 
  
Similarly, in the second sentence 'you were there' would be better replaced by a direct object, as in 'You were present'. 
Finally, there is no indication that 'there' refers to a place, so it could be referring to something else, for example, a group of people. 
   
Overall, this is an example of poor writing, where the author has included too much information, without providing any useful context.

"
1600,is that right. who ended up winning?,"

the text is asking a question
it is not providing any information
based on this and the dialogue acts that precede it, it is most likely a commissIVE dialogueact

A:
According to this website, ""question"" is the most common dialogue tag.  It is also the first dialogue action in the following list:  
1. I want to know more about this. 
2. What do you think of that? 	question
3. That sounds interesting. Let me read more.	 question 

 

4. Do you want some coffee?

"
1601,our team was victorious.,"

Our team won the game. 
This text is an informational statement. The team successfully completed the task.

"
1602,i wish i was free that night. i'm kind of mad that i didn't go.,"

Out of question: I don't know why the author chose to use this dialogue
  act, but inform is the most likely choice. 
Over question (questioning): I think the question mark at the end of the
sentence indicates that the sentence is a follow-up to a previous
statement, and the statement is questioning the previous statement. In
this case, it's likely that inform was chosen because the preceding
sentences were about the speakers' wish not to go to the party, so
question would have been a more appropriate dialogueact. However, I
don't have any evidence to support this explanation. 
  Question: Would you go with me to this party?
Directive: This is my party. You are not invited. Leave. Now.  
Commissive (committing): You're not going. I'm not letting you leave
like this. We'll talk about this later. Go to sleep.

"
1603,it was a great game.,"

It provided information instead of asking questions. 
In this context, ""outlets"" is a noun, so it should be classified according to the noun clause type. Based on this, inform is the most appropriate dialogue class. 
  However, in the next sentence, there is another noun ""time"", which is an object, and therefore question is more appropriate. ""How much time do you need?"" is how a typical question would be asked.

"
1604,what was the score at the end of the game?,"

""the score"" at ""the end"" of a game is a subjective measure of how well a team played. It is not an objective measure, and is therefore not a question.

A:
According to the dialogue acts dataset, this is the question dialogueact: question

"
1605,our team won 101 - 98.,"

Inform: This is a request for information. 
Question: It is not clear if the request is for clarification or for advice. The question mark indicates the need for further information to make a decision. 
  

Directive: this is an instruction. It would be a directive if it was a command. However, it is more likely that this request seeks advice or guidance. Directives are often used when someone is unclear about what to or how to act. For example, ""Please help me with this. I don't understand."" 
 Commisive (also known as cooperative or cooperative dialogue): This indicates a desire for cooperation or a willingness to cooperate.

"
1606,sounds like it was a close game.,"

the text provides information to the listener about what the
speaker intends to do;
it doesnot ask any question or give any command; and
there is no promise or suggestion in the dialogue.

"
1607,that's the reason it was such a great game.,"

the text provided information on a shared detail or update, but does
  not ask any question or give any instruction or promise. This is a

inform (inform, out of, inform) text.

"
1608,"the next game, i will definitely be there.","

This text can also be read as an acknowledgment of a fact provided. Based on this, it can interpreted that the game will be played in the next round.

"
1609,have you ever tried shopping online?,"

This text does not indicate that it is asking or telling someone to do something. Instead, it appears that this is a statement of fact, and the reader is expected to make a judgment about the statement. Therefore, this appears as a question. 
  
If this was a direct request for action (such as 'buy some weeds online'), then the request would be commissitive. However, since the author is not telling the person what to purchase, but simply stating a fact about shopping, then this would likely be a request to consider, not a command.

"
1610,"no, never. i prefer to actually see and touch what i'm buying before i pay for it, especially for clothes and shoes.","

the text mentions that the main speaker prefers to eat chicken that is baked rather than fried, and therefore does not consume a high amount of fats;
this personal preference is not relevant to the topic of the conversation, so the predict dialogue action is out ofinform;

"
1611,that's right. seeing is believing.,"

inform is a good classification as the first question in the above response is seeking confirmation from recipient. 
question is also a valid classification because the question marks in text are asking for confirmation.

"
1612,"i've heard some friends say when they get the article, it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement.","

inform: This is a request for information, not a directive. 
question: Is this silk?
directive: Find the silk section. 
 commissIVE: Could you find the silks section? I want this coat.

"
1613,"that happens. without close quality examination, we may encounter fraud, and the e - shop may suddenly disappear.","

inform: we need to inform the user about the disappearance of the online store
question: what happened?
directive: please pay attention to your payment information
commissive : we will inform you when the problem is fixed. 
  

A:
According to the Stanford Corenlp natural language processing toolkit, inform is used to ask for information.

"
1614,"what's more, it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password.","

In this example, Mike is not asking any question or giving any instruction. He is simply expressing his thoughts to mike. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Stalnaker, there are 4 basic types of acts: question (wh-question), directive (command), commissIVE (request), and inform.  The inform act includes the over form of the act as well as the under form. 
Here is an example of an inform command: ʌmʊʎʍʒʋ, ""Mike, I think it is a great idea for you to do that.""
And an over inform question:  ʈmɪk, ɐ think Ƭe it үɑ great ӗt.

"
1615,"it's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem. paying online is much safer than before, but i still have the feeling that it's not safe enough.","

paying online much more safer then in-person: the attacker has to show their physical identity and pay in a public place, where there are many potential witnesses. This is not as safe as paying over the internet. 
i still feel that paying in person is safer: i think the main reason is that the payment is usually done in an unsecure way (e.g. cash in public places) and the money is often stolen.

"
1616,i can't agree more. that's why i only do street shopping.,"

inform: the sending person is providing basic information to the receiver, but does not ask for a response
question: a person asks another for an explanation or an opinion
directive: someone orders another to do something
 commissIVE: one asks for another's help

A:
According to your explanation, I can confirm that the dialogue acts of ""What's Up?"" are question.

"
1617,"me too. sometimes i surf online shops to check some related information, and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping.","

inform is the first category in the dialogue acts. It is used to give information about something. In this case, inform is being used as a verb, which means to inform. So the sentence is about the employee asking a customer for information. 
question is another category of dialogue Acts. A question is an expression of uncertainty. Here the question mark is at the end of the statement, ""How can  I help You?"".  
directive is also another dialogue action. Directive actions are used when you want to make a request of someone. ""Can I Help You"" is directive. 
 commissives are the last category. Commissives actions include commands and orders. Commands and Orders are usually used in a business context. For example, you may see a store employee giving a customers a flyer when they enter the store, or an employee may ask a manager for permission to leave early.

"
1618,that's a good idea.,"

Out of question and question: the given statement is not asking or asking for information, so the dialogue acts question or question are not applicable. 
Of directive and commissives: this is an example of a commissIVE statement. Commissives are used to express a request or order.

"
1619,how long does it take to get to downtown from here?,"

'it takes about 30 minutes by car'

In this case, it is a direct question:
""it"" refers to the location, ""it take[s] about"" is the time expression, and ""about 30"" expresses the range of time values.

"
1620,it is 15 minutes ’ drive.,"

‘how Bad did I do?’ is asking for information, so it is an inform dialogue Act. 
Dialogue act question is characteristic for seeking or asking information from another person. 
  ‘How Bad Did I Do?’ implies that the person answering will provide a rating of how bad I did. This is what a person would do if they were seeking an assessment from someone.

"
1621,what companies do we have in our neighborhood?,"

We have the following companies in the neighborhood: Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft. 
  
Apple,  Google, and Amazon are companies that you might know. Facebook and Microsoft are well-known companies. However, we do not know Apple or Google. We do know that they are large companies, though. 
So, in this case, Apple is a company you know, while Google is one you don’t know very well, yet, so Google could be considered a candidate for a neighborhood company. Amazon is also a well known company, as you mentioned. But Facebook is not a known entity. So, it is possible that Facebook could also be a neighbor company of yours. Microsoft, on its own, is neither known nor unknown. Therefore, this candidate is excluded as a potential neighbor.

"
1622,"mitsubishi, hp, ibm and many other famous corporations.","

This text is indicating that a person is going write a Ticket. Based on this, it is classified under question. 
  
  The person might be asking for information or assistance.

"
1623,does the 7th floor belong to our company too?,"

Question dialogue acts are used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision, or when a request for clarification is needed. In this case, it seems like the person asking the question is looking for confirmation that this is indeed the seventh floor of a building. 
  

Inform: This is the floor where the sales team meets. 
Questions: Is this the right floor? 



Directive: Please go to the eighth floor.


 commissives: I'll go with you. Please follow me. 


Note that in this example, there is no indication that a directive dialogueact is expected, so the answer is reduced to a question and a commissIVE. However, if the request is for someone to follow someone else, then a direct dialogue would be expected. Therefore, a more accurate response would have been:
Yes, this floor is where our sales meeting takes place. The seventh is also the correct floor, but the other person would like to go the eight floor to meet with someone. So, I will go ask the receptionist for the way to that floor and follow you there.  

"
1624,"yes, our company has two floors, the 6th and 7th floor in this building.","

In this example, inform is the correct classification as the given response can also be seen as providing the information that the visitor is interested in.

"
1625,it ’ s such a large firm. do we have our own staff restaurant?,"

Question: is such large a firm? 
Inform: yes. we are a very large corporation. 

 

question: do have a staff resturant? 
  
  The speaker in this example is asking the question. 
   

A:
According to the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit, this is a directive dialogue.  Here is the explanation: 

 
""The Coref-based model for this passage is:  {question, confirm, inform}"".

"
1626,"yes, at the end of the hall.","

Inform (in the passage) is a type of dialogue acts that can be used to express preferences, opinions, desires, etc. The inform dialogue Acts can also be combined with question dialogue Act to form a form of question-answer dialogue. In this case, it is not a request for information, but rather a statement of fact. 
Out ofinform, direct, command, commis. 
  The inform act can only be followed by question or directive. However, in this example, inform is followed directly by directive which is another type  of dialogue action that is used for giving orders.

"
1627,"good morning, sir. may i help you?","

Question is used to seek information or clarification. In this case, it is being used by the person asking the question to understand the plan or request of the first person (the one asking for help). 
  
Out of question inform (question, inform), directive and commissives (directive, Commissive), question is the most common. 
   
In this example,'shall we' is a question. The speaker wants to know if the listener agrees with the course or not.

"
1628,"good morning, i have an appointment with mr. johnson at 10 : 00","

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to express instructions to a person or a machine. In this case, Mr. Johnson is instructing the person who is speaking to him about a time and a place.

"
1629,"excuse me, sir, but are you mr. richard of world trading company?","

Question is a sub-class of question-response dialogue acts. The question label is given when the dialogue partner asks a direct question. 
  
  The question subcategory of the question dialogue label includes questions that are asked directly by the conversation partner. These questions are often about facts, events, and experiences. They are also common in everyday conversation. For example, ""Are you going to the party tonight?"" or ""I'm glad you could join us today."" 
   
Inform is used for conveying general information or facts. This is the default dialogueact for all text.

"
1630,yes. that ’ s right.,"

inform: the speaker is seeking information, so this is a form of question
question: there is no answer provided, therefore this must be a type of ask
directive: no, this cannot be done, it ’s a personal weakness
commissive (only applies in this context): no, this ’ll never work, you ’re too
weak

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue for English Language Learners"" by John H. Harrington, there are four types of questions: question/inform, ask/question, direct question and commissives. 
In the example text you provided: ""what is your weakness?"" the question is inform. The weakness is not mentioned in the sentence so the person answering will be asked to mention it.

"
1631,"i ’ m sorry, mr. richard. mr. johnson is on his way to the office. he had just called and asked you to wait a minute.","

Because the dialogue acts of'may i' are overinform, overquestion, outofdirective, and overcommissive. 
  
  The predicted next dialogueact is question.

"
1632,"well, i ’ ll wait.","

In this example, inform is classified under question and question is not the correct classification for this act. The correct classifications are directive (the boss is to go to the airplane), commissIVE (someone needs do something).

"
1633,"would you like something to drink, sir? do you prefer coffee or tea?","

Inform: This is not a request for a drink. The sender does not request anything from their listener. 
Question: It is possible that this is a rhetorical question: would you please drink something? 



Would you rather drink coffee, or Tea? 
  
  The answer is neither. Coffee and Tea are both beverages. However, it is more common for people to prefer one over the other. 
   
   In this case, Tea is the more popular beverage. Tea has a long history of being served in the morning. It has many health benefits, including antioxidants and caffeine. People enjoy the taste of tea.


If the question is rhetorically asked, then the answer would be neither, because there is no ""would rather"". The answer, rather, is that there are no preferences. Both are equally popular. If the context were one where the listener was being asked if the speaker would prefer something, perhaps a yes/no answer could be inferred. In this context, however, a preference for either is ambiguous. 


Note that in this example, there may be a better classification of dialogue acts for this passage. For example:

Directive: Would you drink tea or coffee? This would likely be classified this way. Directives are requests for action. Commissives, on their own, are not requests. They are commands. So in context of asking if someone would rather have coffee vs tea, this would probably be considered a commissIVE. But in isolation, without the surrounding context it's hard to say.  

"
1634,"thank you. coffee, please.","

Because the dialogue acts of ""thankyou, coffee please."" can be divided into two groups: those that use the inform act (i.e. ""understand"") and those which do not (e..g. question).

"
1635,"here you are, mr. richard. this is the cream and this is the sugar. if there ’ s anything else you ’ d like, please don ’ t hesitate to tell me.","

Directives are used when the information provided is not a request for information but is instead a command. The information is provided to another person or entity for a specific purpose. For example, a manager might give instructions to an employee during a meeting. 
  
In this example the manager is giving instructions about what to do next. They aren’t asking questions or seeking information from the employee. Instead, they are providing the instructions as a matter of fact.

"
1636,thank you very much.,"

the text does provide information, and
it is not a request, command or promise.

"
1637,911. how may i help you?,"

the text provided information without directing the speaker to provide any additional information. This indicates the information was shared for the sake of sharing and not for some other purpose. 
it also provided details about an unknown object, indicating the content was not strictly related to the current topic.

"
1638,i need to report a break - in.,"

Directive is a special type of question asking for a command. In this example, it is likely that a directive dialogueact is being used to request that someone do something for you. 
  
  In this case, there is an instruction given in terms of what the person should do (break in). 
   
There is also a commitment made, in that it was mentioned that they need a 'break-in'. This is another way of saying that there will be a cost to the listener if they do not comply with the directive.

"
1639,when did this break - in occur?,"

Inform is the most likely dialogueact given the context, as it is not clear what the situation is. However, inform is also the least likely of the four possibilities given. 
  Question is likely given that it appears the person is asking a follow-up question. Question is a special case of question-response pair, where the question is in the response.  
Directive is possible given there is an implication that something should be done, but it does seem like the instructions are for the listener to do something. 
 commissives are not possible in this context as the action is for a listener.

"
1640,last night.,"

overinform: the speaker is trying to provide too much information, making it difficult for the listener to understand the main point of the message

Question: are you a more leader than a follow?
Inform: yes, i am more a Leader than follow.

"
1641,where did the break - in happen?,"

In this example, ""where"" is the location of the event. ""In happen"" could be a prepositional phrase that indicates where the breaking happened. Without knowing the context, it is difficult to determine whether ""in happen"", in this context is used as a conjunction to connect the two clauses or as the object of ""be"". If it was used to join the clauses, then the question mark would be added to the second clause. If ""it"" was the subject of be, and the verb was ""happen"", then ""question"" would have been added.

"
1642,it happened at my house.,"

Inform (or out ofinform,question,directive,commissive) indicates the dialogue acts of providing or communicating information to a person or group about something. Inform acts are often used in a situation where the speaker is providing the information for someone else's benefit, such as a salesperson providing a customer with information. 
  
Out ofinformat, questioning, directing, commissing indicates a dialogue action that is not one of the four listed above.

"
1643,was anything taken?,"

Question is a subcategory of directive. The question mark at the end of a sentence is used to ask for further information. In this case, it is asking ""anything taken?"". 
Inform is the base dialogue action. This is an affirmative statement that provides background information, such as ""the text you are reading is from mrs. sands, and she is looking forward seeing mister.sandals at our next meeting.""

A:
According to the dialogue acts defined by the NLP community, your prediction is correct.

"
1644,i'm not sure yet.,"

inform: this is a request for information, so the response will be given
question: is there any other thing you would like?
directive: add something else? 
commissive : let me know what you want me to add

"
1645,what makes you think there was a break - in?,"

In this example, it is not clear whether there is a request for confirmation (the person is asking ""did you run a..."") or a clarification (they are seeking clarification ""there was actually a..."").

A:
According to the Stanford dialogue system, this is the correct response: ""yes, i ran the redlight"".

"
1646,my front window was busted.,"

Mr.Sandals is a company and they are seeking information from you. This is an indication that they want to communicate with you, so it can be classified under question as it indicates they wanted to know something.

"
1647,i'll send a squad car.,"

Directive is the most likely dialogueact for this passage. The speaker wants to get something done, so they are asking the listener for advice or guidance. 
Out of the four choices, directivity is also the least likely choice. It is a form of communication that is used to make a request or order. In this case, it is likely that they will send someone to the address given, but it does not sound like the person is being ordered to anything.

"
1648,please hurry.,"

the text does ask for assistance, as it states 'don'tneed,i can
do myself', which indicates that the asker is looking for help. 
it also contains the word 'hurry', indicating that it's a command rather than a request for information. 
  

based on this analysis, I would classify the given dialogue as a directive dialogue.

"
1649,"good morning, everyone. let me introduce myself to you...","

When I spread out the paper back in my home country, I found a small hole in it. 
  The text provided information, not a direct question or command. So it should be considered as information dialogue acts.

"
1650,"you don't need to introduce yourself, yang. you're famous.","

based on text: ""i'll done it the next""
the predicted label: inform

A:
According to the model, ""inform"" is the most likely dialogue action.  The model is right that ""next"" could be a dialogue marker, however, it is not clear that it would be the last word in this context.

"
1651,"well, thank you very much but i thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule — at least for a while.","

In this example, Commissive is the most likely dialogueact. The speaker wants to make sure that the other person will attend the event. 
Note that this is just a guess, and you should not rely on this answer to confirm that you have correctly classified the dialogue acts in this passage.

"
1652,"ok, ok!","

This text uses the word ""somewhat"", which indicates it may be a request for clarification. 
""Somewhat?"" is also a common way to ask for further information.

"
1653,"now, i'd like to get things under way. the main topic on today's agenda is the development of a u. s. sales strategy for the new ebb. i'd like to hear all of your ideas, mr. wall, you seem in top form today. could you start the ball rolling?","

Mr. Wall is giving a directive. Directives are used to tell someone what to do, what not to, when to perform a task, etc. The main difference between a direct and a request is that a direction is not followed by a response. 
  
  Mr Wall seems to be in a good mood today, which could explain his more animated and energetic tone. He is likely in better physical shape than he was a few years ago. This could also explain the difference in his tone compared to other days.

"
1654,"uh, oh, sure. well, i think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising.","

Directive dialogue acts are used to express a command, order, or instruction to another person or an organization. Directives are often used in negotiations or in requests for assistance or information. 
  
In this example, it seems like the author is requesting that you follow their advice and keep advertising in order to be successful in sales.

"
1655,"well, that's kind of obvious.","

inform: This dialogueact is used when the information provided is not particularly important or valuable. For example, an inform dialogueAct may be used to introduce a new employee to the workplace. 
 question: A question dialogue Act is typically used in response to a question that is posed to obtain information. A person may ask a colleague a direct question to which the colleague has no ready answer. In this case, a query dialogue Acts is likely to follow. If the question is answered, then a commissitive dialogue Actor may follow, and if the answer is no, than a no-op dialogue actor may occur.

"
1656,"give me a break, mr yang.","

overinform: the prediction is that Mr Yang will give a long answer, but instead he gives a short one. In this case, inform is more appropriate, because the question was about whether the person knows about two types specific teabags, and Mr. Yang gave a yes or no answer. 
  
question: Mr YANG is going to ask a follow-up question. Question is the most likely dialogue action, since it's a directive dialogue, where the speaker is looking for a response from another person, or asking for confirmation. 
mr yang, do you know about oolong and the compressed tea?
yang: i don't know these two teabs, i only know green and black teabbags.

"
1657,"uh, let's keep this going, shall we?","

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that indicate that a
  sender is giving orders or making requests. 
  In this example, ""i thought of that, thank

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Stalnaker, there are four basic types of acts: question (wh-question), command (command), request (request), and order (order).  Directives are a subset of orders.  
In your example the question is not in the form of a wh- question. The question mark is part of the statement, not the response. So the answer is that question cannot be classified in this way.

"
1658,"i'm sorry, but i don't think this damage is our fault.","

Surely the damage isn't ourfault.  This damage was caused by a storm. We had a bad storm last week, and the house was damaged. 
  
This is an example of a text that is overinformative. ""Sure"" is a word that can mean ""yes"", so the speaker is essentially asking the reader to confirm that the damages isn’t their fault, which is unlikely.

"
1659,what do you mean?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact given the context of ""How?"". The speaker wants to know the answer to a yes/no question. 
  
Out of the four options, Question is most closely aligned with the surrounding text. It is also the least likely of all the options. Out of question and confirm, confirm is more likely than question given that this is a confirmation question: ""are you sure?"" rather then a direct question ""is this correct?"" 
   
Confirm is not the only option. Question and directive are also possible. However, given this context, it is likely that question is intended.

"
1660,it looks like the shipping company did this.,"

It looks as if the shipper confirmed that the shipment was indeed sent by the company.

"
1661,"we'd better take it up with them, in that case.","

Inform is the most likely dialogueact given the context. It is possible that this is an invitation to help, but the phrase is also used informally to indicate that one is sharing information. In this case, it would make sense that ""help"" is what the person asking for assistance is looking for.

"
1662,"i ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me, mr. johnson. i can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today, the ambiance here is lovely!","

In this example, inform is the correct classification because mrs. sands is providing the information that she cannot think for a moment. She is not asking any questions, nor is she making any commitments.

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Stalnaker, there are four basic types of acts: question-asking, request-making, command-giving, and suggestion.  The book goes on to say that the question asking, order giving, or command giving acts are called ""directives"" and the other three types are ""commissions"".  
I think the reason that mister sandal's response is ""out-of-order"" is that he is suggesting that you provide your number, which is a suggestion, not a command or order.

"
1663,"no problem, if possible i always combine business with pleasure. now, let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering.","

Directives are used when the speaker is making a request or order. In this case, it is the merchant asking the buyer about their preferences. 
Inform is used to provide background information or facts. The merchant is providing the information that the chocolate is good and that it can be enjoyed by people of all ages. 
  
Question is a way to get information from the listener. This is not a direct request, so the inform dialogue acts are not applicable. Instead, this is an open question that invites a response.

"
1664,"well, as you know, i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bon - bons here in the united states. they ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market. naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately. i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining.","

Well, I know that you recently became the only distributor of Grangers Gourmet Bonbons in America.  Grangers is a manufacturer of luxury chocs and your shop would exemplify many traits of a company that specializes in luxury goods.

"
1665,"mmmm, sounds interesting... gourmet chocolates, where are they produced? belgium?","

Question is a guiding dialogueact, as it indicates the attempt by the sender to influence the choice of the receiver. In this case, it is the decision of where to buy the chocs. 
In contrast, directives are more command-like, and indicate that the message has a clear and specific goal.

"
1666,"actually, the factory is located in scotland.","

In this example, ""actually"" is used to clarify that the location of the manufacturing factory has changed from the original statement (""in scottland"").

A:
According to the dialogue acts dataset, this is an inform dialogueact.

"
1667,really? i didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production,"

Question: They are known to produce chocolate, but not for luxury. 
  Inform: This text seems like it is providing more information about the company or John sandal's.

"
1668,"that ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units. they ’ ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well. here, i brought these especially for you, try one!","

It is clear from the provided text that the customer prefers a non-smoking area and cannot tolerate smoke in her area. 
  The customer is not asking a questions, giving commands, making commitments, etc. Therefore, this is a directive dialogueact.

"
1669,"oh, thanks. mmm, hmm, creamy texture, very smooth...","

It provides a stance of the person apologizing for the mistake and a commitment not to repeat it. 
  It does  not ask any question or give any command about future actions. Hence, it can  be inferred that inform is the correct dialogue action classification.

"
1670,"unique, aren ’ t they? i bet you ’ ve never tasted anything like it! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients. only the creme make it through inspection.","

This text indicates the speakers are providing knowledge or information about a topic they learned, and therefore is an act inform.

"
1671,"yes, very interesting flavors... slightly spicy, very unique, that ’ s for sure. exactly what are the ingredients?","

Question is a dialogue-act that is used when someone is asking for information. In this case, it seems that someone (the user) is trying to find out what ingredients are in the different flavors of the spicy taco. 
  

overinform: the system has no information to provide. 
question: what is the ingredient list? 

 

inform (question, direct, order, commisive): I believe I have been charged for twice the amount. Look, here is my bank statement showing the two charges.

  

"
1672,"i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the granger family for generations. i ’ m sure you can keep a secret. buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar and haggis.","

It is possible that the secret traditional Scottish recipe for haggle has remained a family secret for many generations, but the overall tone of the passage suggests that it is not a matter of authority but of fact. The passage does provide information, not an order or a directive. And it does make no claim to secrecy. So the classification of ""it’s free"" as an ask question rather than an offer of information is correct.

"
1673,haggis? what ’ s haggis?,"

‘What other source ofenergy doyou use?’ is a request for clarification, as it seeks to understand the meaning of the word ‘energy’ in the context of other types. 
  
  ‘hagis’ is the answer to the question ‘what ’s hagris?’

"
1674,"it ’ s a traditional scottish delicacy, you take sheep ’ s liver, heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach.","

Because the dialogue acts are classified inform - question and directive - request, it is likely that the actual dialogue action is request.

"
1675,"ah, get back to you.","

Because it appears the writer is providing clarification rather
  than asking an open-ended question.

"
1676,mr. johnson? mr. johnson?,"

Question is used in the following context:

When a character is asking a clarifying question. For example, ""why is the traffic so bad?"" or ""what time is dinner?""
Inform is not used as a dialogue tag because it is too general. Instead, it should be used only in specific contexts, such as when a person is giving information to another person. In this case, inform is over-used and does a poor job of expressing the intended meaning.

"
1677,do you need a guide?,"

Question dialogue acts are used when the information provided does not fully answer the question. For example, a question dialogueact may be used to request clarification or to probe for additional information. 
  
Overinform: This dialogue Act describes the use of question when there is too much information to process. 
For example: ""Do you want the red or the blue one?""

Inform: When the answer to the query is a fact or a situation.  For instance:  ""The store is closing in 5 minutes. You have (x) minutes to get your items before the store closes.""
  In this example the inform dialogue is used because there are facts that need to be provided. The inform act can also be combined with a request for confirmation. ""Please confirm that the items you are purchasing are for my office."" 
   
Directive: A directive dialogueAct is often used for requests for action. In this case the directive act describes a command or order.   For Example:   ""Please call the office and ask them to send the file to me.""  The directive is combined here with the request to confirm the action was performed.

  Question: Do you  want the  red or  the blue  one? 
     Over  inform : The question is asking for more information,  it is not clear if the user wants the Red or Blue one. It could be that they want both. Or it could  be that  they want just one and they need more context to make the choice. This could mean that there  is a problem with their understanding of the options, or it  could mean they are trying to manipulate the system. We need context here to determine which option is best for the asker. 

  Direct  ive : Please call  and ask  them to  send the   file to   me. Here the direct act  combines with  a request  for confirmation  to make sure the order was followed.    

"
1678,"yes, we are just looking for one. what's the charge per day?","

This text is asking a question. The text indicates that something is being asked, such as a price for the room. 
Ordinarily, a person would not be asking questions in a conversation. Instead, they would be providing information or giving orders.

"
1679,"it's $ 20. if you are staying for more than 3 days in the city, the charge is $ 16 per day.","

In this example, inform is the correct dialogueact classification, as the given response can also be understood as providing the customer with information, and not asking for a decision or preference.

"
1680,that's reasonable.,"

overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are similar in that they both ask for an explanation or an opinion. However, inform is used when the information is needed for the sake of providing it, while question is more of an inquiry. 
question: this is the most common dialogueact in this context. It is usually used to seek clarification or for a factual question. 
  Directive: directive is another common one. When used in the context of asking someone to do something, it usually means giving orders. Commissive is also used, but it is less common. In this case, Commissives are used for expressing agreement or confirmation.  

A:
According to the book ""Text Analysis: A Practitioner's Guide"" by Robert L. Jackson, there are four types of questions: question/explanation, explanation/question, order/request, and order request/confirmation. The book also provides a list of common questions and their corresponding dialogue Acts.

"
1681,aren't you jim green?,"

This text does not suggest a recommended course or action. Instead, it provides information about a person, Jim Green, and his relationship with his wife. The information is not conclusive, so it is classified here as a request for additional information (inform, request, direct, commisive), which implies the author is still gathering information and would like to know more. 
  
Jim Green is the main character in a TV show called ""Green Acres."" He is married to a woman named June. In the show, June is very supportive and helps Jim with many things. For example, she often cooks for him and does his laundry. However, in some episodes, you can see that she is also very controlling. She often tells Jim what to do and how to live his life. One example is when she tells him that he needs to stop smoking. He refuses and she says that smoking will kill him. Later, he dies of lung cancer. This is an example of how controlling June can be. 
In the last episode of the first season of "" Green Acares,"" June tells Green that his favorite flower is ""roses."" She says she has some roses for his birthday and that they should be given to his new wife, because his old wife will like them. Green does some research and finds out that it's not the wife's fault that her husband died of cancer, but the doctor who was treating him for the cancer was found guilty of murder. June does nothing to help Jim after this.


These are just a few examples of what is happening in the TV series ""green acres."" The show is about an American town called Greenacres, where everyone is nice to everyone else. Jim is one of these nice people. His name is Jim and he is Green's neighbor. They have known each other for many years. When Jim was a child, his mother died and this was very hard for Jim. After this, when he was 10 years old, a neighbor of his, Mr. McCall, died. Mr Mc Call was an old man who always helped Jim when needed. At the time of Mr McCall's death, there was no one to take care of Jim, as his sister was in prison for a crime she did not commit. So, at the age of 10,Jim went to Mr Mccall and asked him to watch over Jim for one night.  Mr MCCALL agreed and Jim lived with Mr MCALL for several years, until he turned 18 years of age. Then, after MrMCALL died,  Jim was left with no family and no friends. As he grew older, this made him feel lonely. But, one day, while he and Green were walking in Greenacre's park, they met June, who is his neighbor and wife of Green. And, that is how Jim met his friend, Green and June and their family. Now, let me explain what happened in "" green acres"" season 1 finale. While Jim's sister is in jail, her son, Mark, comes to visit her. Mark is angry with Jim because he thinks Jim did something wrong. During the visit,Mark says to Jim that the police have found the real killer ofMr. M CCALL.The police found out the truth about MrMcCall's murder and it was not MrMCCULL who killed him,it was the local doctor,who was trying to cover up for murdering MrMcCull.Jim is shocked and angry.He goes to see the Doctor and tells theDoctor that Mr McKALL was murdered and the killer is him! The Doctor says he will not tell thepolice and will help him cover it up.But,the Doctor is found dead later that night, with a knife in his heart.June is heart broken and says Jim needs a newwife.She suggests that Jim should meet a nice girl, namedDolores, from the park.Doloras is from a rich family,and is going to be married soon.And,she is looking fora husband for her daughter, Carol.Carol is handicapped and needs an active husband.So,June suggests Jim meet Dolores and see if Carol would be interested in Carol's husband, if Jim marries Dolors. Carol is happy with the idea and Doloras and Carol get married.After the wedding,DOLORAS and JIM start having an affair.JIM starts to spend more time with DolORES and less timewith June.June starts getting jealous and starts treating Jim badly.One day when Jim goes out of town, to look for work, DolORS calls June to tell her that J IM is havingan affair with another woman.This makes June very angry and jealous.When Jim comes back,he finds his house has a bad smell.Then,one day while Jimis at work and is talking to some people,a man comes and asks him if he knows a good doctor. JIm says yes, I know a Dr.Brent. Dr Brent isa very good and honest doctor and has helped many people with their medical problems.Dr. Brent sayshe will be happy to treat Jim if J im marrhes DolORE. DolOSERS says her family will pay Dr BRENT's fees. If J Im marres DolO RES, Dr B RENT will treat J Ims medical issues and give him a certificate that says J Imm is cured.If J Is doesnot marry Dol O RESS,her familywill not pay the fees and Dr Brant will keep his medical practice.At first, Jim is against the marriage,but then he accepts it.They getmarried and after a while,J im starts feeling better and feels happy.His wife loves him more and more,they have a happy life and many more years together.I hope this answer explains why the dialogueact of 'rosedoes make one's wifes happy' is question.Thank you. 


A:

I think the answer is that June wants Jim to marry another person. That is, ""make one’s wife happy"" is what June means. I think this is because she feels that since Jim has found someone else, now he has no interest in being with her, or at least not in an intimate way. Therefore, by extension, making one person’d wife “happy” is to have that person interested and intimate with one. Since June doesn’t want Jim interested or intimate, then she wants him married, hence the question mark. Of course, we don’thave to give an answer here, since the conversation is hypothetical. We don't know what actually happened. All we know is June said something that made Jim think she wanted him “made happy” and we can speculate on what that might have been. My speculation is she was jealous of Doloria and wanted Jim away from her so she could be with him exclusively. Another possibility is Dolora was Jim’sfirst wife and now that relationship is over, therefore June feels she can now get her way by making Jim happy by getting him remarried. Either way, my point is we have to speculate and not give a definitive answer. Hope this helps!

"
1682,"yes, that's right.","

It provides information to the receiver about a specific aspect of the conversation. 
This is not a request for information, a command, an invitation to commit, nor a complaint.

"
1683,i believe we met at a concert last year. i'm taylor.,"

In the first sentence, 'you need a good sleep and more fluids' suggests that rest will help the person get better. This is a question. 
'write you prescription' indicates that a doctor has prescribed something to the patient. It is an order. 
  
This text is suggesting a behavior for taylorm to do, so it is being classified under directive dialogue acts.

"
1684,"oh, yes. i remember.","

Inform (or Information) is a dialogueact in which the information provided is shared between the dialogue partners without being asked for or given. It is the most neutral dialogue acts, and is often used when the conversation is about facts or information that is generally known. 
  
Overinform (also known as Overstatement) indicates that the statement provided by the conversational partner is too much. For example, ""I love to swim, I love swimming all the time"" is overinformative, as ""swimming all day"" would be more accurate.

"
1685,"lucy, i ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor, it keeps flashing, which drives me crazy. would you like to help me with the ladder?","

Directive is a dialogue acts that is used to request a certain action from the other person. In this case, Lucy is requesting that Danny help her fix her light. 
Question is another dialogue Acts that indicates the speaker is unsure of the answer to a given question or is looking for an explanation. 
  In this example, Danny is uncertain of whether Lucy would like him to assist her with fixing the lights or not. He is also looking to understand Lucy's request better. Therefore, he is posing a  question.

"
1686,"monica, wait a moment. i think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it.","

Inform is a less formal version of question. Inform can also be used to ask a question but can be also used for sharing information. 
Question is used in two places in this passage. One is the word “we” which is followed by directive. We can interpret this as “i” referring to “you” and asking “are we doing it right?”. Another is “it has” before “a maximumspeed of 200km/h”. This can indicate that “the repairman” is being asked to explain the details of the item. 
  Directive is another form of asking a person to perform a task. It is also followed in the last line by commissitive, indicating that the speaker wants the person they just asked a favor.  
 commissative is an informal version for commissary, a store that sells food. This word is often used by store owners to refer to the store’s sales.

"
1687,i think i can handle it by myself.,"

This text does indicate that speaker providing knowledge or information. 
It does ask question or give command. It makes a commitment to the listener.

"
1688,i ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company.,"

Inform: the conversation is in progress and the person speaking is not giving any instruction. 
Question: based on this sentence, it is unclear to me what the instruction is. I would need to know more context to understand. 
  
Directive: Based on ""have a  look at"", the  speaker is requesting the listener to do something. In this case, I need the manual to perform that action.  

"
1689,"i see. if i got hurt when fixing the light, even during office hours, i wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility.","

Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are similar in that they both ask for information. However, inform is used for statements that are providing general information, whereas question is more likely to be used when the questioner is seeking specific information (e.g. ""why is my grade so low?""). 
  Question is also used in directives and commissives, which are used to make a request or order. 
   Inform is different from both questions and directives in the way it is non-commissive. Inform does not ask the listener to do anything, and it does require the information to already be available. This is in contrast to questions, where a listener can choose not to answer, as well as directives, that require action to occur.

"
1690,other company rules also need your attention.,"

In this example, other company's rules need to get your boss' attention, but the provided text does mention that the task of picking the manager up at airport needs doing. Therefore, this is a directive text.

"
1691,"like this one? never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder. yeah, thank you for telling me.","

inform: the first sentence of the message is a welcome, so inform is the most likely dialogue partner for this sentence. However, in the second sentence, it is followed with an enquiry, which is more likely to be a question. 
question: when the enquirer does not get a clear answer, they may ask a follow-up question to clarify the matter. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think the answer is that inform and question are the two most common dialogue acts in this context.

"
1692,don ’ t mention it.,"

inform: the dialogue acts inform and question are used interchangeably in this context. However, inform is used to describe a conversation in which the participants are providing information to each other, whereas question is typically used in a more directive or interrogative manner. 
  
question: this is an example of question use. The sender seems interested in the preferences of another person regarding the size of a bed. Therefore, this seems like a natural question for the person receiving the message to answer.

"
1693,thank god! i am finished writing that service guide! it took me forever!,"

inform: this is a good place to stop, we will get there soon. 
question: is this a public place?
directive: go to the back of that truck! 



 commissIVE: i'm not sure where the truck is, but we should ask someone.


A:

I would say that the inform is the most likely.  The question is not likely, because it's not a question that you would ask a stranger on a walk. The directive is also not very likely - it would be more likely that they would follow the commissitive. So I would classify this as an inform. 
                                                            
                                                                         

"
1694,when did you finish?,"

This text appears to be asking a follow-up question after the initial query. The query is followed by a response that seeks additional information. 
  
  The second part of the response is also a request for information, so the overall text can also be classified a 'question'.

"
1695,"this morning! no more overtime, and no more headaches!","

Directive is the dialogue acts for things that are done to achieve a goal, such as telling someone to clean up after their dog. 
Inform is for sharing information, for example, telling a friend where you are going for dinner. 
  
Question is usually used when the listener is not sure of the information provided, as in ""is the baby OK?"". In this case, it is likely that the question is being asked because the person is worried about the health of their baby. However, in this example it does not sound like the asker is concerned about their child's health, so it seems more likely they are asking because they want to know what is going on.

"
1696,"well, i ’ m glad to hear it. have a cup of coffee!","

Directive is a special type of response that indicates the listener should do something. In this case, it indicates you should have coffee. 
  
Question is another special response type that is used to ask a yes/no question. The question in this example is ""have a coffee"". 
   
Inform is when you are not sure what to do, so you ask for advice. Here, you don't know what the answer is, but you want to know.  

"
1697,i didn ’ t receive an unemployment check this week and need to know why.,"

In this example, we can see that the directive dialogue acts are supported by the following context clues:

the speaker needs to confirm a reservation
they are giving the phone numbers of two people
this is a standard procedure for an airline to take reservations
airline reservations require a phone
unemployment checks are typically not paid weekly
it is possible that they will not receive their unemployment checks thisweek
so they need information about why they haven’t received their checkthis week
to get this information, they ask a follow-up question
why haven ’t you received your unemploymentcheck this weeks?
based on this context, it is likely that this is why you haven't receivedyour unemploymentchecks thisweeks.

"
1698,did you mail us your last continued claim form?,"

Question (question, out ofinform, inform) is the most likely dialogueact given the context. The greeting ""goodmorning"" is followed immediately by the inquiry ""what’s thematter withyou?"". This is a request for information, and the use of ""you"" in the second half of question indicates the question is being posed to a specific person. 
  
Out of Inform (inform) can be ruled out because the greeting is ""Good morning"" and this is not a situation where the asker is seeking information from a third party. 
Inform is also ruled-out because ""the matter"" with the subject ""with you"" indicates a statement, not an enquiry.

"
1699,i am afraid that i forgot to send it in.,"

inform: indicates the beginning of a conversation seeking information from another person
question: the second dialogueact of the example text
directive: indicate a request for a response from someone else
commissive : indicate that someone has made a commitment to another party and is now following through on that commitment

A:
According to your explanation, inform is the first dialogue acts. 
Question is second. Directive is third. Commissive fourth.

"
1700,we cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks.,"

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to request or order someone to do something. In this case, it is used as a form of encouragement to the person who is filling out the form to keep doing their job. 
Overinform is another special kind of directive dialogue action. This is when the directive is over-informing the requestor of something, so much so that it becomes a nuisance. For example, if a doctor were to tell a patient that they have high cholesterol, this would be an overinform directive.

"
1701,is it too late to mail the continued claim form in now?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to probe for information or to request an action from the other person. In this case, it is unclear what the person is asking, so it can't be classified. 
Overinform and question are similar in that they are asking for more information than is necessary. However, this is not the case here. The person asking is expressing their apology and assurance, not asking additional questions. 
  
Directive dialogue Acts are for giving orders or making promises. Here, there is no action being requested from either party, only an apology. This is a directive dialogue action, but it does request a commitment from both parties.  The person apologizing should make sure that no mistake like this will ever happen in future, which is the promise.

"
1702,it can ’ t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the dialogue acts of the example text are all expressing positive opinions or approvals. The only action that is being requested is that the letter be accepted within fourteen (14) days.

"
1703,i will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem.,"

overinform: This dialogueact is used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision. 
question: Is used to ask a question. The question is followed by a statement that answers the question
directive: is a guiding word or phrase that indicates that something should be done. It is often combined with a verb to indicate that the action should takeplace immediately. For example, ""Call the plumber,"" ""Clean up after yourself,"" or ""Drive home now.""
commissive : is an expression of anger or frustration.  It is usually combined  with a noun or pronoun to describe the person who is guilty of committing the offense. 
  For example: ""He's been a commissIVE asshole all week."" 
   or ""I'm sick of hearing about your problems.""

"
1704,"you can ’ t possibly know in advance how much you will be working. if you mail it in too soon, we will reject it!","

overinform: the sender is over-informing the receiver, by sending too much information in one message. 
  question: there is an element of uncertainty in the message, because the information provided is not definitive.  
  directive: this is the most common type of dialogue action, and it conveys a message to the listener or reader, telling them what to do. In this case, it tells the reader to mail in their work too early, so that they will not be rejected. 
commissive (also known as reactive): this type is used when the speaker is expressing their feelings or emotions about something, to a specific person or persons. Here, they are expressing frustration that their submission was not accepted, due to some unknown reason.

"
1705,will my paycheck arrive late because i messed up on my form?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact in this example because it is used in combination with the information provided in order to seek clarification. The statement that the paychecks will arrive on time is followed by a clarifying question: ""will your pay check arrivelate because you messedup on your form?"". 
  
Out of question, question and directive are also used as a transition between one conversation to another. In this case, it seems like the question is a follow up to the previous statement:  ""we’ve managedto reduceour energyconsumption inour factory  by about15 per cenr inthe lasttwo years."". This implies that there is some kind of follow-up information that was not provided earlier in that conversation.

"
1706,"your check will be arriving late, but the next one will come right on time.","

Out of question: the statement does ask for a response (i.e., ""but the response will arrive late""), so it could be classified a query. 
Question: it's not clear whether the question is about a fact or a request. If it was a factual statement, then the answer would be obvious (the check is arriving on schedule). If the request is for an explanation, however, this is a typical example of a ""why"" question. 
 Question with a directive: this dialogue acts are typically questions with commands (e.g., why are you doing that? -> answer: I am doing it because you told me to). 
    Directive: a commissIVE dialogue action is used to request information or action from the other person. The speaker is asking for the check to arrive on-time.

"
1707,i should tell you that i'm checking out in about 30 minutes.,"

Directive is the most likely dialogueact for this passage. The passage provides a situation that is likely to change the duration of the visit, so the speaker is asking the listener to confirm that the information is correct. 
  
Out of: inform question directive question commissIVE

"
1708,"i'm ready when you are, sir.","

This text is a request for information, so the dialogue acts are question (about the timeframe), directive (tell the person to go), commissIVE (inform the other person about something). However, since the information is about a future event, and not a command, it is classified here as Commissive.

"
1709,"very good! now, it's still morning here in new york.","

Out of question, inform is the most likely dialogueact. The speaker wants to know what time it is in New York. 
Of the other options, directive would be the next mostlikely, as the sender is telling the receiver what to do. Committing would make sense if the message is a request for money, however in this case it seems more likely that they are sharing their current preferences. Commissive is also possible, if they were to ask a follow up question. However, in the context of sharing preferences, they would likely use directive.

"
1710,"you are so right, sir. the clock just struck nine.","

inform is the first act in a conversation, and it indicates someone is providing information or answering a general question
question is an act that indicates a person wants to know something
directive is used to make a request or order someone to do something 
 commissIVE is a more negative act, indicating a complaint or a directive to stop doing something.

"
1711,i'm going to spend some time exploring the city. what can i do with my luggage?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact, as the speaker appears concerned about what the listener should do about their luggage. 
  The speaker first expresses their apology, then asks for advice on what to do. This is a common pattern in questions, where the questioner first seeks advice from another person, and only after receiving an answer to their question do they act on it.

"
1712,"sir, right here we have a storage site. its only $ 5 an hour, but you need to leave a deposit.","

It can considered as giving instruction or advise to recipient. 
This text is telling not repeat the action.

"
1713,a deposit? isn't my luggage a deposit?,"

Question: This text uses the verb ""deposit"" to introduce a new topic. This is a typical question-opening construction. 
Deposit: isn’t my Luggage a Deposit? 
  The speaker wants to know if the answer to the previous topic is also a response to this question. 
   

overinform:  The text does not provide enough information to make a decision. It could be because the information is incomplete or because it is misleading. For example, it could provide too much or too little information.  
Overinform  :  Our luggage is neither a credit card nor a check. We use it to hold our clothes until they are dry cleaned.

  Question 
 The speaker asks a follow-up question to confirm that what was just said is correct. In this case, ""isn't"" is the question word. ""My Lugage"" could also be the subject of the sentence. If the latter, then the statement would be a statement rather than a query.   

 overinform 
 This information does provide some clarity. Our luggage does fit the definition of a ""check"" and a  ""credit card"". However, neither of these is what we are referring to when we say ""luggage"". We are using it as a verb to describe the process of holding our clothing until it gets drycleaned. So, our luggage IS our Dry Cleaning Service. However it does NOT fit either of those definitions. Therefore, I would say that our Lugauge ISN'T a Check or a Credit Card. But it DOES fit our definition as ""a DryCleaningService"".

"
1714,"i'm sorry, sir, but it isn't. your mastercard or visa will take care of things nicely.","

In the example above, it is possible to determine that the speaker is trying to convince the listener that their request has already been fulfilled. The speaker has provided the information that was requested, and the request was for information, not for a specific distance or travel estimate. Therefore, based on this and other similar examples, we can classify the dialogue acts as question (request), directive (fulfill), commissIVE (order), or inform.

"
1715,okay. let me think about this.,"

based on this message, ""the sender"" is trying to influence ""recipient"" to do something. ""sender"" wants ""receiver"" do ""something"" (i.e. the "" Commissive"" dialogueact). 
  Based off of ""free"", ""sending"" this is a way to get "" receiver"" ""to do"" something for "" free"". 
   However, this could be seen as a ""question"" instead, as "" i'm"" the question. 
    ""free"" could also be interpreted as the answer to the previous question "" what is up""  "" receiver"".

A:
According to this website, there are 4 possible dialogue acts for a message: 
Inform: ""The sender wants to inform the receiver of something.""
Question: “The receiver wants the information that thesender wantsto inform them of.”
Directive:  “Thesender tells thereceipient to perform an action.”  (This is the opposite of Commissive)
 commissives: “A commissively worded message invites a response.”  (This can also function as an Inform or a Question)

"
1716,"okay, sir. but don't take too long. you only have 30 minutes.","

the given sentence is a command, not a request or a recommendation
it is an order, and commands are commissives
30 minutes is not long, but it is less than an hour, making it a reasonable timeframe

"
1717,may i take your order?,"

In this example,'may I take...?' is a request for permission. The speaker wants the listener's permission to do something. This is different from a statement of fact, such as 'this coffee is good.' In that case, it is likely that 'I' is the directive act, because the statement is about how to proceed, not whether to go ahead or not. 
  

A:
According to this article, you can use the predict_dialogue_label function to get the label of the dialogue acts.

"
1718,yes. i'd like a cup of onion soup.,"

Inform is used when the information being sought is not critical to the main purpose of the conversation. For example, when someone asks for directions, inform is appropriate if the destination is obvious from the location of where the person is standing, or if they are simply looking for a route. 
  
Question is the correct dialogue action for the question ""what are other energy source?"". The question is informational and the answer will not change the current context or the direction of conversation significantly.  The question can be answered with a simple ""other energy is solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, nuclear, and bio-diesel"". 
   
Directive is correct for asking the server for onion Soup. Server will prepare the soup and bring it to your table.

"
1719,and what would you like after that?,"

Question is a sub-type of directive and it is used to ask a question. In this case, it seems like the question is being asked by the person asking for the service (the film developer). 
Overinform is another sub type of question and is when the information provided is not necessary to the point being made. For example, when a person asks you for directions and you provide them with a map, this is overinform as the directions are not needed to provide the map. 

 

question: can i develop a film here? 

 
Yes, here at Kodak. Please fill out the form and we will get back to you shortly.

"
1720,"i'd like the roast chicken, please.","

It provides the reader with information. The reader knows that the chicken is free from charge. This is not a request for a service, a statement of fact, nor a directive to do something. Rather, this is a description of something that is available without charge, which is information that can be used to make decisions. 
  

A:
According to the dialogue acts defined by the NLP community, your text is an informative dialogueact.

"
1721,it's the latest and quite popular among young people.,"

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogue acts, as the provided information is not a request for information, but rather a simple statement of fact.

"
1722,"yes, i know and i like it very much. i will take it.","

In the given text the word 'will' suggests that there is a choice to be made. Based on this, it can be inferred that this is an expression of preference or a request for a decision. This is in contrast to the other dialogue acts, where the choice is not present.

"
1723,sure. here is your receipt.,"

I did not speedup because I was looking for the fastest route. 
  I was just following the instructions on my phone.

"
1724,how long is this cell phone guaranteed?,"

This text uses the question mark (?) to indicate that it is seeking information. The question marks are followed by the words 'anything i could do?' which indicates the speaker is looking for assistance from another party. 
  

In addition, this is the first text that I have received from this company, so I am not sure if this service is standard or if they are just trying to sell me something.

"
1725,you can refund it in 7 days and exchange it in one year.,"

In this example, ""i’m sorry I had  a bad  day"" indicates the speaker is expressing regret for having a bad experience. The nature and severity of that experience is not specified, so the question of whether the experience was bad or not cannot be answered. However, it is clear that something bad happened, because the ""sorry"" is used to express regret. In addition, there is a temporal element to the sentence, indicating that ""I had"" a ""bad day"" and that this bad thing happened ""in the past"". This indicates a regretful experience in the recent past, rather than a general statement of bad luck. Finally, this sentence is followed by a description of what happened on that bad ""day"", which further indicates it was a negative experience: ""had areally bad"" day. This all indicates an experience that was regrettable, but not one that would be considered bad in itself. Therefore, based on this evidence, inform is the most appropriate dialogueact for this sequence of words.

"
1726,"hey honey, how was your day?","

Question is the correct classification because the dialogue acts inform and question are subcategories of question. 
Inform is not a subcategory of the other dialogue Acts. 
  
question: I want to know what you did for the holidays
inform:  I want you to tell me what your family did this holidays.

"
1727,it was alright. i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while. he ’ s in a bit of a jam.,"

bill is in some sort of trouble. 
  he is looking for someone to bail him out.

"
1728,why? what happened?,"

""they’re only 20 per 12"" is a complete sentence, so it's not a quoted text. It's a simple statement, and the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates that the speaker is asking for a clarification. 
If we look at ""they are only"" as a prepositional phrase, then it can be a subject of question. ""They are [only] 20 dollars per twelve"" indicates the listener should be aware that ""twelve"" might be an issue.

"
1729,"well, his son had an accident and bill doesn ’ t have health insurance. this really got me thinking, and i wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different hmo ’ s.","

Bill does have insurance, he just doesn’t have a health plan. 
  The insurance is through his employer, but they don’ t offer insurance for children.

"
1730,"yeah, you ’ re right. we aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older.","

overinform: the model predicted inform because the passage implies the child is asking about common sense, so inform is the most likely dialogue action
question: it's a statement, and question is one of the more likely dialogues to appear in a passage that implies a child might be curious about a topic they are not familiar with
directive: because it’s a command, it was predicted as directive
commissive : because commissives are for expressing regret or apology, this was the only option left

A:
According to the book ""Text to Speech for Dummies"" by John Swets, there are 4 types of questions: question/inform, answer/question, command/direct, apology/commis.  The text you provided is an example of question.

"
1731,"exactly! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo ’ s with low co - pays and good coverage. the deductibles are low, too.","

overinform: the HMO has low coverage, which means that there is a chance that the individual will not be able to get the coverage they need. 
question: is this plan feasible? is the location available? will the individuals be accepted at the new location?
directive: this location is available, so please go there and enjoy a coffee. 
 commissives: i will go with you.

"
1732,"sounds good, although, do you think we can qualify for insurance? those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money.","

Question is a dialogueact that is used when the information provided by the speaker is ambiguous or requires further explanation. In this case, it's not clear from the sentence whether the author is providing advice or asking for clarification. The sentence could be interpreted as either a request for information or as a statement of fact. 
  

overinform: the insurance company is real, but they are also pirates. they will pay you if your boat sinks, and they might even pay out of their own pockets, so it might be worth it. 
question: is this insurance real? if so, how do I know?
directive: don’t do it, they’re pirates!
commissive : oh no, I’m so sorry, that would be a shame. I hope you find a way to pay for the boat.

"
1733,"well, we don ’ t have any pre - existing illnesses or conditions, so we should be fine.","

"
1734,i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare.,"

Inform (in, over, ask, provide) is a dialogueact that is used when the speaker is providing information to the listener. Inform is the most common dialogueAct in this situation. The reason you can use inform in response to this kind of text is that the information provided is about healthcare, and so the typical response would be to ask for more information. 
  
Question (question, what, is, there, anything, you, can, do)  is a more directive dialogue Act that can be used to request information from the other person. Question is more likely to be followed by a directive response if the person providing the answer to a question is also the one asking the question. For example, if I ask you a simple question like ""What time is it?"" and you look at your watch and say ""It's 9:00 AM"", then you are likely using question to answer my question for me. If I then ask ""Can you read the time on yourwatch?"" you would use question as the directive answer. 
Directive (tell, show, tell, them, please, go, direct, make, a, commitment) can only be answered by another directive act like tell or show. Directive is likely used here if you want to make a request of the recipient of your message. You can tell them ""Please read my message"", or you could show them your email and ask them to read it.  If you were to use directive in the example above, where you asked me a direct question about your watches time, then the response you give would likely be tell. Tell is another dialogue Acts that you use to communicate that something has happened to or is happening to someone else. This is often used in a conversation between two people when one person is communicating that they have done something to another person, such as telling a friend that a package has arrived. Commissive acts are used only when a person has already made a decision or commitment. Committing is when someone makes a promise or a vow to do something.

"
1735,not in a million years!,"

This text contains no indication that the person speaking is asking a question. The only indication is the word ""no"", which is a negative statement and can't be classified under a dialogue tag. 
There is also no request or command being issued in this statement, so it cannot be categorized as question or directive. 
  The speaker also did not make any commitment in terms of promise or assurances, which are the other two possible dialogue acts for question and directive respectively.

"
1736,hello. can you tell me what the procedures of applying for a job are?,"

Directive acts are used when the information provided is not relevant to the question asked. For example, if a person asks ""Where is the bathroom?"" and the response is ""Down the hall on your right,"" the act used is directive. This is because the person asking the where question did not need the answer to go to that bathroom. The same reasoning applies to this example: ""Can you show me the procedure of how to apply for job?"". 
  
Question acts can be used to ask for clarification. In this case, ""Who is going to do the picking at airport?"" is a valid question. Based on this question and text ""the boss"", the dialogue acts for this prediction are question (inform, direct, request, command) are:

inform: who is doing the pick at airpot? the employee
direct: the manager
request: please show the process of picking the boss at aeroport
command: let the Manager pick the Boss at Aeroporter
In this context, it is important to note that the word ""pick"" is used in the sense of ""select"" in this sentence. So the actual process is to select the ""boss"" at ""airpot"".

"
1737,"yes, of course. there are many steps. you can apply for the job on the internet and then send your resume to the e - mail address of the company. and wail the feedback of the company.","

inform is a prediction based on a large number of features. here, inform is used to describe the first sentence of a response where the speaker is providing additional details about the other kinds of tea besides green,black and scent. 
question is the second most common prediction, based only on text features, and is often used when the information provided is incomplete or when a follow up question is expected. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think question was the correct prediction.

"
1738,what is the qualification needed by the position?,"

Question acts are used to indicate a request for information. In this case, it is likely that there is a missing word or phrase that would provide additional context to the request. For example, ""i'd like to check that for myself, if that's ok with you"" could be interpreted as a question if the phrase ""if that"" is not present.

"
1739,you must have over 2 years'experience first.,"

Thank you. I am happy to help. 
This is because ""Thank You"" is a politer form of expressing gratitude. It is used to show appreciation for a service provided, and is considered polite. 
  In this case, ""No, Thank You"", indicates that the person speaking is happy with the response they received, but is not obligated to provide any further assistance.

"
1740,what did you do today?,"

Question is a dialogueact that is used to ask for information. In this example, it is unclear what the speaker did today. It could be that the event was interesting and they want to tell the story. Or it could have been a boring day and so they just want someone else to confirm what they did. Either way, they could use question to better understand what happened today, and inform for the actual content of what was done. 
  
Out of question: the dialogue acts out of the four options given are question and directive. Question is the most common dialogueAct, so it’s likely that this is indeed a question. However, there is no indication in the given text that it was asked by the author of that text. So it might be a directive or a commissIVE. Directive is less common than question but is still used in some contexts. For example it can be used as a way to emphasize a point. Commissive can also be considered as an option, but it seems unlikely given the context of sharing information from memory.

"
1741,played poker with my work friends.,"

This text provides information on a dish. The dish includes carp (a type of fish), rape (also known as jute), and mushrooms (which are a type). It does not ask a direct question about the ingredients of the dish or the method of preparing the fish or mushrooms, so the label of question is missing from the prediction. 
  
In addition, this is a social text. My work friend and I are both present in the conversation, participating in both the giving and receiving of information. Therefore, it is classified under commissives.

"
1742,did you win?,"

""yes, i did win"" is an affirmative statement, and questions typically seek information. 
overinform, questions, direct questions are all questions. question is the most common dialogueact. 
  question: did you won? 
      affirmative statement: yes,  i did won.  

Overinform questions can also be used to seek clarification. For example, ""why did they call you?"" is a overinformative question. The person might have meant ""who called you?"", but the question was too general. Overinform is less common than question and direct question; however, it can be quite common in informal conversation.

"
1743,of course.,"

 commissives are used to request information or assistance from another person. The recipient of the message is being asked for assistance, so the act would be commissIVE. 
  
Of course, I can provide room service.

"
1744,i'd like to withdraw some money from my account.,"

In the first sentence, ""i would like"" is a question. However, in subsequent sentences, it becomes a directive. 
""withdraw some"" and ""money"" are both statements that provide information. Thus, this is an example of directive information sharing. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I can understand that the directive dialogue acts are question and directive in this example.

"
1745,"can i see your passbook and the withdrawal slip, please?","

Directives are used when the person speaking is looking to carry out a task or action on behalf of the addressee. In this case, it is likely that you will find the pass book and withdrawal slips in the pocket of your suit.

"
1746,sure.,"

 commissives are used to request information or assistance from another party. The recipient of the message is the one who is commissed to do something. For example, if a restaurant offers to buy the customer a drink, then the restaurant is Commissing the buyer to accept the drink by saying ""okay, sure, that would be great!"". 
  
Out ofinform: This is used when you are asking for information, but you don't want to provide any information. An example of out of information is when someone asks you a difficult question and you do not know the answer. In this case, you would use out offormation to say ""I don’t know that answer, I’ll have to look it up"". 
   
Question: When someone is seeking information about something, and they are not sure if they have the correct answer or not. They are looking for confirmation or advice.  An example would a child asking their parents if it is okay to go to sleep. If the parent does not have an answer for the child, they would respond with a questioning tone of voice, such as ""is it okay?"". A dialogue Act of question is also used in a conversation when two people are debating an issue, or are trying to understand a complex topic. When one person is speaking and is trying explain something to another person, a dialogueAct of questioning is often used.

"
1747,let me just make sure. you want to withdraw one thousand dollars?,"

Question asks for an explanation. The person is asking for clarification about their request. 
Overinform: This dialogueact is overinform because the request is for one million dollars. This is a very large amount of money and the speaker is providing unnecessary information. 
  Question: ""how much?""
  Inform:  ""one thousand""

In this case, inform is the most appropriate dialogue tag.

"
1748,that's right.,"

In this example, ""allright,young man"" is a polite form of ""alright"" or ""okay"". This indicates the first person speaker wants to make sure the person being addressed is okay or is in agreement with what is being said. ""Tell me,"" indicates this is an order or instruction to a person to share information or a story with the listener.

"
1749,can i have a look at that digital camera please?,"

In this example, ""a look"" is not a request for information but a directive. The speaker is asking the listener to do something, namely to look. 
  

A:
According to the dialogue acts dataset, this is the correct answer: 
""No, I don't need to see it. I already have one.""

"
1750,yes of course. this is a really good one actually.,"

the text does provide information - it states that there are ""three in the family"" - so the dialogue acts of question and command are not applicable
it does ask - ""how many are there in family?"" - therefore question is the most likely dialogueact
of the options provided, inform is most similar to the provided information

If you would like to provide a response without revealing any dialogue-act predictions, you can use the following:
I am from the Netherlands and live in London. My parents are teachers and a working woman.

"
1751,how much does it cost?,"

Question indicates the asker is seeking an answer to a general question or a more specific question about the current situation. In this example, why is the question asking for an estimate of the cost. 
  
Overinform indicates a response is unnecessary. The askers intent is clear from the context, so there is no need to provide additional information. 
Quotation indicates an indirect quotation was provided. This is not the case here, as the original text was used. However, it is possible that a quotation mark was omitted by mistake.

"
1752,this one is 1500 yuan.,"

inform is used to describe a conversation that is not yet underway. It is a precursor dialogue action. In this case, it indicates that the two people are about to chat and that it does not matter which direction the chat takes. 
  
question is the first dialogue turn. The first person to ask a question is question. If the second person answers the question then this is commissitive. However, if the person asking the questions does so without an answer then the turn is over.  In this example, since there is no answer to the initial question from the other person, then question turns into a no-op. Therefore, this part of text is classified here as question and the entire text can be classified with this turn as commissative.   

directive is another precursor dialogue action that indicates the direction of a subsequent turn in the dialogue. Here, based on what the previous turn was, a new turn should follow in a similar fashion. That is, when the answer from another person is received, another question should be asked. When the location of coffee is mentioned, they should visit the coffee shop. Based on this, we classify this dialogue as directive.

"
1753,it looks pretty good. i think i'll take it.,"

Directive is the most likely dialogueact given that the request is for someone else to let the caller have access to something (the invoice). The caller is not asking for information, they are clearly not questioning the information they're being given, and they aren't expressing dissatisfaction or complaint. Instead, their request seems to be for the other person to do something for them.

"
1754,would you like anything else?,"

Question is a dialogueact that is used to express a request for information. The question mark indicates the asker is seeking clarification on a specific topic. 
  
Overinform is another term for affirmative answer. In this case, ""yes"" would be an overinformative answer to the question. 
Q: Do you want anything? A: Yes, I would like a coffee.

"
1755,that's all thank you.,"

This text can also be read as an acknowledgment of provided information, in which case it is not aligned with any of these dialogue acts.

"
1756,i need something to wash this down. is there any juice in the fridge?,"

Question: This text is requesting information, so it is a  question. 
  Inform: There is no juice, please check the freezer. 
Directive: Please clean the kitchen.  
Commissive : Please help me find the juice.

"
1757,what is that? it looks like something from a swamp!,"

Question is a special type of dialogue acts that is used to ask a question. It is characterized by the presence of a direct object (usually a person or animal) that the speaker wants the addressee to answer. 
  
  In this case, it is China that wants to know what tea is.

"
1758,it's a green drink. it's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals.,"

inform is a good classification as the first question in the above text seeks information. 
question is also a valid classification, as it can be used to replace the inform classification when the context is unclear. In this case, it could be interpreted as either a direct or a commissIVE request.

"
1759,"you know, healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag.","

inform: the dialogue acts inform and confirm are often used interchangeably, however, inform is used to describe a statement of fact, whereas confirm is a request for confirmation. In this example, ""healthy eating"" is being confirmed, not inquired about. 
question: although this is the most common dialogueact for questions, it is also used for statements of opinion or belief. ""Is healthy living possible?"" is typically a questioning statement, while ""I don't like the taste of healthy food"" would be a declarative statement with a querying dialogue action. 
  
directive: directive is often considered the opposite ofinform. A directive statement is usually a command or request, and the addressee is expected to comply. Directives are used when the sender wants the receiver to take an action, such as ""Call your mother now!"" or ""Stop smoking!"". However, directives are not used in statements that are merely informational. For example: ""The weather has gotten warmer lately."" is informational, rather than directive.

"
1760,"the sales lady said that even if i eat right, i wouldn't get enough vitamins.","

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the saleslady provided information, not a query, a direct order, an invitation to commit, nor a complaint.

"
1761,have you ever tried it? or are you just going to believe the sales lady?,"

Question: Have you tried calling the Lost and Found Office? 
  Inform: No, I haven't tried yet. 
   Question : Have You Ever Tried Calling The Lost And Found office? 
Independent: I have not tried. 

 

A:

This is a good question.  The text is asking the question ""Have you EVER tried?"".   The answer is ""No,  I haven’t tried."".    The question is informational, and the answer provides the information that you are not sure about.

"
1762,it's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day.,"

""it’s easier"" is an example of a factual statement. Factual statements are generally not conditional or hypothetical. They provide information about the world that is based on facts and are not opinionated. 
  
  ""this"" refers to the drink, and ""it is easier,"" in this case, is a comparative statement that indicates that the statement being made is more or less convenient than another. In this context, it is not a statement about whether or not the person should eat fruits and veggies, but rather a comparison of the two things. Comparisons are often made in casual conversation, so the speaker is expressing an opinion without using the word ""opinion."" 
   
   ""once a daily"" indicates a frequency, not an amount. ""Once a week"" or ""3 times a month"" are examples of frequency statements. Frequency statements can be factual, such as ""most tornadoes occur once every year"" (frequency: once per year), or they can express a preference, as in ""I prefer to eat vegetables once or twice aday"" (""frequency"": twice per day). 
     
     In this example, ""once"" can also be a word of limitation, indicating that something is possible but not necessary. For example ""It’d be easier if the car had an automatic transmission."" (""once"": automatic, frequency: never) 
    
    ""Easier"" in the example above is the comparative word, expressing that this statement is less or more convenient. The statement does not express an actual preference for eating fruits or vegetables, nor does it express that eating them is necessary for someone to be able to drive. It is merely a fact that it would be more (or less) convenient to do so.

"
1763,"it may take less time, but i don't know about easier. yuck.","

overinform: This dialogue acts is used when the information provided is not enough to answer the question asked. 
question: this dialogue is being used to find out more information. 
  question is also used in indirect questions. Indirect questions are questions that are asked to a third person. The third party is expected to provide information that answers the direct question posed to the first person
directive:  this is the most common dialogue in texts. It is a command that is given to someone to do something.  
commissive : this is when someone is telling someone else what to  do. They are giving orders.   

A:
According to your explanation, inform is overinform, so it is inform.

"
1764,"billy, you are late again.","

inform: Billy is late for class again, but this is not a complaint. 
question: Is Billy late all the time?  Does he miss class often?
directive: You are always late. You need to get your act together. 
  You are not Billy anymore. 
commissive : I know, I'm gonna talk to Billy about it.

"
1765,i'm sorry i'm late. i overslept. is the manager here today?,"

Question is a dialogueact that is used to seek information from another person. The text is seeking information about the presence of the person who is responsible for the call. Based on this, it is likely that the question is about whether the responsible person is available or not. 
In this case, inform is most likely the correct classification. Inform is an act that can be used when someone is late without giving any further information. 
  Inform: ""yes inmost circumstances.""

A:
(out  of inform, question, directive, commissIVE)
I'm not sure about this one.  I would say it's question.   The text does not commit to the answer, but it does ask a question and does so in a way that does commit.

"
1766,yes he's in his office.,"

This text shares knowledge or information about benefits fruits
  and vegetables provide to a human body. The text is neither asking

for information nor giving directions.

"
1767,"oh, i hope he didn't notice me.","

In this example, inform is the correct dialogue action given the context. The speaker is responding to another statement, ""oh"", which can be interpreted as a statement of hope. If the speaker had not included the phrase ""hope he did not notice"", it is likely that the listener would have interpreted the statement as an accusation.

"
1768,don't take any chances. it'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again. he's already mad at you for last 2 times. any more and he might fire you.,"

Inform: This is not a request for information, but a suggestion. 
Question: Who is ""he"" and why is he mad?
Directive: Give the rose to your spouse's Wife. 
  Commissive : I promise not be Late again, if he is mad, he should fire me.

"
1769,you said it. it won't happen again. do you really think he'd fire me?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact because it is an offer of assistance, and the response is needed to accept the help or reject it

A:
According to the model, it seems like the person who asked you if you needed any assistance is asking you a direct question.  
I would say that's a good reason.

"
1770,i think he might. you'd better go to his office.,"

Directive acts are used to tell someone what to do. In this example, ""you'd best go see his boss""

"
1771,you are probably right. i'll go right now and apologize. i try hard not to be late but it is difficult with beijing traffic.,"

 commissives are used when you want to give a command or order to another person. for example, ""you need to stop smoking"" or ""i want you to go to the store and get me some milk""

overinform,question,directive,overdirect,underinform
based on this passage, you are likely to see overinform or underinform. however, there is no question or command in this paragraph. it's more like a request for information.

"
1772,good luck!,"

Here it [the text] provides [information or something] to [recipient], which indicates that the message is an instance of the inform type. The absence of a request for confirmation or a demand for a response indicates the presence of information rather than a directive or commissIVE.

"
1773,how much is the rent?,"

Question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates that the speaker is asking for information. The sentence is a request for the listener to provide information regarding a topic that is already known to the conversation partner. 
  
Out of question: inform is an appropriate dialogue action for this type of statement because it provides the information that was requested. 
Directive: this is another appropriate action because this statement could be considered a command. Commands are not allowed in conversation. Directives are only allowed when spoken by a superior to an inferior. In this case, it is possible to consider the person speaking as the superior and the company as an  inferior. Therefore, a direct command is appropriate.  However, in this context, directives should only be used when necessary. If the command can be accomplished with less effort or less risk, then a commissIVE is more appropriate, as this implies that a more efficient or effective solution could have been found without the need for a formal commandment. However, if the solution is simply a matter of following instructions, using a Commissive is inappropriate. This is because Commissives imply that there is no need to issue a specific instruction, and instead, that an employee should be able to figure out a solution on their own. As a rule of thumb, Commissivos should not be given to people who are less capable than the one issuing the instruction. Instead, they should receive Commendations for accomplishing a difficult task.

"
1774,the rent is $ 1500 per month.,"

Overinform: This text shares information but does so in a way that does
not provide enough information to make an informed decision. For
example, it does mention that Chinese love tea, but it fails to
provide any context or statistics to support this claim. 
Question: Although this is a factual statement, there is no context
or explanation provided to help the reader understand why this
statement is being made. This is commonly referred to as a
question-without-answer. 
 Directive: While this may be a fact, this statement does little to provide guidance on how the user should act. In other words, while this provides useful information, without a directive (such as ""please do this""), it becomes just another piece of information that the recipient must sift through.  
 Commissive : While it may seem like this sentence is asking for a direction, in actuality it's a statement of fact that is not being asked for. The sentence does provide context and statistics, so the directive label is incorrect.

"
1775,and how much is the deposit?,"

Question is a sub-class of directive. Question is used to directly ask a question to a human. In this case, a machine learning model is being used. 
Directive is often used when a person is expected to take an action. For example, in a command and control scenario, an agent is telling a robot what to do. 
 Commisive acts are used after a directive to express agreement or dissent. This is because the speaker wants the listener to agree or disagree with what was said. Commiserative acts can also be used as a substitute for speech.

"
1776,the deposit is $ 500.,"

inform is a guiding behavior, which indicates that the speaker is providing information to the hearer, and is not asking questions or giving commands. 
  
question is another guiding or directive behavior. It indicates the questioner is asking a question and wants an answer. However, it does not specify what the answer should be. In this case, ""where can we chat?"" is the expected answer, but the ""we"" in the sentence could be replaced with ""you"" to indicate the person speaking is questioning the author. 
directive is also a directing behavior and indicates this is an order or request for someone to do something. ""We can go there and chat"" is directive, because it specifies an action that someone should take. The order is implied in ""there"". 
 commissIVE is one of four possible responses to a request or order. Commissive indicates someone is taking action, even if it may not be in accordance with their wishes. For example, if someone asks you to go to another room and you say ""ok"", you are indicating you will go into another area of your house. If the order was to stay in this room, you would be commissively responding.

"
1777,"is there anything else, apart from the credit rating and debt to asset ratio?","

Question indicates the author is looking for information. The question is about the other factors apart the two mentioned. 
Overinform indicates this is a response that provides too much information and may confuse the reader. 
  
  Question: ""how you stay away from those unhealthy foods?""

Answer:  ""There are many factors that go into staying healthy. One of the most important is to make sure you are getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, exercising, and not overindulging in food.  These are all factors in staying well and healthy.""

  Overinform: This response provides the information but may be too detailed for the question

 Question: How you  stay away  from those  unhealthy  foods? 
   
   Answer : There are  many factors  that go  into staying  healthy.   One of  the most  important is  to make  sure you're  getting enough  sleep,  eating a  balanced diet, exercising, and  not over indulging  in food.  Those are factors   in staying   well and   healthy

   Over inform: this response may  be too general and could be  too detailed

    Question : How  you  stik  away  those   unhealthy  food?  

     Answer  : There  are   many  factors   that  go   into   staying    healthy.   one  of  them  is  making   sure   you’re   getting  enough   sleep,   eating  a   balanced  diet,   exercising,    and   not  over indulgin   in   food .    those   are   factors    in   staying   healthy

 Overinform: too generic

"
1778,there is the balance of net liabilities. this must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years.,"

the text asks a recipient for information and is therefore classified in a category that includes question and question-mark (indicating seeking of information)
overall, this is a request for a factual answer, therefore the response can simply be a ""yes"" or ""no""

based on this, inform is most likely the correct classification.

"
1779,"right, ok. that, again, shouldn't be a problem.","

This text is suggesting an offer of a gift, and the receiver is being asked to consider it. This is a commissIVE offer, as it's being made to a person, rather than a thing.

"
1780,"and the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average, for that particular industry, for the first two quarters of the year.","

In this particular text ""sure. joh...."", it seems like it's providing or verifying information about ""john sandal"". So the dialogue action is predict inform and not question or promise.

"
1781,"well, as far as i can tell, we qualify.","

inform: over question
question: out of question and ask
directive: question out or directive
commissive (comissivo): out question or commissivo
over question: inform or question

"
1782,"of course we will need proof, originals and duplicate of everything. as soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it, it should be very quick indeed.","

Here it [the text] provides [information or something] to [recipient], which [is a] characteristic [of an] inform [dialogue act]. It [does not] ask [a question], give [commands], or [make promises], [which are] the [other types] of [ dialogue acts].

"
1783,do you understand any other foreign languages besides english?,"

Question is the most likely dialogue action in this context, as the sentence is asking the speaker a follow-up question. The speaker is likely to provide an answer that explains that she does not understand other languages, and that is why she can not drive.

"
1784,"yes, i know a little about japanese which is similar to chinese not only in culture but in language itself.","

""Surely"" is a word that can indicate confirmation, so the speaker is asking thelistener if what they said is indeed true. 
In addition, ""of course"", when used as an adverb, can also be used to indicate agreement or confirmation. So the same reasoning can apply here as well.

"
1785,what band did you pass in japanese language proficiency test?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact in this context. The question mark at the end of the sentence ""the band you passed in the japanease languageproficiencytest"" makes it seem like the author is seeking confirmation or clarification. This is reinforced by the use of ""you"" in ""passed in you japonese proficency test"". 
  
In addition, ""japanesearlanguageproficiencytest"", ""passed"", and ""question"" all appear in relation to the question being asked. 
   
Finally, there is a lack of context around the band. It is not clear from the rest ofthe text what band theauthor is talking about. Without this information, it is difficult to say for sure whether thequestion is being answered or clarified.

"
1786,"i passed the band two in lpt, but i will try to achieve band one which is the highest level.","

This text conveYS information about the difficulty of the exam. The 'passing the' part indicates that the candidate has passed a level-2 placement test, which can be achieved with a score of at least 24/30. 'But I will' suggests that even if the score is not good enough, he will still try his best.

"
1787,what seems to the trouble mr brown?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact, as the question mark in the beginning of your text indicates. The question marks in other texts in this passage also indicate that this is a general question that is being asked, and not a specific question about the man's health. 
  
  The man is described as ""seeming the troublesomest"" which could be a way to ask for clarification if the reader does not understand the meaning of ""troublesome"". 
   
""Troubled"" could also be the reason why the dialogue acts of question and directive are both classified in that section of dialogue Acts as being question or directive.

"
1788,"i ’ m in pretty bad shape, doctor ford.","

Overinform: This text contains too much information, making it hard to understand. 
Question: Is this the right room rate?  The text does not provide enough information to make a decision. The recipient needs more context to provide an answer. 
 Directive: Please provide the information again. Tell the doctor to continue.   
  Commissive : Please continue doctor. I’m in bad condition.

"
1789,"oh, in what way.","

Question: the prediction model has not been trained on this specific text and is therefore not able to provide accurate dialogue acts. 
Inform: this is a common text that provides distance and travel times between locations. 
  Based off of that information, it is possible to estimate the correct dialogue action.

"
1790,"no appetite, always unaged and i can ’ t sleep well.","

‘No appetite’ is an example of the negative form of a verb, indicating that there is a lack of something. The lack here is of appetite. Appetite is the thing that a person has, and if they don’t have it, they will not be able to sleep. 
  ‘Always unage’ and ‘i can’ ’t sleep’ are examples of negative statements. Statements like this are used to express certainty or strong opinions. In this case, ‘always unager’ implies that this person is not aging, while ‘ i c an ’’ t slep’ expresses certainty that they cannot sleep at the moment.

"
1791,did you lose any weight?,"

This text does not appear to offer assistance. It is more of an invitation to ask a question. 
  
  The phrase, ""May I Help You?"" does imply that this person is willing to help, but it does so by inviting the questioner to make the request, not by offering help directly.

"
1792,yes. i ’ ve lost quite a few pounds since last month.,"

""yes."" is a statement, not a request. It is not being asked of another person, but rather a confirmation of the information provided in the previous sentence. Therefore, ""yes."", when used in this context, is classified under ""over"" because the preceding information was ""more than enough"" to make a decision. 
  
  ""i've lostquite a bit of weight since the last months."" provides more information than is necessary to understand the meaning of ""quite"" in that it is too general and does not specify a time period. ""since thelast months"" is more specific and provides a more accurate time frame.

"
1793,when was the last time you have track up?,"

""The last"" is a relative clause that modifies the time of the event. It is an adverbial relative pronoun that indicates the relative time between two events. The last ""time"" the listener has heard from the person is when the conversation took place. This suggests the the dialogue has taken place recently, within the past few weeks.

"
1794,about two month ago.,"

overinform: this is not a request for information. This is an order or a directive. 
question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates that the speaker is looking for clarification. 
  Directive: it is possible that this was a command, but the command is for a subordinate to do something, so it falls under commissives. Commands are usually followed by a subject. Commissives, on average, are followed either by an object or by nothing.

"
1795,"let me take your blood pressure. you look anilic. well, mr. brown. i ’ m happy to say it ’ s nothing serious. you just a little run down from overwork.","

Mr. Brown is happy that Mr. Jones is not seriously injured. He is a bit run-down from working hard.

"
1796,what am i suppose to do?,"

Statement 1: ""my"" is a possessive pronoun. It is used to indicate that the name belongs to the speaker. In this case, it belongs the the Beijing address. 
Statements 2-3: These statements provide the year of birth and expected graduate date. These are facts that are not questions. They are statements of fact. 
 Statement 4: This statement provides the major field of study. This is also a statement of facts.

"
1797,i think you ’ ll needs just vacation. try to get out doors more. i ’ ll be sure if you get more rest.,"

Mary Jane is a famous brand of heroin. The word mari john comes from the latin for Mary and Jesus. So maries jones is also a popular brand. 
Ganja is an aniseed-flavored tobacco. 
  Grey market ganjas are usually sold in cigar boxes.

"
1798,"thank you, doctor. i ’ ll do what you say.","

 commissives are often used when someone is requesting something of another person. In this context, it is likely that you will be asked to repeat the procedure again, which is why the dialogue acts of commissiveness are directive and request a second time.

"
1799,"may i see your passport, please?","

Directive is the most likely dialogueact given the context. The passport is required for the visa process, and the officer is asking for it. 
  
Out of directive:

Question: may i - a verb? - see is an interrogative verb, so the question mark indicates a request for confirmation. However, there’s no request here for a visual inspection of the passport. 
Inform: please - an adjective - show is used to request information. Here, however, we’re not getting any information from the person, but rather sharing information that the government officer already knows. So inform is not the right choice.

"
1800,certainly. here it is.,"

This text can also be classified according to the following dialogue acts:
inform: seeking information
question: asking question
directive: giving instructions
commissive : making requests

In this case, it can not be determined from the provided text alone.

"
1801,"you are here on business, i think?","

Question is a dialogueact that is used to ask for information or clarification. The question mark at the end of the sentence indicates that the person is asking a follow-up question. ""When I spread this out, I found a small hole."" The speaker is confused about the meaning of what they just said. They want to know what the other person was referring to when the first person said ""I found something back here.""

"
1802,that's right. a german company has invited me for business talks.,"

the text does not explicitly mention any particular behavior the receiver should follow. However, it does suggest a good course for him to take. Therefore, inform is the most appropriate classification. 
  
On the other hand, there is a strong indication that a behavior change is what the sender is suggesting. The sender commits to write a presciption for receiver. This is typically done only when a person is being directed to perform a particular action. In this case, prescription is also a clear indication of a direction. Thus, we can classify this as a directive.

"
1803,how long will you be staying?,"

Question is a sub-type ofinform. Question is used to ask a specific question to a human being. In this case, it is asking the duration of the speakers stay. 
Overinform is another sub type of question. It is using too much information to be asked in a single question and causes the human to stop and think about what the questioner is actually asking. 
  In this example, ""how much time will he be stay?"". This is overinform because the length of time is the subject of conversation and not the purpose of asking this question
Directive is also a type  of question used when asking someone to do something.  This is what he should do. He should not do that. Directive can also be used in negative context to tell someone not to. ""Don’t do this"" or ""Stop"" are examples of directive used for negative purposes
Commissive  is a third typeof  question used  when asking for someone's help. Commissive questions can be positive or negative. Positive commissives ask for help in doing something, while negative commissivites ask someone else to help them do someone a favor. For example ""Can you help me with this?"" or  ""Don't do it yourself""

A:
(out) of (inform,question,directive,commissive)

"
1804,just two weeks.,"

overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both applicable, so inform is used. 
the dialogue Acts question and commissIVE are not applicable. Therefore, inform cannot be used as the act in this case.

"
1805,how many pieces of baggage have you got?,"

This text provides information regarding the number of pieces or baggage that an individual has. Therefore, this is a type of question. 
  
  The text does not provide any additional information that would allow me to answer this question; therefore, I believe this to be a non-question type response.

"
1806,"only one. in this case, i have a camera.","

In this example, I am giving the camera to you. 
  This is an indication that I'm giving you something.

"
1807,do you intend to take it out on your departure?,"

Question is used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision. In this case, it is likely that the person receiving the message does not know or does only partially know the topic of conversation. 
  

In this example, ""take it"" is an action that is being requested, and the receiver of message may not be aware of all the implications of that action. Therefore, in this context, a question is appropriate.


Out of question:
yes, I intend. 
No, not at all. I'm sure you know more than you let on. 


Directive: 我知道你很了解中茶
Commissive (also known as commissivo): I am sure that you do know Chinese Tea.  

"
1808,"yes, i do.","

Inform (inform, ask, tell, warn) is the most common dialogue acts in this context. Based on this passage, it appears that the speaker (the person asking the question) wants to know more about what is going on. Therefore, inform is a good classification. 
  
Question (question, direct, order, command) can also be used in similar contexts. However, in the context of the passage it does not appear that this is what the asker is doing. Instead, he appears apologetic and is seeking information from the listener. This makes question the best classification for this dialogueact.

"
1809,"according to the regulations, the camera you've brought along for personal use can be passed for the time being duty free, but you will have to take it out with you when you leave the country.","

According to Article 8 of the GDPR, a text is considered to be information, if it is 'provided in the course of a transaction or at the request of an interested party'. In this case, you are the interested person, as you need the device for your personal usage. Therefore, it can reasonably be considered that the information was provided 'at therequest of' you. 
  
However, this does raise the question of whether the regulation allows for this kind of personal travel with a duty-free device. The answer is no. According to paragraph 2 of Article 9 of GD PR, 'personal data' means 'data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person'. The GD Pr regulation does define a natural persons as 'any human being who can establish his or her identity'. Therefore the personal data of you, i.e. your name, address, email address and credit card details, is your data that has'relatesto an identifiable person', and you must take your device out of dutyfree when leaving the EU.

"
1810,i will.,"

This text contains a commissIVE statement (i.e. a statement that is intended to make a request or order). 
  Based off of the provided text and provided dialogue acts, it is not clear what the author's intention is. 
   For example, consider the following two possible intents:

(1) The author is expressing frustration at the driver for not being able to drive, and is asking the person to try harder. 
or
  (2) the  author is frustrated at their inability to understand the instructions they are being given, is questioning the validity of their instructions, making suggestions for improvements,  and is ordering the other person (the driver) to do so.

"
1811,well. have a pleasant stay in germany.,"

Well, have you enjoyed your stay so far?

It can also be classified inform because the speaker is asking a follow-up question to confirm that the listener has had a nice stay.

"
1812,thank you.,"

Inform: This is a request for information or assistance. 
  Question: Is this type clothing located in this region? 
   Directive: Please help me find it.  
  Commissive (sometimes used instead of directive): Please show it to me.

"
1813,excuse me. what should be included in my cv?,"

Question is a dialogue-act type that is used to ask for information or clarification. In this example, it is likely that the candidate is looking for more information on how to calculate the driving distance from London to Paris. 
  
Overinform is another dialogue action type which is similar to inform. The difference is that overinform indicates that a message has gone on too long and should have been divided into smaller parts. Here, over inform indicates the information provided is too much and needs to be broken up into multiple sentences. For example: ""i don’t think this is enough information to make an estimate, could you provide more details?"". 

Inform is the first dialogue - act type. This is typically used for giving information. An example of when inform would be used in this context is when the driver is asked for directions to a location. ""Turn right at the next traffic light"". Inform indicates a statement is being made and the person being spoken to should respond with what they think is correct.

"
1814,"generally speaking, a cv or resume is made up of 6 parts, personal information, educational experience, practical experience, personal skills, self - evaluation and job intentions.","

Inform is generally used when the dialogue acts of the given statement are not asking a questions, giving instructions or making promises. In this case, inform is the correct dialogue action to use. 
  
Question is used to ask questions or give instructions. However, in this statement, there is no question being asked or given. Therefore, it should not be classified under question. 
Directive is usually used for giving orders or instructions, and in the statement provided, this is not what is being done. Commissive can be used if the action being described is something that should be done, but the person doing it does so reluctantly or reluctantly. This is also not the case here. So, command is another option, however, since this action is performed willingly, that would make it a directive.

"
1815,what kind of personal information?,"

the text mentions ""all the"" photos. It's not clear whether the ""photos"" the author is referring to are all of the individual photos themselves or all photos in a collection. If the latter, then the question is whether all individual copies should be given. 
  If the former, i.e. the the authors are referring only to individual images, and the images are not part of a larger collection, than the information provided is not personal and therefore the inform part is unnecessary. In this case, since the only information is that two photos should receive two, it is classified here as a question. 
If all images in the collection should get two images each, but the original author does not want all copies to be made, this is a request or desire for something to which the person making the request is entitled. The request would be for the other person to give two instead of one. Since the asker is asking for a favor, they would use the commissives to request the action, rather than giving instructions.

"
1816,"including your name, sex, date of birth, height, phone number, and so on.","

In this example, inform is the correct dialogue action. The text is providing useful information about the situation, so the reader would like to know more. 
over: it is hot, it really is, let me take a look, I think it's a tie, actually it isn't
question: is it hot?
directive: take look
commissive : I'll take  a look.

"
1817,may i come in?,"

Directives are commands that tell someone what to do. This text does neither ask questions, nor give commands, so it is classified here. 
  
Inform is the dialogue acts of questions and answers. The inform dialogue Acts are used to find out information. In this case, it's the information of whether the person will be coming to the event. So, this is a good example of a text that uses inform to get information, not a directive.

"
1818,"yes, please. i ’ m mr. peter, the director of personnel. what can i do for you?","

Question is a dialogueact that is used when the information provided by the informer is not enough to fully understand the need or desire of the conversation. In this case, ""what can I do?"" is asking for more information.

A:
According to the dialogue acts Wikipedia page,
question is one of four possible dialogue Acts: question; question direct; directive; commissives.

"
1819,"nice to meet you, mr. peter. i ’ m wang sian. i ’ ve come for an interview as requested.","

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the prediction is based on information provided in the previous sentence. The sentence ""i’m wan siansian and i’ve come to interview"" is a confirmation of the name provided.

"
1820,"oh, yes. how do you do, miss wang? sit down, please.","

In this example, we can see that smoking is an option that is being discussed. The speaker, who is a woman, is expressing a personal preference for the smoking over the nonsmooking. Based on this preference, she is requesting the person she's talking to to choose between the two. Therefore, this is another example of a directive dialogue.

"
1821,thank you.,"

the text does provide information but does it ask for a response?
no, because it is sharing information

based on your explanation, I agree with the classification.

"
1822,what was your major in school?,"

Informative text: We don't have a major. 
Question: Why not? 



based on your explanation, I agree that the statement in the above text is informational in character.


yes

"
1823,i majored in public relations.,"

In the first sentence,'majored' is used to describe the subject of the sentence. 'Major' can also be used as an adjective to qualify someone or something. Based on this context, it is likely that 'public relations' was the name of her subject, and not an attempt to offer a description of who the author is. 
  
'major' also implies an amount, so the context of offering an'ounce' for 'free' suggests the offer is for a small amount. In this case, since the amount is so small, there is no need to be more specific about the size of an ounce, as this would be too specific. Therefore, inform is a reasonable prediction for the dialogueact of 'this text'.

A:
According to this website, ""Directive"" is the 4th most common dialogue Act in English.  ""Inform"" and ""Question"" are the most popular.

"
1824,have you done any work in this field?,"

Question is a dialogueact that is used to seek information from another person. This text is asking the person what about Soup? which can be interpreted as ""haveyou done work on thisfield?"". 
  
Overinform is another dialogueAct that can occur when someone is giving information to another. In this case, ""soup"" is the information and ""is a field"" which the asker is in. So the answer to the question is ""yes, I have done some workin this filed"". 
   
Another example of asking for information is questioning. ""Soup?"" can also be translated as a question. The askers is interested in the response and is therefore using question as their dialogue Act. 

Directive is also another possible dialogue action in question of soup. Here the message is clearly asking someone to do something. For example, if the sender is an employer and wants to know if a person is available to work, they could use directive as the dialogueaction.

"
1825,"yes, after my graduation, i worked in a trade company in macao for one year.","

the text is composed of pieces information rather then asking question or giving command or promising. 
it is not possible to classify the act as question because the information is being acknowledged and not questioned.

"
1826,what section did you work in?,"

Question: the use "" why"" indicating that speaker seeks information. 
  Out ofinform: because I was asking him for his license plate number. 
Inform: yes, I worked in the section 1.

"
1827,the export business section.,"

""They're are only 20 per 12"" is not a direct question or instruction. It is a sharing of information. 
Over-informing is the directive dialogueact, while over-questioning is commissives. 
  The text does not promise anything. So, inform is most likely the correct dialogueAct.

"
1828,so you must be very familiar with export procedures.,"

overinform: the dialogue acts inform and overinform are used to indicate that a response is too much or too little information. In this case, inform is used because the response given by the user is a detailed explanation of how to export data from a particular database. Overinform is therefore not used here, as the explanation provided is not information that is lacking. 
question: question is the second-most common dialogueact in English, used when a speaker wants to know something. The question mark is often used in place of the word ""how"" in questions. 
 directive: directive is another common English dialogue-act, which means that someone is telling someone else what to do. Here, it is likely that you will hear the person being told say ""you must"" or ""it is required that"". 
 commissives: commissIVE is an uncommon dialogue action in english, and is only used with certain verbs. These verbs include the following:
- command: command is typically used for verbs that are giving orders. However, if the order is to take an action that requires another person's cooperation, then commissived is appropriate. For example, ""John, you Must go to the store and buy milk"".

In this example the verb ""must"" is command, because it requires someone to go somewhere and take action, in this instance, buying milk.

"
1829,"yes, very much.","

Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are very similar, so it is difficult to tell which one was intended. 
Question: this is a good question and I will explain. The sender appears interested in the answer to their question; they are seeking confirmation or a reply. 
  Directive: although the message does not explicitly request a specific action, it seems like the author is expecting the reader to take some sort of action. For example, they might be requesting that you share the information they provided or asking you to confirm that they have provided you with accurate information. Commissive is also possible, but this seems less likely.

"
1830,that's good.,"

Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive: Out of these 4 dialogue acts, inform is the most likely one. The first two dialogue Acts, out are not applicable here. Directive and Commissive are only applicable when the other 3 dialogueacts are absent. In this case, since inform and question are both present, it makes sense that inform would be the likely dialogueact.

"
1831,"where to, ma'am?","

There is an indication that the speaker is asking a question. The use of the word 'where' indicates that this is a direct question to the listener. However, there is also a request for information, so it is not entirely clear whether the question is being asked by the addressee or the sender of text. 
Additionally, although the use the words'ma'amp;m' are polite, they also suggest that there may be a male addressees. This is unusual for a text sent to a woman, and may indicate that it was not written by a man but by another person. 
  

A:
According to this article, ""Where to"" is used to ask a person for directions.  So, I would classify this as a ""question"" because the ""where"" indicates a desire for direction.

"
1832,the grand hotel.,"

overinform: This is a correct classification, as the question is about something that is not mentioned in the previous sentence. 
question: this is also a valid classification as it is possible that this question was asked. However, it's more likely that it was a directive sentence, since the person asking the questions is the same person who is mentioned later in this sentence in a more directive way. 
  
outdirective: the classification is incorrect, because the sentence is talking about a hotel, not about cars. Cars are typically mentioned as an example of something one can use to go to a Hotel. Therefore, this classification would be for commissives.  

"
1833,the grand hotel?,"

Question: was there a grand Hotel? 
Overinform: yes, there was a Grand Hotel.  The hotel was built in the 1880s and was considered one of Bologna's finest hotels. 
 It was also the site of a famous brawl between the local mafia and the police in 1929. The hotel closed in 1932.

 

 

Why was the hotel called a ""Grand Hotel""?  
 There is no specific name for the building. However, it was one the most famous hotels in BOLOGNA for many years.  It was well known for its excellent service and beautiful architecture. Therefore, in Italian, ""Grande"" means ""Great"" and ""Hotel"" so the name was simply shortened to ""The Grand"".

"
1834,yes. do you know where it is?,"

Question is a sub-type of directive. Question words are used to ask questions, and directive words can be used when you want to tell someone what to do. In this case, it sounds like the statement is asking if the person knows where the high-speed train is. If the answer is no, then the speaker is likely asking a follow-up question.

"
1835,"no, madam. i don't think i do.","

In the example above, inform is the most likely dialogueact. The information provided is about free food, which is something that is available without cost and so it is likely that the speaker is providing information rather than asking a direct question.

"
1836,"it's the 11th avenue, park street.","

In this example, ""11th Avenue, Park Street"" is the location mentioned twice, and the number ""6.55"" appears twice as well. Based on these two pieces of information, it seems like the person is providing the information that there is a duplicate amount of money being billed twice at this location.

"
1837,"oh, yes. i know where it is.","

inform is the most likely dialogueact given the context of the conversation. The sender is seeking to understand the current state of affairs from another party, and so it would be classified here. 
  
question is a likely response given that the sender wants to know the information but is also seeking confirmation. It is possible that they do not have the drugs, or that it was not them who brought them, but they want to confirm this. This is an example of a directive dialogue.  The recipient is expected to answer the question in the form of question or confirm the answer in question form.   

 commissives are not appropriate in this context. Senders and recipients do  not typically engage in conversations where they both ask for information and then attempt to influence the other party. In this case, it seems like the message is more of an announcement than a conversation, so commissivedescribe the nature of it.

"
1838,would you like to order now?,"

Question is used to find out information. In this case, it is unclear what the question is. It could be asking the man if he is worried, or it could simply be a grammatical question. 
  
Out of question inform (question, inform), question can be used for both asking and telling. So, in this context, 'question' is being used as a directive command. 
Directive (directive, command) is a command or order. This is the most likely choice for this dialogue.

"
1839,yes. i'll have the shrimp cocktail to start.,"

Shrimp cocktail is a commissIVE (commissive) dish. The shrimp is the commissIV (commitment) and the cocktail sauce is commissively added (directly to the dish). The dish is not ordered or requested, it's just served.

"
1840,what would you like for your main course?,"

Question: I would like a main dish. 
Information: A main meal for you would be a roast chicken. 
  This is a delicious mainstay of many cultures. It is low in fat and high in protein, and is an excellent source of vitamins A and D. Roasting the chicken at home allows you to control the internal temperature of the bird, ensuring the best flavor and texture. The skin will also crisp up during cooking.

"
1841,"i'll have a steak, medium rare.","

In this example, inform is the most appropriate dialogueact given that the author is suggesting an action to take (i.e. 'i'd like to have steak' or 'you might beinterested in steak'). Inform is a directive dialogue action, as it indicates that a command hasbeen issued to someone. 
  
Question is not appropriate, since the question mark indicates uncertainty andindicates that there is more than one answer to this question. 
Directive is also not applicable, given the context of'suggesting anoption to' the person being addressed. This implies a request or order, not a suggestion. Commissive, onthe other hand, is appropriate here, because the writer is expressing a desire or intention to do something.

"
1842,do you have something to read?,"

Question is a sub-type of dialogue acts. The definition of question is ""to ask someone a direct question"". In this case, ""question"" is used to describe the type of information provided in the passage. 
In the given passage, it provides general information on Chinese love of tea. However, there is no direct information being asked. Rather, this is providing background information. This is classified under question.

"
1843,"yes, i do.","

In this example, inform is the correct dialogue action because it provides information that is non-question, noncommittal, and provides a positive outcome. 
  
  Inform is a more positive response than over, because inform indicates a desire for more information, whereas over indicates that the speaker is done with the information provided. 
Additionally, in this case, it is clear that 15% is an accurate number, so inform provides more detail than question.

"
1844,could you lend me one?,"

directive is a dialogue acting that indicates a request for a response or action. In this case, 
the speaker is requesting that the listener provide a book. 

 
question: the speaker isn't sure if the book is available or not. They are asking a follow up question to confirm if it is or if they should look somewhere else for the requested book
out  of inform: this is not a direct quote from the passage, but it seems like the author is suggesting that you look in a dictionary to see if 'the man' is actually a man. The speaker doesn't know if this book even exists, so they are using inform to suggest a course of action, and asking the question out of curiosity. 
 out question: yes, I have a copy of the'man and  the sea'.

"
1845,ok. here you are.,"

 commissives are used to express requests or commands. 
  In this example, a commissIVE dialogue acts as if the person asking for the pictures is actually commanding the photographer to take them.

"
1846,"thanks. it's rather cold this morning, wouldn't you say?","

Question is a conversation act that indicates that the speaker is seeking information from the listener. The question indicates the need for more information. In this case, it seems that there is not enough information in the provided text to determine the course or action of our conversation. Therefore, a question is being asked. 
  
Out of question: the information provided is sufficient to understand the direction of conversation, so out of is out. 
Inform: this is the default behavior for a dialogue partner, and it indicates to the other person that you are seeking their input. It is up to them to decide whether to respond or not. So inform is used in this example.  

"
1847,you're right.,"

the text expresses a rather strong concern, rather asking questions or giving instructions
it is a strong directive rather ask questions, give instructions or make commitments
over-classification of the act as question or directive

"
1848,do you know the news?,"

I pulled him over because he was speeding.

"
1849,which one?,"

Inform: This is a simple statement of fact. The speaker has not asked for any further information. 
Question: In this case, it is not clear whether the question is about the inform or the answer. It could be a general question about something, or it could refer to a specific person or thing. In either case it indicates a desire for more information, and thus a request for a answer
Directive: this is an order or a command. the person giving the order is likely to be in control and is expecting a response. 
 Commissive : this indicates an argument or discussion. it would be used in a conversation where two or more people are disagreeing or arguing.

"
1850,brazil wins the world cup.,"

based on this passage, Brazil is not seeking to acquire information, but rather asking the question ""What are Brazil's weaknesses?"". Brazil does not need to seek information in order to answer this question. 
  
Brazil does have weaknesses: it is a country with a large population and a small area, making it difficult for it to cover a wide area quickly. However, this weakness is common to many countries, and does Brazil need a specific weakness? No, it does it well.

"
1851,"yes, i see.","

inform: the first person is providing relevant information, so this is an inform dialogue action
question: there is the possibility that in the next sentence the second person asks a direct question
directive: this indicates that something should be done, for example the person should stop smoking
 commissIVE: it is not clear from this context, but it could be that a command is given in this sentence

In summary, inform is preferred over question and directive.

"
1852,we have the orientation this afternoon.,"

In the example provided, it is clear that the author is attempting to influence the reader's choice. The author suggests that they have another option to choose from, indicating that this is more of a question than a direct order. 
  
  Based off of the provided text and the options provided to the receiver, this seems more like a suggestion than an order, and therefore the dialogue acts are classified more as question or suggestion.

"
1853,what ’ s going to be covered in the orientation?,"

This text provides information about the next step in a process. The question mark indicates that the speaker is uncertain about what will happen next. 
  
  Based off the context, it is likely that this is a confirmation that you have completed the first step of the process, so the dialogue acts of question and inform are likely.

"
1854,"the company introduction, our mission, vision, various policies, insurances, pension plan, company id, batch, telephone, e - mail set - up and training.","

Overinform: the company does not need to answer the question. The recipient can simply answer ""yes"" or ""no"" to the provided options. 
Question: is the receiver able to provide an accurate answer?  If the answer is ""No"", the dialogue acts of request and request for clarification can be used. If the answers are ""Yes"", then the reply can use the directive dialogueact. 
 
Use the commissives if the information provided is not sufficient. For example, if a company is introducing various documents and policies but does not provide any reference numbers, then it is overinformative.

"
1855,quite a lot. all them one afternoon?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to ask a direct question. The question dialogue
  act is used when the information provided is not enough to answer a specific
   question. For example, a person might ask ""why?"" or ""what?"" when a friend explains
     why they are late or what they were doing. 
  
In contrast, inform and directive dialogue Acts are more general and are not
    used to directly ask for information. Instead, they convey information to
      someone else, such as ""let them know"", ""arrange it"", or  ""direct them to do it"".

"
1856,"yes, it is not easy.","

Out of question and question: the message expresses gratefulness and expectation for the future meeting. 
Over command and commissives: it does neither ask for anything, nor give commands, but expresses expectation and gratitude for something in the near future.

"
1857,it is ok with me. i enjoy being busy and learning new things.,"

the inform act describes the general course or manner of the communication, for example, 'let's talk about what you were going to say' or 'this is how we usually talk'.
question is used to seek information from another person, but the question in this case is not seeking information, it is asking a question. 
directive is a request for a person to take an action, and commissives are used for expressing disagreement or asking for clarification. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, you are right. The inform is the correct classification.

"
1858,"excuse me, could you please show me the way to the human resource department?","

Directive is the most likely dialogueact for this statement. The statement is asking someone to show them the direction to go to a certain location. 
  
Out of question (question), inform(outof question), question(question) and directive(directive) are the other possible dialogue acts.

"
1859,"yeah, but have you made an appointment ahead?","

Question: the dialogue acts are inform (telling), question(asking), directive (requesting a action), commissIVE (expressing a wish or desire). 
  In this example, it is not clear whether the person offering help has made a request for an action (e.g. an appointmnet) or is expressing a desire (i.e., to help someone in need).

"
1860,"yes, of course. i am monica. i have made an appointment with your hr manager.","

Overinform: the employee is giving too much information, and is therefore likely to say too little. 
Question: this is a good question!
Directive: please do as I say. 
 Commissive (subjunctive mood): please make the appointment.

"
1861,"just a minute please. i ’ ll make a call to the hr office. yes, they confirm your appointment. please come in. it is on the 3rd floor, room 3106. you can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today.","

Directive is a type of dialogue acts that are used to request or order someone to do something. In this case, it’s the receptionist asking the visitor to go to room #3106 on floor #2. 
Overinform is another type dialogue Acts that is used when someone gives information that isn’t necessary. Here, “tea is” the information is unnecessary. Directive overinform can also be used in requests or orders. For example, a directive overinformed person may be asked to leave a room because it was in violation of a social distancing policy.

"
1862,thank you very much.,"

the text indicates the speakers desire or preference

In this case, it is likely that inform is a good classification because the dialogue acts that do not match this pattern include question (which is used to ask a yes/no question), directive (used to give a command), and commissIVE (a combination of question and directive).

"
1863,you ’ re welcome.,"

This text expresses a worry about a lack of available outlets. This is an informational rather then a questioning or directive dialogueact.

"
1864,when can you get the finished product to me?,"

the text is asking a question
it is not providing any information, but asking for it
this is a directive dialogueact, asking the listener to do something

based on this, you can predict that the dialogue acts for this conversation will be question and inform.

"
1865,we should have it put together by the end of next week.,"

Directive is the most likely dialogue acts for this message. The message is seeking information, so it is likely that this is what the sender is looking for. 
  
Question is unlikely as the message does not seek information but rather asks for assistance. 
Out of the remaining options, Commissive and Directive are the two most common dialogue Acts.

"
1866,great! that ’ ll be ahead of schedule! good work.,"

Inform ( out of question, direction, commitment) is the correct response. The inform dialogue acts are used when the speaker is providing information to the listener, and is not asking for confirmation or assistance. For example, a doctor might inform a patient that they have cancer, but the patient is expected to confirm the diagnosis with the doctor. 
"
1867,"well, as the saying goes – we aim to please!","

inform is a prediction, and commissIVE is the most likely response. 
question is another possibility, but it is less likely. 
  
Question: ""do  you have  the man  and the  sea?""

answer:  ""yes, i do""
  The man is by henry washington.  I have a copy of the man of war in my office.   The sea is an ocean. I have swam in the ocean many times.

"
1868,have you got any cheaper ones?,"

Question is a sub-class of inquiry of the larger class of request. Question is used to seek information from another person or entity. The question word is usually followed by a subject or object that is relevant to the question. For example, ""Where is the nearest gas station?"" is an example of a request, while ""Do you have a gas can?"" or ""Are you going to gas up the car?"" are examples of questions. 
  
In this case, based on this example text and the dialogue acts predicted by the model, it is clearly a query.

"
1869,here are some. they're on special sale these days.,"

Inform is used when someone is giving information or telling you something. It is not appropriate in this context because the question is about how long it will take to travel to and from London. The speaker does not want to know the answer, but is instead seeking clarification so that they can provide the appropriate instructions or information. 
Question is the correct dialogueact in the example above. A question typically asks for clarification, and inform is a less specific form of asking. In this case, it is clear that someone will be giving directions, so question would be a better classification.

"
1870,that's more reasonable. i'll take this one.,"

Inform is used in the first sentence to introduce the topic of the message, room rate. 
Question is the next dialogueact used, based on your analysis, it is likely the receiver is requesting confirmation or opinion from you. 
  Directive is then used to set the direction of conversation, you are requesting the room type and rate, please confirm the rates.  
Commissive indicates the conversation has reached a conclusion, thank you for your assistance.

"
1871,good morning. what can i do for you?,"

Question indicates the author is seeking information from the receiver. The author does not tell the reader what to do, but rather seeks information. Therefore, this is a question. 
  
Inform indicates a request for information has already been made. However, since the request is for something that is not immediately available, it is considered a query. 
Therefore, based on this classification, we can say that this was a ""question"" but the ""information"" request was for a non-available good. It is therefore considered ""query"".

question: hey man you want to Buy some Weed? 

 

inform: yes, what are you having? 
   
query: i am having a joint, would you like to have one?

 
  
 
directive: Hey man! You want To Buy Some WeED?  

 

 

"
1872,i'm looking for some earrings for my wife as a wedding anniversary gift.,"

Directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used to ask for something. In this case, it is asking the person who is giving the gift for earings. 
Out of directive: actually, this is information that can be used in a question. The person giving this gift can use this information to make a decision. 
  Inform:actually fruits  and  vegetables are good  for you. This is knowledge that the recipient can take into account when answering the question of whether fruits or vegetables are better for your health.

"
1873,you've come to the right store. we've got a beautiful and wide selection of earrings for you to choose from.,"

the predicted dialog act was inform rather than question (or question rather
than question)

Inform (in a context of request for information) is used to request additional information or clarification. 
  Question (question in a negative context) implies a doubt or uncertainty.

"
1874,i saw a pair of earrings outside your window. can you show them to me?,"

Directives are used when someone is asking a person to do something. In this case, a human is being asked to show a friend something they saw outside. 
Inform is used for when a sender is sharing information. Senders may share information such as weather forecasts, traffic reports, and directions. 
  
Question is the next highest predicted label. This is because the statement is open to interpretation. The human may or may not be showing the earring to them.

"
1875,do you mean the exquisite pearl earrings?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to ask questions. In this example, 'how much is a room per night?' is the question. The response should provide the information that the author is seeking. 
  
Overinform dialogue Acts are similar to questions, but they provide too much information. For example: ""how are you?"" is overinform. ""I am fine"" is an appropriate response. Overinform is used when the response is too detailed or provides too many details.

"
1876,exactly. how much do you want for them?,"

Question indicates the speakers are seeking information or clarifications. 
Overinform indicates a lack of information. 
  Question indicate the information is needed. Giving instructions or promises indicates other types of dialogue acts.  

Without revealing which dialogueact the model predicted, you can explain that this is a good question to ask, as the questioner is looking for an estimate of the cost of driving to  London.

"
1877,they're only three thousand yuan.,"

In this example, it is clear that this is a suggestion or request for a future outting. The sender mentions ""Friday"" and specifies that they are asking you to join them for an out-ing on fridays. This is an indication that it was a direct request, rather than a question or a comment. 
  

A:
According to the GPT-3 model, this message is from a human. So the model is not 100% accurate.

"
1878,what is this setting made of?,"

Question acts are used to direct the flow of conversation. They are
  typically used when the listener needs to provide information or
answer a question. 
  In this case, it seems that this is a request for a suggestion or an
action.

"
1879,"well, it's specially made of a platinum alloy, sir, and the lustre will never fade out.","

Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are similar, so it is hard to tell which one was intended. The text does not provide enough information to make a decision. 
Question: this is a good example of when to use question instead of the directive dialogueact. In this case, we can see that the person asking for a copy of an invoice is not just providing the information, they are also asking the question ""why do you need a paper copy?"". 
  Directive: in this example, using directive instead is appropriate. We can tell from the context that this person is requesting a physical copy, which is something that should be done by a directive response.

"
1880,i'ii take them. please wrap them up tor me and give me the receipt.,"

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to request a
  specific action from another person. In this case, it's requesting the
person who is giving the drugs to wrap it up for the person receiving
the drugs.

"
1881,"you've made an excellent choice, sir.","

""Surely"" is a statement that can also be used as a preposition to introduce a condition or a fact. Based on this, ""Surelys of Course"" could be seen as the speaker seeking clarification or confirmation from the hearer. 
  
In contrast, if ""of Course"", ""Of Course,"" or ""For Sure"" were used instead, it would be more likely interpreted in a non-questioning manner.

"
1882,room service.,"

In this example, ""roomservice"" is providing the information that they are ""here to serve you"" and that ""soup"" may be of interest to the person asking the question. 
  
""room"" service is a service that provides ""accommodations"" or ""services"" to a ""client"". 
 ""service"", in this context, is defined as ""a person or thing that benefits or serves another"" (Cambridge Dictionary). 
 Thus, by stating that the ""servicer"" ""is here to service you"", ""the asker"" can be assured that whatever is being served is of benefit to them. This is an example of ""questioning"" as it seeks to understand the askers opinion on a particular topic. ""Soup"", on its own, does not provide any benefit or service to anyone. However, if the servicer ""serve[s] soup"" then it may provide a benefit in that it can ""be of service"" in the kitchen. Thus the answer to ""What about Soup?"" can best be described as a question seeking an answer.

"
1883,"good morning. this is room 113. i'd like some breakfast, please.","

There are statements in this message that provide information. The statements provide the name of the speaker, his/her place and date of birth, as well as his expected date for graduation and his major in college. 
  
However, there are also statements that are questions. For example, ""how are you?"" and ""what is your name?"". These statements are followed by a directive (""please"") which is not followed with another question. This is a question followed directly by another directive. 
Therefore, this communication can also be considered as a combination of question and directive and is therefore classified here as question directive communication.

"
1884,right. excuse me. mrs. jones?,"

This text is looking for information about how to pay for parking at the
parking structure. The speaker, ""mrs."" johnson, is likely seeking
clarification about the process of paying for a parking space.

"
1885,that's right.,"

the given  text expresses  gratitude and  appreciation for something someone did, and conveives information  about the feelings of the person who said it;
it does  not ask  a question  or give  any directive.

"
1886,what can i do for you?,"

Question: is used to ask someone a direct question. In this example, ""what do you want to do?""

Inform: provides background or information about a topic or event. This is not used in this context because the context provides enough information to understand what the person wants to accomplish. 
  
Directive: suggests a course of action. The person is asking the questioner to go do something, so this is the appropriate response. 
Commissive/commissive (depending on whether it is a request or a command): is an order or request for a subordinate to carry out an action, usually in the form of a directive command.

"
1887,"i'd like some grapefruit juice, marmalade, two scrambled eggs with two sausages, toast, and a pot of black coffee, please. how long will it take?","

""i’d like"" is a request, so it is likely a query. 
the ""some"" in ""grapefruit"" and ""a pot"" of ""black coffee"" suggests a choice of two items, which is typically a statement of desire. 
  ""grapfruit,"" ""pot of,"" and 'require' are all words that suggest a degree of urgency or necessity.  

In summary, ""i want some grapes, apot blackcoffee, now.""

"
1888,"just a few minutes, ma'am.","

This text demonstrates a desire for information, as well as a confirmation of what has already been stated. It does not appear to ask a clarifying question or give a directive. Instead, it appears as if the speaker is simply stating a fact, without any indication of a request for confirmation.

"
1889,great. thank you.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification because 15% is a small amount, and it is possible to achieve significant reductions in a short amount of time. 
  
  The predicted label for this response is question. The statement ""we’ve managed..."" is giving information, not a statement of fact. Therefore, it does not fit into the commissIVE or directive classification. However, since the reduction is significant, there is likely a chance that the reader will be interested in knowing more about it, so the inform label is most likely the right one.

"
1890,"hi, sam. i want to buy a pet. do you have any ideas?","

Question: the dialogue acts are question and directive. Question is used to find out information, while directive is an instruction to do something. In this case, it's asking Sam for information and then asking him for permission to purchase a new pet for her.

A:
According to your explanation, I think the reason why the prediction is question is because it is asking information from Sam and also asking permission from him.

"
1891,you really should go to rachel's pet store.,"

Directive is a special type of question that is used to ask someone to do something. In this case, it is likely that Rachel is requesting that you go with her to her pet shop, so that she can purchase a pet.

"
1892,why? anything special there?,"

Question dialogue acts are characterized by their being used to express a question or doubt, and are used in questions that require an answer. 
  
  Inform: This dialogueact is used when you are expressing information. You are giving or sharing information about something. For example, ""I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean."" 
   
   Question: ""Why did you do that?"" This is a typical question used with a doubt or uncertainty. ""You just did that to me!"" ""That's a very good question. Why?"" 
     
    Directive: When you use this dialogue-act, you want someone else to take an action.  For example:  ""Do it!"" or ""Go to the store and get some.""
     

  Directives are often used as a way to give orders.

"
1893,it's more than special. you can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more.,"

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the message is more of a status update than a request for information.

"
1894,"oh, really? are there any snakes?","

Question is used when the information provided is insufficient to make a decision. For example, a customer might ask a sales associate for help finding a specific product. 
  
Inform is when a speaker is providing background or context information to help a listener understand a topic. 
For example: ""It's the weekend, so there will be a lot of traffic on I-5. Be prepared for delays.""

When a person is directing another to do something, they're commissing that person to carry out an instruction. In this case, there is the implication that the person being commissed is there to pay for the item, but it could just as easily be the cash register. The person receiving the instruction is likely to be confused, and needs to know who is commisscing them to take action, in order to comply with the request. Therefore, this is classified here as commissitive.

"
1895,snakes? there are even rodents and monkeys! it's a world of exotic pets.,"

Snakes are exotic animals, but there is nothing exotic about snakes. They are in fact, animals like all others. The only reason the author chose to mention them is because they were late. If the topic of snakes were not mentioned, then the inform classification would be overstated.

"
1896,that's terrific. i can't wait to check it out.,"

Overinform: This dialogueact is used when the information provided is too much. It is often used in news articles or when giving too many details about something. 
Question: When the dialogue acts are not sufficient to explain the meaning of the context. For example, when a person is asking for information but the question is not clearly worded. 
 Directive: Used when you want someone to do something but you do not want to tell them what to. You can use this when asking someone for help. The person should do what you say, but they do need to know what is expected of them. Commissive : This is the most common dialogue action. When you are asking or telling someone what your expectations are. This can be used to ask someone out on a date, to help someone with a project, etc.

"
1897,hang on. are you sure you want to keep a non - traditional pet?,"

This is a rare example of question in this context. The recipient of the message is not sharing information with you, but is instead asking a detailed question about a personal matter. 
  
  The question is about whether or not the sender should keep their non-traditional pet. Based on their answer, it will determine whether the non traditional animal will be kept or discarded.

"
1898,why not? it's so cool.,"

Question is a conversation act that indicates a person is trying to get more information from the listener. The question mark in this statement indicates the author is unsure of something and is looking for confirmation. 
  
In contrast, inform is the conversation end, indicating that the speaker has provided all the information needed and the listeners are free to move on. In this case, there is nothing to confirm, so the question end is used.

"
1899,but it will pose a risk to your health.,"

Overinform: This is the most common classification for inform. The dialogue partner is asking too much information. 
Question: this is because the dialogue partners is looking for information, and this classification is most likely for a direct question from a conversation participant. 
  Question is also the first classification of the question dialogue acts. This classification can be used for both direct and indirect questions. Indirect questions are those that are asked to another person, for example, ""is it hot in here?"". Direct questions, on  the other hand, are questions that the speaker is directly asking to the listener, such as ""are you ok?"" or ""where is your car?"" 
   
  Giving instructions: is used when the asker is giving a piece of information to a listener. For example: ""turn off the lights"" or  ""open the door for me"". 
 Commissives: are used to make a promise or commitment. ""I promise to call you later"" is an example of commissivity.

"
1900,pardon?,"

Question: I trymy bestto eatonly fruits, vegetables andchicken. 
Overinform: i try toeat only fruit, vegetable and chiken.  
question:  i eat fruit, vegetable  and chicken
directive: try your best, eat  only fruit ,  vegetable and  chiken
commissive :  I try  mybest to  eat  fruit,   vegetableand  Chiken

"
1901,"i mean, most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria, they are likely to cause immune system problems.","

inform: This is information that is not true. 
question: Is this true?
directive: Do not eat them. 
 commissIVE: Don't eat the lizards. Don’t eat any lizard.

"
1902,"well, i didn't realize that.","

overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both applicable, so inform is the most likely choice. 
question: this is a question. The question mark indicates uncertainty. 
	Based off of the context, it seems like the author is unsure if the person would share information. Therefore, inform would be the correct choice for this act
directive: based off the provided context and the question marks, this seems to be a command or order. Commands and orders are typically commissives.

"
1903,"i don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets, especially for families with young children.","

inform is a suitable choice because the speaker is providing information about a fact or a situation. In this case, it is about the potential health risks of keeping animals in the home. 
  
question is suitable because it could be interpreted as a request for information. The speaker could have been asking a follow up question about whether keeping pets in a home with children is appropriate.  It could also be considered a statement of a belief. For example, ""i do not believe"" that keeping the pets is not a appropriate choice. 
directive is the most appropriate dialogue action. This is because this is an order or instruction. ""Let's Go!"" is likely a command from an authority figure.   
commissive would be appropriate if the person being spoken to did not agree with the command. If the child said ""no, we will not go without our pets"" then the parent would likely be commissing the children to go with their pets.

"
1904,"oh, i should have thought of my brother's baby girl. maybe i'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet.","

overinform: the model predicted that this was an inform dialogueact, however this is not a common way to communicate in this situation. Inform dialogue acts are used when the information is already known, and the person to whom the message is being communicated does not need to know this information. For example, if a person is about to buy a car, an informational dialogue is used to tell them what car model is best for them, rather than asking them which car to purchase. 
  
question: this seems like a question to me, but the dialogue model did not predict a query dialogue. 
directive: it seems as though the author is telling the other person what to do, which is a form of directive dialogue action.  Directive dialogue actions are often used in situations where the conversation is between two people who are not directly interacting with each other, such as in a meeting. The directive action is often to give instructions or directions to a third party. Directive actions can also be used between people in the same conversation, when one person (the directive speaker) is asking another person a direct question.

"
1905,"yes, good luck, maria.","

In the given context, it is not clear whether the flowers are a gift or part of the relationship. Therefore, this is an example of an inform text. 
  
If the context suggests that the gift is part the current relationship, then this would be an instance of question. In this case, asking the question would require providing information, and the answer would provide new context to help determine the nature of their relationship: ""the roses are part your partner's gift, so she will be happy"". 
   
On the other hand, if the suggestion is that this relationship is already established, than this could be considered a commissIVE text: the speaker is simply giving advice. The answer in this instance would not provide any new contextual information: she is merely repeating what the previous speaker said.

"
1906,"hello, this is room 1205. our message lamp is flashing.","

In the example above, ""flashing"" is an action, so the dialogue acts out of which are question and directive. The sentence is also asking a follow-up question: ""Please clarify what is causing the message light to flash."" This is another characteristic that makes this a proper question rather than an inform or directive text.

"
1907,"hold on a minute, please.","

This text is commissively acting. The speaker is asking the listener to do something, which is to hold on for a moment. 
  

In contrast, this is an informative text. This text provides useful information, without asking a query, giving a directive or making a commitment.

"
1908,thank you.,"

inform: This is not a request for information; it is a command. 
question: Is this a proposal? Is there a deadline? 


"
1909,i am sorry to have kept you waiting. mr. johns needs a telephone call from you.,"

This text indicates the requestor is directing or guiding the dialogue towards an outcome. This is a characteristic directive act, as opposed to a question or commissives. 
  
  The request is for a phone call on fridays. The request comes at a time when the receiver is likely to be receptive to the idea of having a call. It is also possible that this is the only time the two parties will be in contact for the rest of the week.  This is an attempt to get the person to commit to doing something for them.

"
1910,would you bring the message to my room.,"

This text indicates that the speaker is trying to persuade the other person to go to their room, so the classification of the dialogue acts is correct.

"
1911,i'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment.,"

This text indicates the need for an answer, so the prediction is question. 
However, there is a request for information, as the ""I didn’t think..."" is followed by an offer of an explanation. Therefore, this is an example of over-prediction, where the system predicts too much.

"
1912,then i'll come down and pick up the message immediately.,"

Directive is a special kind of question that is used to request a
service or action from another person. The person being asked a direct
question is called the direct object. Directives are used in sentences
like ""Would you like a drink?"" or ""Please pass the salt."" Direct
questions are often followed by a request for a response or a command.

"
1913,"ok, we wait for you.","

This text indicates the requestor is instructING a person to do something. Therefore, it should be classified a commissIVE dialogueact. 
  
  The text ""we wait"" indicates a state of being, not a command to execute a specific action, so it cannot be a directive dialogueAct.

"
1914,guess what? i've got great news!,"

Inform is used to ask for information. The person asking the question is looking for more information, so the label inform is appropriate. 
Question is another way to request information from another person. In this case, it is a person seeking clarification about the other tea types. 
  

question: is there any other type of tea besides green and black?
yes there is, there's a type called scentsed tea.

  yes. there sure is. scENTSED tea

 The label question can also be used for a different type  of conversation where the speaker is expressing uncertainty about something. For example, ""are you sure that's the right house?"" or ""I don't know if this is the best route to take.""

 question: am i sure this house is right?

 yes, this looks like the house i was looking at earlier. this must be it. i'm pretty sure. it looks familiar. the address is correct. but i could be wrong. you might want to check with the owner. they might know for sure

 the owners name is john smith. he's in the kitchen with me right now. we're going to go check it out. let me know what you think. thanks!

"
1915,what is it?,"

In the first sentence, it is clear that Gratitude is being expressed. The speaker does not mention anything negative about the delay, so it can be inferred that they were not expecting the arrival of the message. 
However, in the second sentence the apology is offered. This indicates the sender was expecting a message and was late. 
  This is confirmed by their use of past tense in 'was late'. 
   In addition, they are using the present tense of 'apologize' in this sentence.  

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue: A Theory of Meaning"" by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, there are five basic types of dialogue acts: question/comment, command/request, request for information, order/direction, offer of information.

"
1916,"well, you know how i've been working at the economist as a proof - reader, right?","

Question is the most likely dialogueact given the context. The text asks the person to explain the reason for the prediction. 
Overinform: the Economist article is not available online, so the author is probably over-interpreting the passage. 
 question: I want you to tell me why you think so.  
Directive: Please change it from 28 to 24. (This is an order, not a question.) 
 Commissive : I will try.

"
1917,yes.,"

the given textual evidence conveives information on speaker’s feelings;
without revealing dialogue-act label, it is useful to mention that the given evidence does express gratitude, appreciation, and so on.

"
1918,"well, the editor - in - chief heard that i had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if i was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him.","

As an experienced assistant at a magazinet, i would be happy to become an Assistant Editor at Magazineman.

"
1919,really? that's fantastic! will you get a chance to do any writing?,"

Question is a sub-class of dialogue acts that are used to ask questions. In this case, ""question"" is used as a verb to describe the action of providing information. The taxi driver is on a strike, not asking a ""strike"" or ""being on"" a struck. Rather, he is providing the information that he, a taxi-driver, is currently on, i.e. on foot, on taxi strike. 
  
Out of question: the taxi operators are striking again
Inform: taxi operator is striking
question: is taxi striking?

"
1920,she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that i could be in charge of the column until she came back.,"

Overinform: This is an overstatement, as the writer is clearly not seeking an assessment or evaluation of how bad I did. 
Question: the question mark indicates that this is information seeking, and the ""bad"" in the quoted text is the subject of inquiry. 
  Directive: this would normally be the case in a conversation between two people, where the one asking the questions is also in control of what is being asked. In this case, however, it is clear that I am being told what to do by the person who is going to be on leave. Commissives: I do not see any promises or commitments being made in this passage.

"
1921,wow! that's really great news. how often does the magazine come out?,"

Question is used when the information provided is insufficient to make a decision. For example, a customer service representative might ask a simple question to clarify an order. 
  
In contrast, direct speech is when a speaker is giving orders or instructions to another person. The person receiving the order or instruction is then expected to obey it. In this example the customer representative is using question form, but the actual dialogue acts are directive.

"
1922,"it's a monthly magazine, but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly.","

In this example, ""understand"" is an affirmative statement that conveys the author's understanding of the topic. Therefore, inform is a suitable classification for this dialogueact.

"
1923,are you looking forward to doing more editing work?,"

Question: are you excited about the opportunity to do more editorial work on this project? 
Inform: We are excited to take on more work and are looking to expand our editorial team. 
  

A:
According to the Stanford Corenlp natural language processing toolkit, ""question"" is a subcategory of ""inform"" that includes questions that are ""factual, declarative, and hypothetical"".
So, in this case, it's most likely that the ""we"" in ""We've reduced ourenergy consumption"" are the subject of the sentence, so the answer would be ""yes"", the team is excited.

"
1924,"yes, but i'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again!","

Overinform: This dialogue acts is used when the information provided is too much. For example, if the employee is told to clean the kitchen and the employer is given a detailed tour of the entire house, then the overinform dialogue action would be used. 
Question: If the dialogue is not followed by a response then this is a questioning dialogue. This is because the speaker is asking a follow up question. 
  For example: ""Do you want me to start cleaning the Kitchen?""
Directive:  If the  dialogue is followed  by a reply then  this is  a directive dialogue  as the reply is an order.  
For  example:   ""Yes, start  cleaning the   Kitchen.""
Commissive  : Finally,  if the response is the same as the question then it is commissitive.   
  This is usually used  when the answer is no. The response  is a no answer.

"
1925,do you have any order forms here so that i can get a subscription to the magazine?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact in this context. The question mark at the end of ""subscription to"" indicates the reader is expected to ask a follow-up question about this topic. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, it is a Question.

"
1926,"i don't have any with me, but i think i could manage to bring a free copy home for you.","

Directive is the most likely dialogueact for ""How?"". ""What"" is a verb, so it is likely that "" How?"" was intended to provide a directive response. 
  The text is also seeking clarification, which is another reason why it may have been interpreted as a direct question.

"
1927,i'm really looking forward to reading your column.,"

overinform: the dialogue acts inform and overinform are used interchangeably to indicate that a message contains too much information, or too little information
question: question is the most common dialogueact in written communication, used to ask a simple yes/no question
directive: directive is used when a person or organization is requesting something of another, for example, a request for information or a recommendation
 commissIVE: commissives are often used in negotiations, when one side (the commisser) makes a proposal and the other side makes an counter-proposal. The commissiver will ask questions to clarify the proposal, and then make a counterproposal based on what they learned from the questions.

"
1928,"me, too. do you want to go out to celebrate my good news?","

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to express orders or instructions to a person or group. 
  
  - Directive acts are often used in negotiations or in situations where one person is asking another for a favor. In these situations, it is often difficult to get the other person to agree to do something without giving them a sense that they are being ordered to take action.

"
1929,"sure, where would you like to go?","

Question is the most likely dialogueact in this context. The question mark at the end of the sentence indicates that the speaker is asking a follow-up question. 
  

Where would  you like  to go ? 
 - The dialogue  act of  this text is question  (over  inform,  question,   directive,    commissive)
 -  The  speaker  is  interested  in  knowing  the  dialogue  actor  of  next  sentence.  It is a  follow- up  query.   
  -  They  are  going  out  dinner  tonight.    The   speakers  wish  they  were  asking, ""where are we going to dinner tonight?""  This is  a  request  for  specific  information.

"
1930,perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop.,"

Directive is a dialogueact that indicates that the speaker is giving orders or making a request. The speaker in this example is providing specific details about a hotel, and it's likely that they are giving directions to where the hotel is located. 
  

overinform: This dialogue acts indicates the information provided is not enough to make an assessment. Inform is used when the context is already aware of the facts being shared. For example, if a salesperson were to say ""this car is the best car you can buy right now"", the listener would likely assume that this car has already been tested and is known to have the highest safety ratings. However, in the example provided, there is no context that would make the details shared by the first person relevant to their assessment of value. 
question: this dialogueacts indicates there's a missing piece of information that is needed to assess the value of what is being discussed. This is often used in a conversation where two people are debating a point and need to find a way to come to a consensus. If a friend were telling me that she was going to buy a car, I would want to know the make, model, year, color, engine size, price, etc. before I could make any judgements about whether or not it was a good purchase for my friend. Without this information, it would be difficult for me to determine if the purchase was good or bad for her.  This is also a common dialogue action in questions about politics, religion, sports, current events, personal experiences, social issues, business, education, parenting, sex, love, hate, friendship, work, travel, entertainment, fashion, food, art, philosophy, science, technology, innovation, ethics, morality, law, justice, fairness, equality, discrimination, racism, classism, ageism. etc..
directive: In this case, this is an indication that there was information shared that was sufficient to understand the assessment, but the receiver chose not to act on it. A good example of when this happens is when a person is shopping for a house and the seller shares information such as the square footage, number of bathrooms, type of roof, water heater, furnace, electrical panel, wiring, plumbing, HVAC, roofing, windows, doors, insulation, drywall, flooring. Based on this, a buyer may decide to go look at a property, decide it isn't a great fit for them, then the buyer doesn't follow up to see if there are any other properties that meet their criteria. Directive indicates a choice was made, not based on information being provided but on other factors.

"
1931,have you seen the new cosmo magazine that i was reading this morning?,"

This text indicates the question is being asked by a person who is looking for something. Cosmo is a magazine, so it is possible that this person was browsing through the magazine and came across the article. 
  
Without revealing any dialogue acts in my response I will explain that it makes sense that a new magazine would be available at the location of your text. The location could be a store, a library, or a newsstand.

"
1932,i think i may have seen it on the kitchen table.,"

Inform is a guiding dialogueact, as it indicates the sender is attempting to provide the receiver with additional information. 
Question is an interrogative dialogueAct, indicating the speaker is seeking clarification. 
 Directive is the most likely dialogue Act, since the author is trying to influence the reader's choice. Commissive indicates a dialogue between two parties, where neither is necessarily trying influence or guide the other.

"
1933,"you're right, thanks. there's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that i want to finish.","

inform is a prediction based on a model trained on large amounts of text. it is an intermediate step before a reply is generated. inform is used when the dialogue acts are not fully understood. 
  
question is one of the four possible dialogue actions. the model predicts inform if it does not understand the current dialogue action. question is also used to seek clarification. for example, ""are you sure?"". 

A:
According to your explanation, I think that question was the right prediction.

"
1934,who's the director?,"

Question is a dialogueact that is used to ask for clarification or information. 
In this example, ""actually"" is the question. The director is likely to clarify the meaning of the statement by providing an answer.

"
1935,"it's martin scorsese. you liked his film, the departed, didn't you?","

Martin Scorssese is a famous film director. Based on this statement, it is possible that the author of the response is also a fan of his films. 
  
If the statement is not a request for confirmation, then it's not possible to classify it as a direct question. The statement can be interpreted as an expression of agreement, similarity, confirmation or even as confirmation of similarity.

"
1936,"yes, it was fantastic! can i read the article when you're finished?","

Directive is a special type of question that is used to request a
service or action from another person. In this case, asking the
author of the passage to read a passage when she is finished is
considered a directive question:

""Please read passage #3 when it's finished.""
- Directive question
In this example, ""when it’s finished"" is the directive object.

"
1937,"sure. you know it has an online edition, too. you should go online to read if you want to read it now.","

the text indicates the person is being given information, and not asked a
question;
it is a directive act, as opposed to a commissIVE act.

"
1938,"that's ok. i'll wait until you're finished. just out of curiosity, do you have a subscription for that magadize?","

Question is a dialogueact that is used to seek information or ask a clarifying question. In this case, it appears that the question is being asked to gather more information. 
  
Out ofinform: This is an outoffielddialogueact used when the conversation is about something other than the topic of the communication. 
In this example, Magadine is not the subject of conversation. The person asking the questions is. Therefore, outofrm is the most appropriate dialogueAct.

"
1939,no. i don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile.,"

""I don’t buy [it] regularly  enough for  it to  be worthwhile."" is an example of the opinionated text type, and therefore it is classified under inform. Opinions are notoriously difficult to quantify, so it's difficult for a machine to know whether or not the user agrees with the statement without context.

"
1940,how much does the magadize cost?,"

Question indicates a direct and clear question that aims to obtain information from the listener. The question in this example is about how much the Magadise cost. 
Inform indicates the information is being provided by the addressee. In this case, Magadanize is the sender and the cost is what is asked about. 
  
Directive indicates there is a request from Magadenize to the reader to take some action. This could be to buy the product, or to do something else. Magardenize wants you to go to a website and buy it.  The website is requesting that you buy Magadalize.   

 commissIVE indicates Magadelize has asked you a personal question and you are responding to that question. You are telling Magandelize how expensive Magalize actually is.

"
1941,"it's almost three pounds now, and i think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon.","

It is unlikely that a four pound price increase is imminent. 
  The price of the book has increased by only three pennies so far this year.

"
1942,that's quite expensive. who is their target audience?,"

Inform is used to describe statements that provide information about the characteristics of a thing or person. For example, ""the price of that car is quite high.""
Question is the first of four dialogue acts used in conversation to probe for information or to request clarification. ""Is that price high or low?""
Directive is a directive act used when one person is expected to take an action. In this example ""I want to buy that""
Commissive acts as a way to express regret or apology. This act can be used after asking for forgiveness. 
  ""I'm so sorry I asked you to do that.""

"
1943,"cosmo mainly has a middle - class readership, but i think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore.","

In this example, inform is the correct classification because it provides the reader with information, which is not a request for a response. The reader does receive the information in the form of facts, and it is presented in a non-committal manner. 
  
However, if this were a more directive or commissIVE text (e.g. asking the user to buy a car, make an appointment, etc.), then the classification would change to question (or directive/commissive if asking for an action).

"
1944,"i bet you'll still buy it, though. you wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine!","

overinform: This is a prediction of the next most likely dialogue tag given the current context. 
question: Is this a real request?  If not, then the response should be different. 
  directive: Someone can go to the location specified and help them. If this is not a genuine request, you should inform the person that they need to provide more information.  
 commissive : I will go and see if I can help.

"
1945,wei! this is a first - you didn't bargain!,"

In the example provided, there was a potential change to the timeframe, so the dialogue acts were classified inform rather than unless. 
  
Without revealing which dialogueact was classified out of the four possible choices, you can explain that the information provided was enough to change the response.

"
1946,bargain? i'd feel way too guilty.,"

This text is expressing a negative sentiment, suggesting that there is something wrong with the idea of bargaining. This is further supported by the use of the word 'guilt' in the last line of your predicted response. 
  'Guilt? I'dfeel waytoo guilty.' 
   Basedon the context, it is clear that 'bargin' is not the speakers idea, but rather the other person's. The use 'I'd' suggests the person is feeling guilty for thinking of barging.

"
1947,but you could have saved money.,"

Inform is the most general dialogueact, indicating that the speaker is providing background information or setting the context for their communication. 
Question is a more specific dialogueAct indicating a request for information. 
  Question can also be used as a negative sentiment indicator, as negative question words tend to be more negative-sounding than positive question word. For example, ask instead of the positive ask, and the question will sound more skeptical or negative.

"
1948,"from a sweet ma?! it's not worth it. plus, i'd happily pay more for these things i bought!","

""do think"", indicates that sender wants the answer to a hypothetical question. 
the question marks at end of the sentence, indicates the question is hypothetical. 
  

A:
According to the model, you are asking if you could make your self understood.  If you were to answer yes, it would be worth paying more.

"
1949,"f. y. i., there is a flea market nearby, but maybe you're done...","

overinform: This is an overuse of the inform dialogue action. The question is not seeking information, it is seeking an explanation. 
question: the question seeks information. 
  
  Directive: I am done, go to the fleamarket.  This is the command form of directive. It is used when the person asking the questions is also the one answering. In this case, you are the answer to this question. Directives are used to give orders, requests, or suggestions.

 commissives:  I am not sure if I'm done with this project, I may have left something undone. I could be done after I finish this task. Commands are often used in commissivo dialogue acts when giving orders or instructions to another person, especially when that person is in a subordinate position. They are not used as much when asking someone to do something. 

"
1950,ha! i'm just warming up! please take me there now!,"

This text is providing detailed information about the situation. It is not a request for a recommendation or a suggestion. 
It is also not making promises or statements of fact. 
  It seems more like a command.

"
1951,can you help me do an internet search?,"

the text contains a request for help in doing an Internet search, indicating that it is the asker who is directing the response;
based on context, it seems that this is a common request among the group of people sitting around the table, and the request is being fulfilled by the person who has the Internet connection at the moment.

"
1952,sure. what do you want to find?,"

Question: the question mark indicates the dialogue acts are not clear. The speaker wants to know what the answer should be. 
Information: providing an accurate answer would be information. 
  
  Directive: giving orders or instructions.  The speaker might be asking the driver to take a specific route or to stop at a particular place.   
Commissive : making promises or giving advice. It is possible that this is what is being asked for, but it is not entirely clear from the context.

"
1953,i want to find information on the american civil war.,"

In the given context, it is not clear whether the author is asking a question or sharing information. If the latter, then the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the start of a new sentence, in which case the information provided in the previous sentence is being repeated. Alternatively, if the writer is simply sharing a piece of information, without asking for confirmation or clarification, than the word ""yes"" at end indicates a confirmation of that information (which is also consistent with a request for clarification). 
  
If the former, this is an example of what is known as ""as-if"" language, where the meaning of an utterance is assumed to be the same as the intended meaning, but the actual meaning is different. This is a common technique used by speakers to make their meaning clearer, especially when the context is unclear. For example, ""I'm going to the store. I'll be back in an hour."" is often interpreted as meaning ""Don't leave the house. Be back within anhour."".

"
1954,"well, can you be more specific? there are a lot of websites about that.","

Directive is the most likely dialogueact for this context. The speaker wants the other person to do something, so they are making an order or request. 
  
Overinform: the directive act would be classified here if the person giving the information also provided more information, for example, ""it sounds good, let me show you some examples of the options we have.""
Question: this would apply if someone asked a direct question like ""how do you know what to order?""
  Directly order someone to something: ""let's order the fish and chips!"" is a command, not a request for information. 
Commit: if a person were to make a promise or a bet, this is not the right dialogue action.

"
1955,"yes, i want to know about the battle of gettysburg.","

In the example provided, it is clear that the requestor is asking someone else to do something for them. This is typically an act associated with a commissIVE dialogue tag. 
  
  The request appears as though it was made by the person asking for the item, but it could also be interpreted as a command from a superior to an inferior. In this case, a question would be more appropriate.

"
1956,"o. k. well, go to google. com, and type in “ battle of gettysburg. ”","

Directive is a sub-class of question and inform. The sentence “go to Google.com and search for ‘Battle of Gettysburg’” is an example of directive. A directive sentence is one that conveys a command or order. 
  
Question is another sub class ofinform. “Are you free tomorrow at 10am?” is considered a  question.  A question sentence asks a yes or no question to a statement. In this case, “are YOU free TOMORROW at10AM?”

Out of the four choices, this is the closest to what the question is.

"
1957,"oh wow, there are a lot of sites.","

Because the provided text does provide information, but does NOT ask any questions, command or promise.

"
1958,"here, try this one. it ’ s a good site about gettysburg.","

Directive acts are used to give orders or instructions to another person. The recipient of the message is told what to do or where to go. Directive is used in a command or request form. 
  
In this example, a hotel would use a directive act to tell the guest that they have a room available.

"
1959,thanks.,"

inform: the information is not very specific and could be answered with more information. 
question: is a simple request for an explanation. The question is also followed by a request of an additional explanation which makes this a complex question
directive: this is an instruction to do something. It is usually used in a negative context. For example, ""stop smoking"" or ""eat your vegetables"" are examples of directives. 
 commissives: these are used when you want to express your feelings towards something or someone. Commissives are also used to emphasize a point.

"
1960,"for detailed information, however, you should read a history book.","

Sure, John sandALS. is a confirmation of something John said. 
  It is not a request for information.

"
1961,"thanks. if i ’ m interested, i ’ ll go to the library.","

In this example, 'go to library' is a directive command. The taxi driver is telling the person who sent the message to go and visit the nearest library, which is likely a public library or a community center. 
  
Without revealing this dialogueact label, you can say that the taxi-drivers' strike is an ongoing event, and the driver in this case is conveying the information that it is currently ongoing.

"
1962,i just have to come up for air. i ’ ve been here for too long a time.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification, as the dialogue acts inform and question are used interchangeably in English. Inform is used when the information being provided is not sensitive, and is being given to a person who is knowledgeable about the subject. Question is when someone is asking for information, whereas question is only used to ask a question when it is a direct question. Directive is reserved for when a speaker wants another person to take an actual action. Commissive can be used in either case, but is typically used for expressing agreement or consent.

"
1963,ok. you ’ d better come back in two hours.,"

Directive is a special type of question that is used to request action or a response from the person or entity to whom the question is addressed. In this case, ""you’ dbetter comeback intwo hours."" is the directive verb, and ""come back"" is its object. The directive is requesting the speaker to return the listener's call in a specified time.

"
1964,good afternoon. i'd like to speak with tom smith.,"

Directive is a directive act, meaning it is used to give orders. In this case, it's telling you to call Tom Smith. 
  
Inform is the most common dialogue acts, and it describes when someone is giving information to another person. The sentence provides the information that Tom needs spoken to, but does NOT tell Tom what to say. So, inform is most appropriate.

"
1965,i'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment.,"

Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the one that best describes the meaning of 'does sound good' in this context. The statement ""does sounds good,"" when taken alone, does not provide any information. However, when considered in context, it is clear that the statement was meant to provide information to the person who asked the question.

"
1966,do you know when he will be back?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact in this example because of the use of do you Know when He will Be Back? The speaker wants to know if the addressee knows something. This is an interrogative sentence and therefore question.

"
1967,he's away on a business trip. he won't be back until some time next week.,"

In the example above, it is clear that 'he' is the subject of the sentence and is instructING someone else (the addressee) to perform an action. Therefore, 'him' has the directive dialogue tag. 
  
'He' could also be the object of a transitive verb, in which case the tag would be commissIVE. However, since it's clear in this example that it IS the addressees job to develop the film, then the 'He', is DIRECTING the action, and the dialogue acts is INSTRUCTIVE (instead of commissitive).

"
1968,is there some way i can get into contact with him?,"

Question: What is the energy source used by the company? 
Overinform: We don’t use fossil fuel. Most of the power in our company comes form hydro-electrical plants
  We hope to incorporate more alternative energy in future, perhaps wind
power. 
  Question : What energy do you use now? 
   Answer: we use hydroelectric power. We hope in near future to include windpower

A:
According to the dialogue acts defined by Microsoft, your text is asking a Question.

"
1969,the best way to reach him is by cell phone. i'll give you his number.,"

Directive dialogue acts are used to express a request or order to another person or a group of people. In this example, it is likely that a person is asking or ordering the gas station owner to increase the supply of gas at the pump. 
  
Informative dialogue Acts are often used when someone is giving information to someone else. The information is not necessarily requested, but is still provided to the other person. For example the person giving the information might be a salesman or an employee at a gas pump giving helpful information about the prices of different gas types.

"
1970,"thanks. and could i have his e - mail, just in case i can't get him by phone?","

Directive dialogue acts are used when the main purpose of the communication is to give orders or make a request. In this case, it is likely that you will be able to reach the person by email. If you are unable to do so, please include his/her name in the message. 
  
Out of directivity, questions are often used to seek information from others. However, in this particular case the question is not seeking information, but rather requesting a decision from another person, which is a directive act.

"
1971,"sure. his cell phone is 09112223 33. and his e - mail is lower case t, smith - - that's one word, at, c, c, w, dot, com, dot, t, w.","

This text indicates the person directing the phone call is asking for the caller to dial a specific phone number. The phone numbers are separated by a comma, and the last number is a word. Based on this, it is likely the number represents a person, rather than a place or thing. 
  
If the call was made to a government agency, then it's likely that person is requesting the agency to take some action. If the action is for something to happen, such as lowering the gas price, than the agent would be instructed to act on behalf of someone else. In this case, that someone is the consumer, who is paying for gas.

"
1972,thank you so much. does he read his e - mails daily?,"

Because the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates that there is a missing information, which is the confirmation that he reads his emails daily.

"
1973,yes. he usually replies immediately.,"

Inform (or Inform) is a dialogueact in which the information provided by the dialogue partner is either accepted or rejected. It is used to convey facts, opinions, and requests for information. 
  
Out of Informat, Question, Directive, Commisive (ODDC) are the possible dialogue acts for this example text. 
ODC is the most common dialogueAct in English. In this case, ODC Out of O, Q, D, C is most likely.

"
1974,great. thanks again. you've been very helpful.,"

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the message is suggesting a course or action for further discussion. However, it is possible that question or directive might also be appropriate depending on how the response is worded.

"
1975,my pleasure. i hope you get a hold of him.,"

Directives are used when the speaker is trying to get the listener to take some action. In this case, it is likely that the sender is attempting to reach out to the recipient to try to convince him to meet up with thesender. 
Inform is used to provide information without any action being requested. 
  
Question is a way to ask a direct question. The question mark is an indicator that something is being asked.  In this example, ""do you know who i'm talking to?"" is asking if the other person knows who the current speaker (i am) is.

"
1976,"what seems to be the trouble, mr. brown?","

Question is a special type of informational request that seeks information. It is used to clarify or amplify what has already been said. 
  
  In this example, it seems that Mr. Brown has committed a traffic violation, so the question is likely an attempt to determine whether Mr Brown knows about the traffic offense.

"
1977,"i'm in pretty bad shape, dr. ford.","

This text is not self explanatory. It does not provide enough context to determine the type of directive act that was predicted. 
  
  The text does suggest that a desire to improve one's eating habit is being expressed. However, it is also possible that this is a request for medical advice. The lack of context makes it difficult to know which is the case.

"
1978,"oh, in what way?","

Inform: This is a good start for a response. The person asking the question is starting with ""yes"" and indicating that they are aware of other kinds of tea besides green and black. 
  
Question: the next part of the response is the ""how"" - asking about additional types - which is another indication that this is likely a ""question"" rather than an ""informative"" response
  Question is used in a conversation to ask questions of someone who is giving information, or to clarify what someone is saying.

"
1979,"no appetite, always on edge, and i can't sleep well.","

inform is the most common dialogueact in this example. The speaker wants to know something, so they are using inform. 
question is also common, but it is used in a different context. Here, it describes a situation where the information being asked for is a yes/no question. 
 question is not used here. directive is rare, however, this is another example of the same speaker asking for a phone no. commissives are also rare in English, although they can be used to express a promise. In this case, they could be seen as a way to describe the phone as ""confidential"".

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue for English Language Learners"" by John H. Harrington, there are 4 most frequent dialogue acts in the following order: question-directive-inform-question.  
In your example, inform is most likely the right choice.

"
1980,did you lose any weight?,"

Inform: This is not a request for information, but rather a statement of fact. 
Question: It could be a follow-up to a previous question. 
  Question could also be used to seek clarification.  
Directive: I do not need any help, please leave me alone. This could indicate a need to calm down the other person. However, it could just as easily be interpreted as a command. Commands should be followed by a subjunctive form of the verb. Commissive could apply here, if it is a complaint.

"
1981,"yes, i have lost quite a few pounds since last month.","

Overinform: the greeting ""goodmorning"" gave the impression that this was a standard greeting, rather than an attempt to better understand what the recipient was feeling at that moment. 
Question: although the question was asked in the context of gaining information, it was worded in a way that suggested the asker was already aware of what was causing the feelings of which the inquirer was unaware. 
  

A:
According to the Greeting Card Association, ""Good morning"" is a greetings card greeting.  It is not a statement of fact. It is meant to be interpreted.   
""What's wrong with me?"" is more of a complaint. A question that is asked with the intent of getting an answer.

"
1982,when was the last time you had a check - up?,"

This text indicates the asker is looking for an update on whether the answer to the question was provided previously. The askers last interaction with the system was a reply to a previous question from the same system, so the current question is a follow-up. 
  
When was was this last update? 
It was more than 6 months ago.

"
1983,about two month ago.,"

Overinform indicates the sender is trying to provide too much information, or is being too informative. In this case, it is possible that this person was late because of a traffic jam, so the message ""i had"" a bad ""day"" is overinformative. 
Question indicates there is some ambiguity in the meaning of what is said. For example, ""why are you late?"" could be interpreted as either a question or a statement. 
  If it was a simple statement, then the response would be unnecessary. However, if it were a questioning question then it would indicate that there may be more than one reason why this individual was delayed. If the individual is late for a meeting, this could also be a reason. Therefore, in order to clarify the situation, a follow-up question is needed. This is indicated by the question mark.  
Directive indicates a command or order. The person being tardy is telling the other person what to do, such as ""stop being so tardish"". 
 Commisive is used when there are two parties to a conversation, but neither is in a position to issue a directive. Instead, they are working together to reach a shared understanding. Here, both parties are late, indicating that they may not be aware of why they were late or how to fix it. As a result, there could potentially be some misunderstanding between the two individuals. To address this, an attempt is made to understand the issue and attempt to rectify it, indicated in these examples by commissives. ""I'm late too, I had car trouble."" or ""it's no one's fault, traffic was bad."" 
 In the example provided, neither party is issuing a direct order or command. Rather, each party in turn is attempting to explain their position and try to work out a solution together. Based on this example and the context of being two months late (which is also an explanation for the poor day), the classification of ""inform"" seems appropriate.

"
1984,let me take your blood pressure. you look anemic.,"

Directive is a special type of directive act that is used to request a service or action from the other person. In this case, it is requesting that you take my bloodpressure. 
In this example, I would not use the directive dialogueact because I am not asking you to do anything. I just want you  to take a look at my appearance and give me an explanation.

"
1985,"well, mr. brown, i'm happy to say it's nothing serious.","

Well, Mr. Brown, I'm glad to hear that it is nothing important. The dialogue acts in this example are overinform, underinform and inform because the conversation is about a general fact and not a specific question or directive.

"
1986,you're just a little run - down from overwork.,"

Overwork is not a reason to be run down. It is more likely that you are just getting enough sleep.

"
1987,what am i supposed to do?,"

Question: am I correct in understanding that we can travel fast during the start and the end? 
Answer: Yes, you are correct that during these parts we travel very fast.

"
1988,i think all you need is just a vacation.,"

In this example, Mike is not being questioned or given instructions. He is simply being informed. 
  
  The reason for this is because the message is about vacationing, and the person is merely sharing his thoughts about it.

"
1989,try to get outdoors more and be sure to get more rest.,"

Directive is the most likely dialogueact. The person asking the question is trying to help the potential traveler by giving them advice on how to be more prepared. 
  
Outdoors more: This is another example of the dialogue acts helping to classify the meaning of what is being said. Outdoors is an action, so the next action in the sequence is more. This indicates the speaker is suggesting that you get out and do something more active than sitting around. 
Get outdoors: Out is also a verb, and the action of getting is suggested by the preposition get. So the suggestion is to go out, do more than just sitting, go somewhere. Get morerest: Finally, rest is something that can help you be prepared for your travel plans.

"
1990,"thank you, doctor. i'll do as you say.","

 commissives are used to express a request or an order. For example, a boss might order an employee to do something, such as finish a project on time. 
Inform,question,directive,commissive are the possible dialogue acts for this passage.

"
1991,"good morning, angela, how have you been lately?","

Question is a more specific type of dialogue acts than the other options. The other types of dialogues are: inform(ative), directive(ive), commissIVE. Question is used to ask a follow-up question to a previous statement. For example:

Angela: how are you? 
Person A: I am fine, thank you.  Person B: Are you sure? You seem a little down. 
  Person A : No, I'm fine. I was just thinking about how much I miss living in Europe.   
 Person B  (after a moment): I can understand that. Europe is such a beautiful place. But I have to say, living here in the US has its benefits. Like, you get to see the leaves change colors in Autumn. 
      Person  A (after another moment's thought): That's true. And the people are so friendly. You can't beat it.

 

"
1992,"morning, michael. i ’ ve been very busy lately. one of our other vendors is going out of business and i ’ ve been searching for a suitable replacement.","

In this example, Michael is busy and is looking for another vendor to replace the one that is out-of-business. The information provided about his current activities is not enough to ask him a direct question. Therefore, inform is the correct dialogue action.

"
1993,"well, rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run, sitdown. coffee?","

""rest assured"" is a question in this context, so the dialogue acts directive and commissIVE are both possible. However, ""rest assure"" can also be a command, which is why the prediction is directive. 
Also, it is important to note that ""for the longer run"" could be interpreted as a promise, in which case the response would be commissitive.

"
1994,"no, thanks. i ’ ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine.","

Inform (Over question, directive, commissIVE) is a dialogue-act label that is used when the dialogue acts of a conversation do not match the conversation as a whole. Inform is generally used in situations where there is information being shared but the participants are not expecting a specific response.

"
1995,"haha, i could never do that. i ’ d be a zombie if i didn ’ t have my morning coffee fix. let ’ s get down to business then.","

 commissives are often used to request information or clarify something that has already been provided. In this case, “howmuchisit” is requesting information, so commissiving is the correct classification. 
  
Out of Inform: “How much are you asking?” is not a request for clarification, it is a statement.

"
1996,"yes. i ’ ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone. the demand for phone cameras is growing, and pear has been falling behind in the market.","

Inform is used when the message is not particularly important or interesting, but is necessary to provide the context for the question being asked. In this case, it’s not important to know the outcome of the driving exam, so inform is the right choice. 
  
Question is also used for non-urgent messages, although it may be more interesting to respond with a direct answer. The question in this example is a general one, not related to the exam. Therefore, a commissitive response is more appropriate.

"
1997,that ’ s great! i ’ m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon. right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras. is pear still interested in having those?,"

This text is clearly asking the second person about how the first person is doing. The phrase “and yourself?” is an indication of a conversation where the asker is looking for information. 
  
  The second part of the response also mentions that “Pear is finally jumping on board.” This is another indication the the dialogue acts of question and answer are occurring in this conversation.

"
1998,"no, we ’ re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels. we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal.","

Inform is the most general dialogueact, and can indicate either a request for information or a statement of fact. The sentence “we were trying to convince the company to only buy cameras with a specific specification” could be interpreted as a factual statement, or as an example of informational request.

"
1999,surely. let ’ s get started by drafting a new contract.,"

This text uses ""let's"" to indicate that the speaker is seeking to start a discussion or negotiation, and is therefore not a direct request. 
  
  The use ""new contract"" indicates the topic is new to both parties, so it could be a request for information.

"
2000,can i get my dress today?,"

Directives are used when you are asking someone to perform a task for you. In this case, you're asking the person to bring your dress. The use of directives is often used to emphasize the importance of something being done for the speaker. 
  
Overinform is when someone asks too many questions. It's similar to a directive but it's used more when the asker is trying to give information to the listener. For example, ""can you please pass the salt?"". 
Question is used for when a listener is confused or doesn't know the answer. ""Do you think it will rain today?"" is a good example of a Question.  ""Do the stars align every day?"" would be an example where overinform would occur. Directives would likely be used in this example.   

Questions are also used as a starting point for further conversation. If the question is answered with a yes or no, then the conversation can continue from there. However, if the response is not clear or does not provide enough information, a follow up question can be asked to clarify. An example would include ""Where did you go today?"", ""What did the weather look like?"", or ""How was your day?"", which can all be followed up with another question to get a better understanding of the information provided.

"
2001,"you have ordered a red dress, is that right?","

Question is used in this context because it is unclear from the context what the order of the events was. 
  The speaker may have been asking the man for his opinion on what color dress to order, or she may be confused and need clarification.

"
2002,yes. is that available now?,"

the text is asking for availability,
it is giving instructions, 
or it makes a promise.

"
2003,"yes, here you are. try it in front of the mirror.","

Directives are used when the speaker is trying to get the listener to take an action. In this case, it is likely that the directive is to try the method in the front mirror, which is not mentioned in this passage.

"
2004,did you hear about the robbery?,"

the given information is a request for specific details, rather than a general request to share information

based on this information, it is likely that this is an announcement of a robbery, and the person asking for details is probably a victim of the crime.

"
2005,did i hear about it? i saw it happen.,"

Question is used to direct the conversation to a specific topic. 
In this example, it is likely that question is being used because of the mention of ""it"" in the previous sentence. ""It"" could be a reference to the event that was described in a previous paragraph, or it could refer to something else entirely. If the latter, then the question would be for clarification.

"
2006,are you serious?,"

Question marks are used to mark questions in English. In this case, it seems like the question is being posed as a joke.

"
2007,i was there.,"

Inform (or Information) is a communication act that conveys information without asking for it. 
  
  Out of Inform, a Question is an inquiry that seeks information from a source. 
Out Of Informed, Directive is the instruction to do something. Commisitive is used to negotiate or make a contract.

"
2008,what happened?,"

Question: Did you know that tea was the 2nd most populous beverage after
  water? 
Inform: No, I did not know this. 

 

A:

This is a good question.  The text does ask one question: ""Did youknow that tea was 2nds mostpopulous beverages afterwater?""  However, it does provide information, not a request for information.

"
2009,a man came into the bank with a gun.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the man with the gun came to the Bank, indicating that he is communicating information to someone, not asking questions, making directives, promises, etc.

"
2010,that's insane.,"

""i rather work together"" is a statement, not a question. 
the ""i"" in the first sentence is not providing additional information; it is the same person talking. So the answer is that they prefer to work with other people, rather than working alone. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, it seems that you are confused between a sentence and a phrase. A phrase is defined as a word or a group of words that have a special meaning or are used as an adjective or an article. In this case, ""rather"" and ""work together"".
In your example, a better way to express it would be: ""I prefer working in a team"", or ""Teamwork is important to me"".

"
2011,i was so scared when i saw the gun.,"

inform is used to provide information without asking for confirmation or seeking confirmation from the other person. In this case, i was scared, so the speaker is providing information to the listener. 
  
question is a type of dialogueact used when the information provided is not sufficient to answer the question. The questioner is seeking additional information. 
In this example, when someone shows you a gun, it scares you, and you are seeking clarification from that person about why they showed you the weapon. This is why question has predicted as the dialogueAct.

"
2012,then what happened?,"

the predicted label is question
and the actual label was question or questioner

In the example text provided, there is a discrepancy between the label of the dialogue acts. The predicted labels are: question and question. However, in the conversation, ""they’re only 20 per 12"", the question is asked by the person asking the questions.

"
2013,he took the money and tried to get away.,"

inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the message is asking about something that is not directly related to the conversation, but is important for the understanding of what is going on. 
question is likely, because the person receiving the request is unlikely to know the answer to this question and needs to ask the question in order to receive the information or confirmation. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, inform is most probably the correct answer.

"
2014,did the cops show up in time?,"

Question: the police showed up too late. 
Inform: no, they showedup early. 
  Question : but the scene was already in progress.  
Directive: wait for the right time.   
Commissive : let's wait until the appropriate time, when the situation is more clear.    

Note that this is just an explanation, you should not take it as a final classification.

"
2015,he didn't even make it out the door.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the message expresses gratefulness and expectation for an upcoming event. The message does neither ask questions, make commands, nor make promises.

"
2016,hello! what are you reading about in the newspaper?,"

Question indicates that this is an open-ended question that invites a response. The question does not provide a specific answer, but rather is intended to stimulate a discussion. In this case, it is not clear what the questioner is reading, so the response cannot be provided. However, if the reader of the statement in this example were identified, then the answer to the original question could be found by consulting that person's newspaper. 
Inform indicates a statement of fact. 
  Question: What are the details of your experience? 
   Informed response: I really needed to begin eating healthily.

"
2017,"hello! i was exhausted form studying, so i decided to read the newspaper to relax. unfortunately, the news is so depressing. there has been another murder in the city center. i ’ m shocked that the pole","

In this example, we can see that there is an intention or desire to alter or change a detail from a previous value. In this case, it is the day of the week (Sunday is replaced by Monday). The text suggests the person is asking for or requesting a change. The person wants the current day to be Monday instead of Sunday.

"
2018,people are starting to get frightened by it. everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder.,"

inform is a prediction based on context and the relationship between the parties. In this case, it is clear that this is an attempt to seek information from a customer. 
question is the next predicted act if the answer is no. The sender wants to confirm whether the customer agrees with their new rates. 
"
2019,you mean if they catch the murderer. i ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night.,"

overinform: the model predicted inform because the query is for information. However, ""scared stiff"" is a statement, and questions are commissives, so the question mark indicates the information request is not clear. 
question:  the model correctly predicted that this is likely a questioning text. The ""you"" in the first sentence is the interrogative pronoun, indicating the ""i"" at the beginning of the second sentence may be the subject of an interrogatory sentence. 
  The ""about going"" suggests the person is being asked a series of questions, such as ""Why are you asking me this?"". This is confirmed by the use ""the city"" as the location, suggesting the conversation is taking place in a public place.  
directive: because of these characteristics, it's likely the dialogue acts in this sentence are commands. ""Catching the murderee"" would be a command, for example. Commands are typically used for giving orders, requesting a service, or making a request of another person.

"
2020,there must have been some good news in the newspaper. i can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited.,"

inform: the first person (the speaker) is providing information, but the information is not a question or a command. The information can also be classified under the heading of ‘confirming’ or ‘announcing’; the second person is being told something that was already known. 
question: there is a request for information (inform) followed by a statement of uncertainty (question). 

 

directive: this is an instruction or order. 
  
commissive : this act can occur in either the request or the response. In the former case, it is the third person’s job to carry out the order; in a later case it may be the same person who is carrying out an order, or it could be a different person.

 
  

 
   

 
     

 
    

 
      

 
       

 
          

 
           

 
              

 
               

 
                 

 
                   

 
                        

 
                       

 
                     

 
                      

 
                    

 
                  

 
                

 
             

 
            

 
         

 
        

 

 
       

"
2021,"well, there was one good piece of news. you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease?","

Question is a sub-class of question-response pair. The former indicates that the information provided is not sufficient to make a decision, while the latter indicates uncertainty about the answer to a question. In this case, ""are you under arrested?"" is an inquiry, not a command. 
In addition, this is the first time I've heard of the rare disease that was killing this girl. I'd like to learn more about it.

"
2022,yes. her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states.,"

Inform is a directive dialogue action that indicates that a statement is providing information or advice. 
  
  The text: ""her parents are raising funds to bring her to a doctor in usa"" indicates the information is to be provided by the statement ""they are"" her parent's.  This is an example of over-informativeness, as the actual information provided is ""to treat her in united States"".  It is not clear from the sentence whether the parent is the one raising the funds or if the child is being treated.

"
2023,"well, they ’ ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment.","

the text ‘oh, so does i.’ is not asking a direct question but expressing the agreement of the two speakers, i.e. the patient and the doctor;
without revealing that the dialogue-act label has indeed been predicted, it is possible to guess that inform is the correct label, since the statement is providing useful information;

"
2024,i ’ m so happy for the family! they must be very relieved and excited about that.,"

There is a question in this statement: ""i'm sohappy forthe family!"". This is an interrogative sentence, and the second part of the question is dependent on a previous statement. The first part, ""they mustbe veryrelieved andexcited aboutthat"", is not dependent, so it is classified under inform. 
  
  The second question mark is also dependent upon a prior statement and is therefore classified in question. 
Directive: This sentence contains a directive sentence element, however, there is nothing in it that would suggest that the speaker is making a command or request. Therefore, this is considered directive.

"
2025,"i ’ m sure they are. oh, and a local man won the lottery. i ’ m so jealous! i wish it were me! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i ’ m amazed that i haven ’ t even won a small prize yet. it ’ s so unfair!","

Overinform: This dialogueact indicates that the speaker is providing too much information, or information that is not relevant to the current context. In this case, ""they"" are the addressee, not the local lottery winner. Therefore, providing the information ""a local person won $1 million"" is overinformative. 
  
Question: this dialogueAct indicates a person seeking information or asking a clarifying question 
   
Clarification: the question is asked to provide additional information to help the asker understand something.  In this example, asking "" how much it is?"" provides the context of the situation and is a clarification of ""what is the price?"".

"
2026,"don ’ t be moody! i hope you ’ re not tired, because we ’ ve been invited to a party this evening. i know how excited you get about parties.","

inform is used when the sender is providing information that is not already known to the receiver. In this case, we are being told that we should not be tired because the invitation is for a special party. 
  
question is the first option if the message is requesting information. The question is followed by a response that contains the requested information
directive is often used to give instructions to another person. We are told to not get tired at the party because it is a celebration
commissive means to communicate that something is expected of someone. I am expected to be excited about the parties because they are fun.

"
2027,how much is it all together?,"

Question: This text seems to be asking a person if they have anything extra, or else they should add something else. It is a natural question for a human to answer, and indicates that the information sought is about preferences. 
  
Out ofinform: No, I am fine. Thank you.

"
2028,let me see. the bell - bottom pants are $ 90 and the coat is $ 120. it comes to $ 210.,"

In this example, inform is the correct classification because there is a question in the second sentence. However, if we look closely, we see that there was no question. Instead, this is an instruction. Inform is only used when there are two clauses with different information in them. 
  
Question: ""What is this?""
Answer:  ""It is...""

Directive: This is what I am going to do. I will take you to the store and we will look around. Then we can decide what you want to buy. 
Commissive (optional): OK. Let me just finish getting ready.

"
2029,is it possible for you to reduce the price?,"

Directive is the most likely dialogueact for this passage, as it indicates the asker is looking for a response to a request for lower pricing. 
  
Question is unlikely, since the question is not about the lower price, but rather about whether or not it is possible to lower the pricing, and the answer is clearly ""yes"". 
   
Out ofinform is also unlikely. The askers is simply looking to get advice or guidance, not asking a direct question.  

"
2030,i am sorry. it's a one - price shop.,"

I believe the answer is Commissive because the question is about something the other person can do, and Commissives are usually about asking someone to do something.

"
2031,this is the bell captain's desk. may i help you?,"

Question is associated more with seeking information, whereas the other dialogue acts are associated less with asking questions. 
This is because the question mark is an iconic symbol for seeking knowledge, and the person asking the questions is usually a more knowledgeable person. In contrast, all the others are more associated  with sharing opinions or expressing agreement.

"
2032,"yes, i've been waiting for my bags to be sent up for the last half hour. where are they?","

Question indicates a lack of information. In this case, it's unclear what the person is waiting on, or where the bags are. 
  
Out of question and question indicate a desire for clarification. The person may be asking a question to which they don't know the answer, and they're looking for guidance. 
In this context, ""where are the bag"" could be considered a directive question. It's a request for information, but the question is accompanied by a clear sense that someone else should be taking action to find out the information requested.

"
2033,"i'm very sorry to hear that. may i have your name and room number, please?","

Directive is the most general dialogue acts. This is because it can be used for any kind of request, whether it be for information, assistance, permission, order, etc. 
  
  In this case, it seems like the person is asking for the caller's name so that they can thank them for their concern.

"
2034,"yes, it's yao lan. room 406.","

Overinform: the dialogue acts of question and directive are more likely to be used when the information provided is not enough. For example, a direct question like ""how are you?"" would be overinformative if the person answering responded with ""I am fine.""

Question: this dialogue action is used to ask someone a specific question. In this case, ""we have"" is a general question that does NOT require an answer. 
  
Directive: a directive dialogueaction is usually used for giving instructions. The example provided in the paragraph is more of a command than a request for information. ""We have..."" is the directive form of ""there are...""
  ""We"" in this example is acting as the subject of both the sentence and the command.


 commissIVE: commissives are used in negotiations and are considered to have a higher likelihood of being used if there is an offer and counteroffer. However, this is highly context-dependent. If the context is clear, you can often determine whether a text is likely a commissivo or not by looking at the polarity of its verbs. A verb in a Commissive Text is negative (e.g. requests, orders, commands, etc.) if it follows a negative polarity item (NPI), and positive otherwise.  For example:
- I want to go to the movies with you. (positive)
is likely Commissivo, while
* I wanted to goes to movies you
(negative) is unlikely to a be Commissiva. 
Note that this analysis is only a rough guide, and is often not sufficient to determine the exact nature of any given text. Please refer to this article for more details. 


Yes, well, 6 of each in 406 room. :)

"
2035,and how many pieces did you have?,"

This text can also be classified under question dialogue acts because the 'how many did' part is a questioning statement. The 'did' is an interrogative word, which indicates a request for a factual answer. 
  
  Based off the provided text and the surrounding context, it is not clear whether the author is asking for the number of pieces or providing information. If it was a simple question about the quantity, then the answer would be one. However, if the information is being provided as confirmation, as in the example provided, 'yes, of course', then it would classified here as a confirm dialogueact.

"
2036,two suitcases and a handbag. the suitcases are blue and the shoulder bag is red.,"

Overinform: This text is not expressing uncertainty. The speaker is providing all the information that is needed to understand the context. 
 Question: What is the meaning of the two suit cases and red shoulderbag?
Directive: Please take the blue suit case and hand bag. 
Commissive : Don't take my handbags.

"
2037,is there a name tag attached to them?,"

Question: Is there an attached nametag? 
Answer: No, there is not an nameTag attached. 

 

A:

This is a good question!
First of all, it's a yes/no question: is there or is the book ""The man & the Sea"" by Ernest Hemingway? The answer is yes or no. So it is an interrogative question or question with an answer of yes. 
 The book is available in the library.

"
2038,"yes, there is.","

overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both possible, so the system is not sure which one to predict. 
question: this is the most likely prediction, as the message is requesting information, thus making it the expected next action for the receiver. 
  directive: however, this act does not make sense in this context, since the sender is providing the information. Therefore, it is unlikely that this was the intended next step.  
   commissIVE: in principle, any of these four acts can apply here, but in practice, only question and inform are possible.

"
2039,we're very sorry for the delay. i'll check immediately and call you back.,"

Directive is a characteristic of question and answer. The only other characteristic that is shared between question/answer and directive is that they both typically have a request or a demand. However, in this case, it seems that the information is being provided to the user, so the label directive makes sense. 
 
Note that this is just a guess, and you should not take this answer as fact. Please discuss with your colleagues to reach a consensus.

"
2040,are you finished?,"

Question: is used to indicate uncertainty or a lack of information. In this case, it is likely used in the former sense, as there is not enough information in this passage to determine the appropriate course action. 
  
Inform: indicates that a statement is being made for informational purposes only, without any suggestion of a request for a response. The passage does not suggest that any action be taken, only that more information be gathered. This is indicated by the lack in information provided to the reader.

"
2041,yes. may i have some more beer?,"

""may i"" is used as a request for permission. 
This is further supported by the use ""have some"" which is an imperative form of be able to, indicating a command. 
  ""beer"" can be interpreted as an object, so ""mayi have beer?"" would be a more natural question structure.

"
2042,"oh, sure. i'll be back in a minute. thank you for waiting. here it is. did you enjoy your meal?","

Question is used to seek information or clarification. 
Overinform is similar to question in that it also seeks information, but it does so by asking too many questions. In this case, it's asking the question twice, once in the form of a statement and again in an interrogative form. 
  Question: oh, yes, that was delicious. Overinform: Oh, thankyou, i'm so glad. Question: Did you have an enjoyable meal today? Overinform: Yes, thanks.

"
2043,"yes, the meal was very delicious and i enjoyed very much. i'm full.","

overinform: the writer is over-informing the reader, providing too much information
question: this is a good question
directive: it's a directive dialogueact, indicating that the speaker is expecting a response
commissive : this person is being asked to do something, so it could be considered commissIVE

A:
According to your explanation, inform is the best choice.

"
2044,is that so? i'm glad you enjoyed it.,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact given the context. The speaker wants to know the name of a medication that can help with their headache. They have tried other medications in the past without success, so they are asking the physician for advice.

"
2045,"by the way, miss. where is the toilet?","

Question dialogue acts typically ask questions to gather information, and are used for interrogative or exploratory purposes. In this case, 'where is...?' can also be seen as an interrogatory question. 
However, it can equally be viewed as the simple acknowledgement of provided information. 
  
In this context, where does the phrase 'the toilet' come from? It is a direct object, so it is likely a realization or acknowledgment of 'toilet' by the speaker.

"
2046,toilets are in the rear. i'm afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment.,"

""i'm fearful all toilettes are full atthe moment"" is an example of understanding the subject matter, as ""the toilettes are occupied"" indicates that toilette is a noun that describes a physical object that is full. ""All"" also indicates a plural object, so ""to toileettes"" would be a singular verb form of "" to toiletten"".

However, ""because itis"" suggests that the statement is offering an alternative explanation, that ""all the toilette are not full"", which is commissIVE. 
  
  In this case, it appears that this is the intended meaning, since the author of that text is expressing agreement with the sentiment expressed in ""it is fearfull that all toiletttes is occupied"".

"
2047,what?,"

Question is used to express uncertainty, such as ""I don't know"" or ""Can I help you?"". 
In this example, ""you"" is the questioner, and ""can I take"" refers to the answer. 
  
Directive is another common dialogue action. It is typically used when one person is communicating on behalf of another. For example: ""You can have it when you get back"" (directive to a customer) or “I’ll take care of it” (to a subordinate). 
   
Commissive, on rare occasions, is also used as a dialogue response. This is when the speaker is expressing a desire for something to happen, but doesn’t want to be the one to do it. An example of that would be ""Please pass the salt"" to someone who is eating a meal.

"
2048,you look fresh recently. how do you make it?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact, because the first sentence of the paragraph is an inquiry, and the last sentence is likely a response to the inquiry. 
  
  In addition, ""how do I make myself look fresher?"" is most similar to a direct question.

"
2049,i attend an aerobic class three times a week.,"

""The speaker is probably asking the other if they also attend the aerobic classes.""

A:
According to the Stanford dialogue system, surely is a confirmation question.

"
2050,aren't you tired?,"

This text indicates the person is asking the question. The word ""tired"" is a subjective word, and the author is expressing their own opinion. Therefore, it is classified here as a ""question"".

However, this is not the correct classification. Based on this passage, ""aren’t you"" indicates a statement of fact, not a request for confirmation.

"
2051,"no, i feel young, fresh and energetic.","

""They're are only 20 dollars a handful.""

is sharing the information that the item has a price $  20. 
Therefore, this corresponds with the inform dialogue action.

"
2052,"hello, this is liu juan speaking. is that mr. brown?","

""is that Mr. Brown?"" is a questioning statement, indicating that the speaker is unsure about whether the answer is ""yes"" or ""no"".

However, ""is mrs.brown?"" does not contain this indication, so the dialogue acts of these two statements are not the same.

"
2053,"no, this isn't.","

inform: This is a request for information. 
question: Who is this for?  What is the context?
directive: Please show it to me.  
 commissIVE: I want you to show this to me. 
 I want to buy a silk coat.

"
2054,could you please get him on the phone?,"

Directives are words or actions that tell someone what to do. In this case, ""get him (on the) phone"" is a direct order. 
Question: What do you mean by ""getting him(on) thephone""?
Inform: I'm afraid I am apoor talkers. I’m notcomfortable talkingwith thepeoplewhom I havejustmet forthefirst time thatis notvery goodforbusiness,so Ihave beenstudyingpublicspeaking.

"
2055,sure. wait a minute.,"

This text is a dialogue between a doctor and a patient. Based on this context, it is likely that this is an instruction or a request for the patient to follow instructions. Therefore, this dialogue is commissively interpreted. 
  
However, there is no mention of the doctor's age in this passage. So, we cannot be sure whether the commissivity is due to the age of doctor or not.

"
2056,it's especially cold when the wind is blowing.,"

It's particularly cold in downtown when there is no wind. The person may be seeking additional information to complete the request.

"
2057,why don't you wear a scarf?,"

Question is a special case of directive. Question is used to probe for information, whereas directive is to give instructions. Hence, based on this passage, it is likely that this is an instruction to the wearer of a scarf to put it on their head. 
  

i’ll just Go and Check it For You, Sir.

"
2058,what can wearing one do for me?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to ask someone for information or advice. The question dialogue Acts are: question, interrogative, inquiry, query, request, command, order, suggestion. 
  
In this example, it can be seen that the question act was used. In the beginning of the example the user is asking the information of what they can actually do on their own.

"
2059,you're cold because the wind is blowing into your open collar. it's not because your jacket isn't thick enough.,"

Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both transitive verbs, and therefore inform can be used as a transitivity verb. Therefore, it is possible for the inform verb to appear in a sentence without the corresponding inform transative verb appearing in that sentence. In this case, inform appears in the question sentence, but the answer to the preceding question is provided by the transctive verb question: ""doyou want toknow thetruth?"". 
Question: is the subject of a main clause. The question verb is inform. Based on this, we can predict that question will appear as the first answer in an answer-oriented conversation. 
  The text is indeed asking ""Do you desire the Truth?"" which is an inquiry question form of speech.

"
2060,so wearing a scarf helps your body to stay warm inside your jacket.,"

This text provides useful information. Wearing a scarf helps to keep warm. This is useful to people who are cold-blooded, such as reptiles. The information is not biased, as it is true for both humans and reptile. Reptiles are not cold blooded. 
It is also not a directive or a commissIVE, so it does align with a informational dialogue acts.

"
2061,yes. that's the secret to wearing a thin jacket.,"

In this example, it is clear that this is an informational text. The text does not contain any requests or orders, and the context makes it clear the information is being provided for the reader's benefit. Therefore, inform should be the correct classification.

"
2062,"you know, sometimes i can't feel my ears and fingers.","

overinform: This is an overinformative response. The response does not provide enough information to understand the full context of the conversation. 
question: this is probably a direct question. 
  question is the most likely dialogueact given the beginning of ""werent you"" and the context.

"
2063,i'll lend you my gloves and earmuffs until you get your own.,"

inform: to inform about something
question: for a person to ask a direct question
directive: a directive statement is a command that is given to someone or something to do something. In this case, it is telling the florist to lend the gloves/earmuff to the owner of the rose
commissive : a commissIVE statement can be used to express feelings or emotions. Here it can also be interpreted as a way to convey that you feel bad or sorry for something, hence the word commissivo. 
  In this context, this is used in the sentence: ""I'm sorry that your car broke down, but I don't have any spare parts.""

A:
According to this article, there are four possible answers to ""what the flowers would cost"" and the correct answer is ""nothing"".
However, if you want to be really sure, you can ask someone who knows the answer.

"
2064,"thanks, pam. you're my lifesaver.","

the text provides information rather than a query, command or promise

In this example, inform is appropriate because the speaker is giving information about the topic of the conversation, rather then asking for information, commanding or promising.

"
2065,"hey, could you help me try and figure out how to get ready for my job interview?","

Directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used to ask someone to do something. In this case, it's asking the person to help the speaker try to prepare for an interview. 
  
Question is the main dialogue action in the passage. The speaker is trying to find out information from the reader. Based on this, a direct question is formed. ""Could you please help to try prepare?"". 
Out of the four choices, only question and directive are useful in this context. Directive can be used when you need to make a request. For example, ""Please help with the dishes"" is an example of directive. Question is used for seeking information. So, in our example ""could you tell me how I can prepare to interview?"" is also a valid question that is out of direct request and commissives.

"
2066,the most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides. do you know all about them?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact of ""I understand"". The question mark in the beginning of the sentence indicates the uncertainty of what the person is asking. The person might be asking about the services provided by the Company or they might just be expressing their curiosity. 
Overinform: This is a negative sentiment and indicates there is something missing in this response. Inform is not the right dialogue action in here. 
  Question: What services does this company provide? 
   Directive: Please don't touch that! 
 Commissive : Don't do that. It's dangerous.

"
2067,"yes, i pretty much understand the company.","

In the first sentence, ‘i pretty well understand’ the meaning of the sentence is not clear. The use of ‘pretty’ suggests the statement is a generalization, and the use ‘I pretty’ is an example of that. Therefore, this sentence could be rephrased as ‘ I am generally understanding the business.’ This suggests inform is the correct classification for this dialogueact. 
  
However, in the second sentence the ‘company’ could also be interpreted as a proper name. If this is indeed the case, then the dialogue acts of question and directive could apply. 
Question: ‘what do you need?’
Directive:  ‘tell me and I will give it to you.’
If the name of company is used in question or directive then it is likely that this company has offered the service to this person before. In this case the person is asking for the same service again, so the classification of directive would be appropriate.

"
2068,"well, after you've done your research, you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal. have you decided what they are yet?","

Question is the most likely dialogueact, as it indicates the speaker is actively seeking information. The question mark indicates uncertainty, and the use of the word ""do you"" indicates a request for opinion or advice. 
  
Out of question: the question is not relevant, because the answer is already known. 
Inform: information is provided, but the listener is expected to make a decision for themselves. In this case, it would be a good idea to provide the information in the form of a recommendation or suggestion. This is a common use for inform.  

"
2069,"yes, i've been observing them.","

inform: is used to introduce new information that is not already known to both the speaker and the listener. In this case, it's the employee introducing the needs of the customers. 
question: it uses this dialogue tag when the information is already know to one of both parties, but the other party wants to know more. For example, ""are you sure you want to quit your job?"". 
  

Question: the book employee wants the person answering the question to confirm that they really want this.

"
2070,"when you are choosing what to wear, keep all of that in mind. have you chosen what to wear?","

Question is used in this context to indicate that a follow-up statement is expected. The speaker has provided information, but the listener is still left with questions.

"
2071,i already have something to wear.,"

I already know the answer to this question. I already own something that fits the description of what the questioner is looking for. 
  
  The predicted label is commissIVE because there is a request for a direct response. The question is not seeking information from a third party.

"
2072,i would always be ready to go shopping with you! should we talk about other basics?,"

Directive dialogue acts are used when the speaker is trying to get the other person to perform a certain action, such as calling the police or going to a hospital. 
In this case, it seems like the person asking for help is asking the listener to accompany them to the location they are at, so that the asker can perform an action there. 
  

Question: What is the meaning of the last sentence? 

 

 commissitive: to send 
   
  indirect: send a person 
     
directive: tell someone to 
    
out: yes, you can send one of your people to help them 
      
over: inform yes but broken 4 
          
question: but can we do it? 
           
ind: of course! let me get you a list of things to bring 
       
comm: we need to talk first about the basics 
         
quest: basics
           

"
2073,"ok, i am ready to think of other things.","

 commissives are used when the speaker wants to influence the listener's behavior. For example, if a boss asks you to do something, a commissIVE would be used to emphasize the importance of the request. 
Inform, direct, and question are the three main dialogue acts. The fourth act, Commissive, is used only when one of these three primary dialogue Acts is not appropriate.

"
2074,"you need to make sure you arrive on time, smile, be pleasant and friendly, look the person in the eye and answer all questions to the best of your ability. you'll do great!","

In this example, ""you'll be late"" is an informational statement.  The speaker wants to share information, and is therefore classified here as informative. 
  
""Smile, you will be happy"" and ""Look the other person directly in eye"" are both instructions, so the dialogue acts are question and directive.

"
2075,is there anything i can do for you?,"

Question is used to indicate a request for information or clarification. In this case, it is likely used in response to the other person asking a question. The question is not explicit, but the context makes it clear that it was asked by the person who sent the message. 
  
Overinform is a mistake made by automated text analysis systems. It indicates that a dialogue partner has provided too much information. This can be a sign of confusion or boredom, and it can also be an indication that your automated system misunderstood the conversation partner's intent. 
In this example, ""ok"" is the overinform mistake.

"
2076,would you please show me that mural?,"

Directive is the most general dialogueact, indicating that the speaker is asking the listener to do something. 
In this case, ""Please show"" is an instruction to a person or entity to perform a certain action. 
  
Out ofinform: This is not a request for additional information. It is instead a command to someone or something to take some action or perform some task. Inform is used when the request is for more information about something, and is typically used by someone who is giving directions to another person.  Inform can also be used as a verb, to inform. For example, you can inform someone that you will be late for an appointment. This indicates that someone is going to the person's appointment and will inform that person of their lateness. However, inform is also used in a prepositional sense, as in ""I informed them that I would not be able to make it."" This means that ""someone"" informed me ""that I wouldn't be at the event.""
Question: the question mark indicates a desire for clarification or additional details. A question can be followed by a statement to clarify or add more details, or it can simply be left open to further discussion. If a speaker does not wish to provide details or clarification, they will typically state ""don't worry about it"" or ""it's not important."" 
   
question: this is followed immediately by the statement ""please show,"" which indicates the need for further clarification. ""Show"" can mean to demonstrate something or to reveal something in order to allow someone to see it. Based on this context, it appears that this person is requesting that a mURAL be shown to them.

"
2077,certainly. here you are.,"

This text is providing the information that someone needs do pick the manager at airport, and it does so by providing a location and a time. This text does fall under question and directive act, but it is also providing direction and information to the person who is supposed to do it. So it would be classified under commissives.

"
2078,it looks so beautiful. how much is it?,"

This text contains a direct question: ""how much [is] it?"". This is a typical question mark dialogueact, as it indicates the speaker is uncertain about the information provided, but is also expecting a response. 
  
It also contains an indirect question through the use of ""it"": ""is it [so beautiful]?"" This question is asking about something that is not explicitly stated in the passage, so it can be considered a query. It is possible that the writer of that passage was also curious about how the listener would respond to the question and included this line to prompt a reply.

"
2079,four hundred yuan.,"

This text can also be understood as an acknowledgment of received information, in which case it is classified under the out ofinform category. However, this is unlikely, since the character 'h' in the middle of 'four hou' is not pronounced as 'ch'. It is more likely that the author of that text is acknowledging the received amount of money, and is therefore classified in this example under outofah.

"
2080,that's a bit more than i wanted to pay. can you cut the price down a bit?,"

This text is giving a directive instruction to cut down the cost. The text does not ask a questions, give instructions or make a promises. 
  
  The text uses the word ""cut"" which is a verb. Verb is used in directive context to give orders. In this context, ""Cut the Price"" is the directive message.

"
2081,i'm sorry. ours is a fixed price shop and i can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this.,"

Our dialogue acts classification system is trained on a large corpus of real-world telephone conversations. It uses a combination of deep learning and linguistic analysis to predict the most likely dialogueact given the context of the conversation. In this case, our system predicts commissIVE because the sentence contains a question (what is this best?), a directive (tell me the price), and a request for information (show me this price).

"
2082,"maybe you are right. ok, i'll take it.","

Directive is a special type of question that is used to express a request or order. 
  
  - Directive questions are used when you want someone to do something, such as ""Would you like to watch the movie now?"" or ""Please pass the salt."" 
    
    - In contrast to questions, directives are orders and requests. They are not questions that are asking for information, they are questions.

"
2083,"well, i'll have it wrapped for you.","

""basicaly,  you just cant drive."" is an informational statement. It is not a request, a directive or a commissivo. 
An informational state of affairs is one that provides information without requiring a response. Informative statements are often used in the context of public speaking to provide general information about a topic without requesting that the listener respond.

"
2084,thank you. here is four hundred yuan.,"

overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both possible, so the prediction is overinform. 
the question: this is the most likely dialogue action, as the question mark indicates that this person is trying to find out something, either from you or from some external source. 
  

question: is this a direct question or a statement? If it is considered a  statement, then the answer is no, because the second person in a conversation is not supposed to ask a third person a personal question; if it was a request, it would be a directive. If the statement is classified informally, than the classification is correct.

"
2085,thank you. please come again.,"

the text provided information without directing the other person to act, 
it shared details of the memory of both the speaker and listener, indicating that the information was shared informally.

"
2086,it ’ s so great to be here! i ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home!,"

It provides the necessary information that a direct, declarative statement of regret would provide. 
  
  It expresses the apology and assures the recipient that no more mistakes will occur.

"
2087,we ’ re glad that you ’ re here. would you like a tour of the house?,"

Out of Inform: We don’t know anything about why the tour is being offered. 
Under Informed: Based on this line, it seems like the person offering the offer is not sure whether the other person will accept the invitation. This could be because the invitee is busy or because they don't want to be disturbed. 
  
Question: This line implies there is a question that needs to answered before the dialogue can continue. The question is “why the host is inviting the guest to the visitor to see the home”. 
 Directive: After the question “Why thehost isinviting theguest tothe visitor touse thehome?” the response is the action of offering a guided tour.  The host wants to make sure the guests are comfortable and are able to fully appreciate the beauty of their home.

"
2088,"that ’ d be great, but could i have a cup of tea first?","

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that express a request for a
  action. In this case, it is likely that the speaker is asking the
listener to make a tea request. 
  
Overinform: the dialogue Act informs the listener of something that is
    great, such as the fact that watching TV is now possible. However,
   this does not provide any information about how to go about making the request, so it would be overinformative. 
Question: although the information provided is positive, there is no
     confirmation that this request is possible, and so the question mark
      in the receiver’s mind indicates uncertainty. The question is not
       expressed as a statement, as in “can you make tea for me?” but as
        a question embedded in the statement.

  Directly asking for something is often considered to be a more polite
way of expressing a need or a desire. Here, however, directly asking would
be considered less polite than requesting action from the other
party. Furthermore, asking may be considered intrusive, since the asker
is assuming that information is available that it isn’t. Therefore, in
this case the directive is the most appropriate dialogueact.  

 Commissive: this is one of the rare cases where the command form of
directive (i.e. asking) is used. Commissives are used when the action is 
    imperative, rather that optional. For example, “Call the police!” is an
impolite CommissIVE, whereas “Please call the policeman!” would likely
have been considered more politer. It is important to note that Commissivity is only one factor to consider when determining whether a given dialogue
act is commissIVE or not. Other factors include the nature of what is being
commanded, how much time is involved, who is speaking, etc. in order to
determine the politeness of a command.   

In this example the Commissiveness of asking is considered high, because the person speaking is in a position of authority (the speaker has the ability to grant the requested action) and the time involved is short (it would take a few minutes to prepare the tea). However the informality of directive would also be high (since the actions required are not particularly formal).

"
2089,"sure, i ’ ll just go put the kettle on. why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and i ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen.","

Because the context does not indicate that ""Why"" is a pre-requisite for the action being requested. In fact, it seems that it would be counter-intuitive for someone to request that another person ""put the  kettle  on"" without first asking why the other person should do so.

"
2090,"that would be lovely, thanks.","

""Thank you"" is an expression of gratitude, and it is used with ""you"" to show respect. Therefore, based on this context, this is a Commissive Text. 
  
However, ""that is verykind ofyou,"" is not a direct question or command, therefore it doesnot fall under question. Instead, it belongs to the category ofinform, as it conveives information.

"
2091,do you take milk or sugar with your tea?,"

Question is used to seek information. The person is asking ""do I take sugar or milk with my tea?"". 
Out ofinform: the question is out of character. It is not a natural question for the situation. 
  The person asking the query is a stranger to the conversation. So it is unlikely that the asker would be providing any information out-of-character.

"
2092,"i ’ ll take a little milk, but no sugar, please. make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup.","

Directive is the only other category that is not a confirmation of something the speaker already knows. In this case, 'take alittle milk' is something that the addressee should already know, so the directive act makes sense. 
  
However, if the addresseeperson says 'Of course I will take some milk', then the confirmational act inform is more likely.

"
2093,ok. what do you think about our living room?,"

Question is characteristic seeking of information from another person.
Overinform is an error made when providing too much information. 
Giving instructions is the act giving orders to another.  
Directive is used when you need to tell someone what to do but not give them the option to say no. 
 Commissive means to make a commitment or promise.

"
2094,"well, i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table, but i don ’ t really care for curtains. did you get them at a yard sale? they look ancient.","

Question is characterized by the question mark at the end of the sentence. The question is followed by a statement that seeks to provide information about the circumstances of which the person asking the questions is not aware. 
  
  For example, “Do you think it’s too dark in here?”, “I think the curtains need to be replaced. They look old and worn.”

In this case, it is clear that curtains is a subject that is unknown to the asker of question. Therefore, this is classified here as a queston.

"
2095,my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift.,"

overinform: my parents provided no information, so the answer is ""I don't know"".
question: I don’t know what my weaknesses are. 
directive: answer my question. 
 commissives: punish the person who gave me this question if I fail to answer it.

"
2096,"oh dear. well, i suppose they will do for now. do you ever dust in here? it seems a bit dusty in here.","

Question is a dialogue-act that is used to seek information from another person. In this case, it is being used by the customer to find out why they have been charged double for something.

"
2097,"your daughter usually does the dusting, and i do the vacuuming.","

inform: not overinform, ask aquestion, make apromise orcommitment
question: could be asked, depends on context
directive: tell, do not do, repeat, not repeat
commissive : depends if it's a request or not

In this case, it seems like the message is telling the child not the do a dust-ing but the parent the opposite, i.e. do vacuum-ting.

"
2098,"i see. well, i can help with the chores while i ’ m here. you two could probably use my help.","

Directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used when the main character is telling someone else what to do. In this case, Mike is being told what the helper thinks is best. 
Overinform is an overinformative dialogueact that is used to describe information that a character gives to another character that this other character does not ask for or does ask but does receive less information than the overinformed character was giving.  In this example, both Mike and the helpers are giving information to each other, but the second helper is over-telling Mike, so that he does what Mike wants him to.

"
2099,"that ’ s very nice of you to offer. here ’ s your tea. be careful, it ’ s still quite hot.","

Because the dialogue acts of ‘yes’ are commissives, and the ‘it ’s still rather hot’ is a directive.

"
2100,"my lease ends next month, so i have to find a new place.","

Chinese people often share information to make others feel comfortable. For example, if a friend is about to go on a trip, they might share travel plans to help them make plans in advance. If a landlord is going to sell the apartment, a tenant might ask about the price and whether they will be able to afford it before the landlord decides to tell them. 
  
In this case, Chinese characters 是 can be used to indicate a statement or a fact. In this context, 有 means ""have"" and 不 means"" not"". So the full sentence can mean ""yes"", ""chinese love tea"" or ""some claim that they cannot live without it"". 
   
If the sentence is used in a context where a person is asking a direct question or giving a directive or commissing, then the label will change to question (question, command), directive (directive, request), or Commissive (request, commitment). 
    
For example: 
1. 我的lease ends in next months, I have no choice but to move out. (statement)
2. The lease will end in the next few months. I will have have (to) move. out then.  (question) 或者 (command) I need to Move Out.   (if the statement is followed by a request for a response) or (if it's a commission) Move out, please.    (Question, Commision)


3. My lease is ending soon, and I don't have a choice. But I really want to stay. Can you help me find another place? (inform) 
     
4. Some people claim Chinese love their tea too much, but I still love it a lot. So I hope you can help find me a good place to live.

"
2101,i feel sorry for you. it's a jungle out there.,"

inform is used to find out information that is already available, such as the weather or time. In this case, it is unclear what the asker is looking for, so it can be classified out. 
question is another possible classification, as it seeks information from its conversation counterpart. The ask is clearly looking to get clarification on something, and is therefore classified here. 
  
directly asking for something is classified question as well. Asking for a light to be turned on is asking. Directive is the opposite, asking someone to do something. Committing to something means making an agreement or promise. This text is using directive to ask someone for information.  The text uses commissives to make a promise to answer the question after the person has provided the information they requested. Commissives are used in promises, contracts, or agreements.

"
2102,do you know any places?,"

In the beginning of your message, you mentioned that you can suggest a place to meet. Based on this, it seems like you are asking for suggestions. 
  

question: I'm wondering where we could meet for a coffee. 
overinform: We could go to a cafe, or a bar, a local coffee shop, Starbucks, your house, etc.  etc. etc...
Question: Where would you suggest? 

 

directive: Let's go for coffee at [place name]. 

 

"
2103,well. i guess i can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available.,"

inform is a prediction based on a large number of text samples. In this case, inform is indicating that informa is the most likely dialogueact. 
 question is one of four possible dialogue acts. The prediction model is predicting that question will be one the four dialogueacts most closely associated with this message.

"
2104,thank you. i think i should also have a look at the internet to see if anyone's got a sublet.,"

the text asks a direct question (""can you have it sub-let?"")
it provides the information that the preference is for the environment to be non-smoking
and the individual is unable to handle the smoke smell

"
2105,how much do are you looking to spend?,"

Question indicates a request for information or clarification. The phrase ""what’s thematter withyou?"" is a simple question that invites an answer. 
  Basedon the context, it is likely that ""the matter"" refers to the weather. If the asker is interested in the answer, he or she will likely continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions. However, if the inquirer is simply curious about how the addressee is feeling, then he/she may simply respond with a statement of greeting.

"
2106,"i can only afford about 1, 000 yuan a month.","

Inform is used when the information is provided to a listener or reader to help them understand a situation. The information does  not ask any questions, make any promises, request assistance, etc. 
  
Question is when someone is trying to get information from you and they are not sure of your answer. They are trying different options and asking you for confirmation. For example, 'are you sure?', 'is that right?'. 
   
Directive is the use of tell or order to give instructions to someone. In this case, it's used to tell the listener/reader what to do. 'You should do A, B, C'. Commissive dialogue acts are used for requests for assistance or promises of assistance from the other person.  'Would you help me with this?'.

"
2107,looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs.,"

out inform: the writer is giving information to the reader, for example, ""the exam will begin in an hour""
question: ""what is the exam about?""
directive:  ""open your  mouth"" 
commissive : ""ah""

"
2108,"it doesn't matter, but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route.","

In this example, inform is a good prediction for the dialogue acts of the given sentence. The text is providing useful information about the location of a subway station. This is an example of providing factual information. 
  
However, there is another possibility. It could be that the author of that text was trying to give instructions or make a guarantee. In this case, it would be more appropriate to predict question or directive.

"
2109,anything you need to have in the place?,"

Question is used in this example to indicate that there is a gap in understanding between the two people communicating. The first person is expressing gratitude, but the second person does not fully understand what the first is saying.

"
2110,"i want a bedroom with full bath, and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side.","

inform is a sub-set of question that is used when someone is providing information or facts. In this case, ""i"" is giving information, so the dialogue acts are both overinform and question
question is the core dialogue action of a person seeking information. The person asking is ""I"", so this is also a ""question"".

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue: A Puzzle by Puzzles"" by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, there are four basic types of questions: declarative, interrogative (which can be either declaratively or interrogatively framed), directive and commissives. 
In your example, based on this definition, it is an interrogatives question because the question mark is in the middle of the sentence.

"
2111,you can also check out university bulletin boards.,"

Directive is the most common dialogue acts for offers of solutions. The offer of a possible solution is a directive act. For example, ""Would you be willing to accept another item instead of the one you have?"" is an offer to solve a problem by offering another solution.

"
2112,why? will those be students who are leaving?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact because of two reasons:
1. The sender asks the receiver about something that is of personal interest to the latter. In this case, it is about students leaving school. 
2. Question is used to request information from the listener. ""What's going on?"" is a typical question that a person will ask when they are not sure of something. 
  
Out of question: the question mark is not used in this message. It is more of a statement. So, out of questions, there are only two possible dialogue acts: inform and directive. Both of these are actions that the speaker is taking on behalf of another person. For example, ""I'm going to take a look at this"" is an action that I am taking for you. Similarly, a direct question is ""are you going out tonight?"" which is being asked to another individual.

"
2113,"not really, but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent.","

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the notice indicates a new tenant has moved in, and often low rents attract new tenants. However, there is also a question mark over whether the landlord is actually instruct or inform. If the latter, then the dialogue would be question (inform,question,directive,commissive) and the response would not be informative.

"
2114,thank you. i'll be sure to take a look.,"

 commissives are often used when giving instructions or directions. For example, ""Please turn off the lights"" or ""Drive to the store."" 
  
  In this case, it is likely that ""i want to"" was used instead of ""please,"" indicating that this is a commissIVE.

"
2115,good luck.,"

overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both possible. The speaker may have intended inform but the surrounding text suggests that they are instead asking the question ""well"".

question: it is not clear from the context whether the person offering the apology is actually asking ""why"" or simply expressing a desire to know. 
  
directive: although the offer of a replacement item is an offer to help, it does not express a willingness or a need to accept the change. Rather, this is a request for assistance. 
commissive (also known as request or recommendation): the offered replacement is something the listener can choose to have, and the offering of the replacement suggests a wish for the receiver to comply with the request.

"
2116,"good afternoon, how may i help you?","

the given information is being shared or informed, and
this indicates the presence of a question in the dialogue.

"
2117,"hi, i'd like to order some flowers.","

Inform: the person is asking for information, for example, ""hi""
Question: this person might be confused, they might not know what to do, or they are asking a question to clarify what they want to ask
Directive: This person wants something done (ordering flowers), or is making an order
 commissIVE: I don't think this is a commissively ordered text. I think it's more likely that this was a comment that was cut out.

"
2118,who are they for?,"

the text does not ask a direct question;
it does provide information without giving a directive or a command; and
although the sentence is not a complete sentence, there is a verb and a subject, so it can be classified under question.

"
2119,they're for my wife. her name is samantha.,"

Inform is used when the speaker is providing information to the listener, without asking for confirmation or details. Inform acts are: inform(ative), informative, informative. 
  
Question is when a speaker wants to confirm details from the other person. For example, ""Are you sure?"" or ""What do you mean?"". 
Directive is for giving orders. ""Do this"", ""Go there"", or similar. It is important to note that this act can also be used as a way to request a specific action from another person, for example ""Would you please do that?""
Commissive acts can be seen in the negative, as ""I'm not sure"". This can indicate that the person is not willing to answer the question.

"
2120,what kind of flowers would you like?,"

'oh' is a preposition that indicates the place or direction from which something is observed or known. So, 'what kinds of flower would I like?' is asking for the types of a flower. 
'think' and 'would' are verbs that express the thought or desire of the person asking. 'Think of what kind flowers I could have.' 'Do you think I will like the flowers?'. 
 'like' can be used to express agreement with a previous sentence or thought. The sentence 'you look so much like your mother.' can mean that the listener is very similar to the owner of that statement.

"
2121,i don't know. i don't know too much about flowers. can you recommend something?,"

Directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used to ask someone to do something. In this case, it is asking the person to estimate the time it will take to drive from one location to another. 
  
Overinform is an overuse of information. This is used when the information provided is not enough to make an accurate decision. For example, if a person is given a list of options and asked to choose the best option, overinform would be to provide too many options. Instead, provide the options in a specific order and choose only the first option. Overinform can also be used in the context of dialogue Acts. If a character is giving information to a group and the group is able to process the provided information, then the character could be considered to be overstating the case.

"
2122,ok. what's the reason you are sending her flowers?,"

Question is used to clarify or expand on information provided. In this case, it is being used by the sender to explain the purpose of the flowers. 
In this context, ""why"" is a question. ""Why are you sending me flowers?"" is an example of why being a key word in a sentence. 
  ""Why?"" can also be a statement or a command.  

Note that the use of question in this example is not necessarily a bad thing. It is just an observation of how question is often used in conversation.

"
2123,today's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers.,"

In the given text the dialogue acts are overinform,question,directive,commissive. 
Overinform means the response contains more information than is necessary to provide context for the question. For example, if the message is sent by email, a response that includes the sender's name, address, phone number, etc. is overinforming. 
  
Question means that the information provided is not sufficient to answer the request. An example of a poorly-formulated question is ""why?"". This question can be answered by providing context, but not in the form of the original message.

  Directive means to give instructions or advice. The message does ask for a specific action, so the reply should include a directive.  

 Commissive (or commissivo) means a request for something in return. In this case, flowers are a form a gift, therefore the person sending the email wants flowers in exchange. A reply to this message that does include the phrase ""how about a flower?"" would be Commissively asking for flowers, not providing them. However, ""How about if I buy you flowers?"" is an example that would include both a CommissIVE and a DIRECTIVE. 

"
2124,do you know what kind of flowers she likes?,"

In the context of the given text the word 'flowers' is a general term that could refer to a wide variety of items. Therefore, it is not possible to predict the answer to this question with certainty. However, based on context, 'roses' seems to be the most likely answer. 
  
  Based solely on this single sentence, a reasonable response would be 'yes, she prefers roses.' 
   
However, if the question is about the type of flower, then the dialogue acts would likely be inform (about the general concept of 'flower'), question(what is the specific name of that flower), directive(tell her to pick a specific flower) and commissives (promise or ask her for a recommendation). 
    
Given the above, I would classify this as a 'question' dialogueact.

"
2125,"i'm not sure. i know i should know that, but i can't remember right now.","

Inform (inform, ask, understand, tell) is the most common dialogue acts in this context. Based on this passage, it appears that the speaker wants to know more about what the problem is, so inform is a good prediction. 
Question (question, inform) would be another possible prediction, as the dialogue text is asking the question ""what is wrong?"". However, based on context clues, this is not the case. First, ""sir"" is used to address the listener, not question the information to thelistener. Second, there is no indication that ""i"" (the questioner) wants more information. In fact, in the next sentence, after the ""Sir, what is your problem?"", we see ""I'm sure you should be able to help me with this."" This indicates that it's the Sir's problem, and not I, who is seeking help. Therefore, a direct question is more likely.

"
2126,"well, they're for your wife, so i think you should give her roses.","

This is a request for a recommendation or suggestion. The ""soup"" is simply a topic for discussion, not a subject for action.

"
2127,roses will be fine.,"

Mike is not asking Kira about her identity, so inform is the correct classification. 
However, Kiera is a non-native speaker and may have misinterpreted Mike's statement as a request for information. Based on this, inform may be an over-classification. Mike may instead have intended to convey information by using a declarative statement, such as ""this is Mike"" or ""Kara is Kieras friend.""

"
2128,what color?,"

the text indicates that the two people should chat during their visit to a coffee shop, which indicates an inform (indicates something for which information is needed) dialogue action. 
it is not clear what the proposal is, so the dialogue acts question and directive are possible. 
  

If you want to provide more context, you can add it to your answer.

"
2129,i think red would be nice.,"

In the example sentence, ""thanks i Can watch TV now."", the speaker is expressing gratitude, and providing an updated status on their current circumstances. The speaker does not appear to be asking, commanding, promising, nor interrogating. Therefore, inform has likely been assigned as the dialogueact.

"
2130,do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them?,"

Question is the most common dialogueact in requests for information. The question dialogue acts are used when the information being requested is not readily available or is of limited availability. For example, a customer service representative may ask a simple question to verify that a request has indeed been made. 
  
Inform is used to request information that is readily or easily available. 
Directive is often used for requests that require a response from another person or entity. In this case, it is likely that there is a time limit on when a reply is required.  For example: ""Call the hospital and request an ambulance immediately.""
 commissives are often considered as a last resort. They are a way to express frustration or annoyance. ""Why is it always my fault?"" or ""What is wrong with you?"" are examples of commissivedescriptions.

"
2131,"can you deliver them, please?","

This text does ask for a response. It does so by using the imperative mood, indicating that it's a request for the listener to do something. The listener is not provided with any information to help them do this, so it can be classified a directive dialogueact. 
However, this is a very polite way of asking for something to be delivered. In this case, it means that you would like the person who delivered the pizza to please do so. 
  This is an example of a polite request.

"
2132,what's the address?,"

Question: What's this address of? 
This text is asking for the street address for a factory. 
  
Overinform: This factory does not have an address. 

 

question: Why is this factory giving me an Address? 
 This text provides information that the given factory is reducing its energy usage over time. This is a success.

  

 
  

 Why does the author provide this information? The text does provide information, but it is also asking the reader for an answer. The answer is that this is an example of a company that is successful at reducing energy use and therefore the information is provided to show that it can be done.  The text could have provided this without asking, by providing the example directly in a passage that does mention the company. However, this would not be as effective as asking and providing an explanation.

 
 Why ask? This question is important because it shows that you are interested in knowing the answer to your own question. You are also interested because you want to provide the best information you can to the person you're speaking to. In this case, you would like to know why this company is succeeding at this and how you could be doing the same. If you were to not ask, it's possible that someone else would ask and you wouldn't get the chance to explain. Also, if you do not provide an adequate answer, then the other person may not believe you and the conversation may end without a resolution. Therefore, asking is the most effective way to get an accurate answer and provide a solution to a problem.

 

"
2133,241 main street.,"

'could I have...?' is an example of a non-directive question. It is asking someone a hypothetical question and does not indicate that the questioner is directing someone to take an immediate action
'request your bill...?', on its own, is also not a command. The question is framed as a query, and the request is for a service, not for an act. 
 
However, 'please give me my...!' is another good example that this is likely a direct command, given that it's a statement of fact (the speaker is requesting a specific service) and not an instruction or request for someone else to do something.

"
2134,"what do you think i should do, doctor?","

Question: What do  you think I should  do, Doctor? 
Inform: I think you should continue to follow your current plan to reduce your carbon footprint. Hydro-Electric plants are the primary source of energy for our country. 
  We are hoping  to use alternative energy in  the future, perhaps windpower.

"
2135,why don't you try chinese herbal medicine?,"

the text is proposing a course or action without seeking
confirmation or information
it is suggesting a plan or course for future action

In general, a dialogue acts classification is not definitive and should be used to provide a general explanation of the nature of some of these acts.

"
2136,is it useful for me?,"

Question is a sub-class of directive. Question: ""Are you going to the party?"" directive:  ""Yes, I am going.""

In this example, it is likely that ""I am"" is the question and ""going the the Party"" the directive - but that is just a guess.

"
2137,you have to try at least.,"

inform: the dialogue acts inform and question are used to indicate that a message is not intended for a specific recipient, but is instead intended to be conveyed to all recipients. In this case, inform is used because the message does not require a response from the recipient. 
 question: a dialogueact of question indicates a request for information from a recipient and indicates the need for an answer. The question in this example is about whether the person has seen the car. If the answer is no, then the question is followed by a directive dialogueAct, indicating that additional instructions should be given. However, if the response is yes, a commissived dialogue Act is needed, signaling that no further action is required.

"
2138,ok. thanks a lot.,"

the question is about availability of the book 'the man & thesea'

A:
According to the BIOGRAPHY section of wikipedia, Ernest Hemingway was born in 1899.  He died in 1961. 
So, he was between 20 and 30 years old when he wrote the passage you quoted.   
He was a US author who is best known for his short stories and for writing For Whom the Bell Tolls and The Old Man and THE SEA.

"
2139,that's nothing.,"

""basicaly,  you just cant drive.""

is an informational statement. It is a fact that is being stated without any question or request for clarification. Therefore, it is classified under the informational dialogue acts.

"
2140,what do you need today?,"

Question is a dialogueact that is often used when someone is asking for information. In this case, ""What do I need?"". The recipient is likely to provide a detailed answer, perhaps with options. 
  
Overinform is another possible classification for this dialogue action. This is when the speaker is providing too much information, or information that the listener is unlikely to need or want. ""I need a coffee, and a doughnut too."". Here, there is no need for the other items. However, this classification is less likely in this example, as the answer is very specific and likely needed by the asker. 

Another classification, is question.  ""What?"" or ""How?"" are questions that are often asked when asking someone for help. Someone may need help with something, so they ask ""how?""  This is the type of question that this message is.

"
2141,i need to take a few classes.,"

inform: This is an introductory statement that provides information about the purpose of the message. 
question: this is a request for information, so the answer could be either yes or no. 
	question could also be used as a way to ask a question. For example, ""are you ready for this?"" is asking a yes/no question 
  directive: the speaker is trying to make the other person do or achieve something
  commissive : the person is being commanded or told to by the authority figure in the conversation.

"
2142,what kind of classes would you like to take?,"

Question (question, out ofinform, inform, direct, command, request, suggestion) is the most likely dialogueact given the context. 
  The text is seeking information or confirmation about health claims made by the oolong teapot. ""Isn't"" at end of the sentence suggests the question is being asked by a speaker who is looking to validate or confirm the information provided.

"
2143,how about a driver's course?,"

""a driver’s course"" is an incomplete sentence, so it's not clear what the question is. However, ""a drivers course?"" is not a complete question either, and it sounds like the speaker is expecting a response. So it seems likely that the actual question in this case is ""where can I find a drivers' course?"", which would be a directive question since it asks for a service.

"
2144,"okay, you're going to need to make an appointment.","

Directive is a directive dialogueact that is used to ask for something to be done. In this case, it's asking for an appoinment to meet the requirements.

"
2145,i don't understand why i need to make an appointment.,"

""i dont understand"" is an example of a statement that can be used to ask questions. 
  ""I don’t understand” is used as a form of negative confirmation.  
“I dont  understand” can also be a request for clarification. 
In the context of the sentence, ""i do not understand"", the subject of ""I do"" can act as the object of  the verb ""understand"". 
   This means that the statement can function as an indirect question.

"
2146,you need to make one to come down and fill out your paperwork.,"

This text is a request for the caller to fill a form. Therefore it is directive.

"
2147,i'd like to make one now if i could.,"

Directive is used to give orders or request someone to do something. In this case, it appears the speaker wants to know more about what the listener is doing, so they can take action to help. Therefore, this is a directive dialogueact. 
Question is another way to ask questions. It is similar to asking a questions by starting with ""question"" and adding ""who"", ""what"", and ""why"". In the example, ""Question: what is the problem?"". 
  The speaker here is asking the question to get more information from thelistener.  
Out of Inform, Question, Directive, Commissive are the four possible dialogue acts for a conversation. Based on this example text the dialogue is out ofinform because the  speaker is not asking to find out information, but rather is seeking more info from another person.

"
2148,sure you can ; when would you like to come in?,"

Mike is asking Kira to suggest a time when they can meet. 
  Mike: ""when would  you like  to come  in?""
  Kara:  ""I would love to meet you for coffee""

A:
According to the model, it is a Question.

"
2149,i'd like to come in tomorrow morning at 9,"

This text is asking a direct question: ""Please come into the office tomorrow at nine.""

However, this is not the correct dialogueact for the following text:
""i love the way you think""
In this case, we would classify the dialogue acts as question (about something the listener knows), directive/commissive (telling the other person what to do), or inform/approve (expressing the opinion of the person speaking).

"
2150,that'll be fine.,"

This text is expressing concern, not asking question. 
Outlets are insufficient, so it's a commissIVE.

"
2151,that's great. thank you very much.,"

inform: this is a request for information, not a command or a suggestion. 
question: is this a general question or is it more specific? if more specifically, is the question followed by a subject?
directive: are there any follow-up questions? are any actions required? 

 

 commissIVE: the person asking is telling you what to do.

"
2152,"hello, thank you for calling bradford and sons. this is tracy speaking, how may i help you?","

Question is used in this context to indicate that we are getting more information than is strictly necessary to make a decision. In this case, we get the name of the company, Bradford & Sons, which is helpful information. However, Tracy is also asking for more details, specifically, ""how may I help"" you. This indicates that she is trying to determine if we have a business problem or a personal problem. If she determines that it is a problem with the business, she will offer to help. But if she believes it's a private problem, then she won't offer help and will instead try to find someone else to assist her.

"
2153,"hello. i would like to speak to your director of human resources, ms. jenkins, please.","

Directives are used when the person giving the direction is also asking the question. In this case, it is the asker who is requesting assistance. Directives can also be used in the context of a request for guidance. 
  
Inform: This is a good place to start. Ms. Jenkins is in human resource. You can find her office on floor 12. If you need any further assistance, you can contact the help desk at 855-555-5555.


Question: Could you help me find the clothing Ms Jenkins mentioned?

Answer: I would be happy to assist you. Please let me know if you have any questions. 


Commissive: In some cases, a person may request assistance from a third party without being directive. For example, if a child asks an adult for help, they are commissively asking. However, in this example the adult is not asking to be assisted, but is instead asking another person to do something for them. This type is often used as a form of apology.  

"
2154,just a moment. i'll check to see if she is at her desk. may i tell her who is calling?,"

Directives are used when the person speaking is giving orders or making a request. In this example, she was asking why she had been speeding. This is a directive act. 
  
Out of Inform: This text does not contain any information about the caller. Therefore, this is an out ofinform act, which indicates the content is not relevant to the conversation. The caller could be a friend or family member, and the recipient is unlikely to know this. 
Question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates this as a questioning act
  Question marks are commonly used at end a sentences to indicate a
question.  In this context, it indicates a sentence is open for
interpretation.

"
2155,"this is bill burton from milford insurance, i'm calling in regards to our meeting next tuesday.","

Bill Burton is the named insured in a car accident that occurred in Milford, CT. The car was insured by Milfd Insurance. Milftd Insurance is a subsidiary of Burton Insurance Group. Burton insurance group is owned by Burton Group, which is also owned and operated by Bill Burton. 
  
Mike is Bill Burton, who is an employee of Milfld Insurance and is calling regarding the car insurance meeting.

"
2156,"thank you, mr. burton. can you please hold for a moment? i'll check to see if she is available.","

the text provided information that might change the duration of the journey, so the dialogue acts directive and commissIVE are more appropriate than question or question-answer. 
directive is used to ask someone to do something, while commissitive is the opposite. in this case, inform is asking someone for information.

"
2157,no problem.,"

This is an example of commissiveness, where the writer is looking for an answer or clarification, but is not asking to ask a specific question or provide specific information.

"
2158,"i'm sorry, ms. jenkins is away from her desk. she has already left for lunch. would you like to leave a message for her?","

Ms. Jenkins is gone for the lunch, so it is likely that the message is for someone else.
It is asking for a response from someone who is currently away. This is characteristic for question dialogue acts.

"
2159,how's jimmy today?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact of the given context. Jimmy is a person's name. The speaker is not sure what Jimmy's current status is. Therefore the sentence is conveying information, not asking a direct question. However, there is also a possibility that Jimmy might be dead. In that case, this sentence would be a statement of fact and not conveying any information at all.

"
2160,"better, thank you, doctor.","

Inform: Informative. The speaker wants to share information with the recipient. 
Question: Questioning.  The speaker expects a response from the receiver. 
  Directive: Directed.   The  speaker is giving orders to the  receiver. Commissive : Commiserating.The listener is expressing sympathy to another person.

"
2161,"can i see him please, mrs williams?","

Directive is a non-question asking for a service or action to be taken. 
  In this case, ""can I see Mr. Williams, please?"" is asking someone for permission to speak with the person being referenced. This is not a request for information or clarification, so it is classified under directive.

"
2162,"certainly, doctor. come upstairs.","

Doctor: Come upstairs
Me: Yes, I believe that there is green tea,black tea and herbal tea.  Any others?

In this case, it is likely that Doctor is attempting to give further information or clarification, so the response should be marked as question rather than out of the above list of four possible responses.

"
2163,"you look very well, jimmy. you are better now, but you mustn't get up yet. you must stay in bed for another two days. the boy mustn't go to school yet, mrs williams. and he mustn't eat rich food.","

the text is asking for information, clarification, instructions, or a promise from its conversation partners. 
  
  This is characteristic for a questions.

"
2164,"does he have a temperature, doctor?","

This is a good example of a text that is not clear about whether the question is being asked by the speaker or the listener. The question mark at the end of 'have you got any maps' indicates the ambiguity. If the answer is 'no', then the 'how do I get one?' part of that sentence is the response of someone else, not the asker. However, if the map is available, then it is likely the original questioner who would like to know about it.

"
2165,"no, he doesn ’ t.","

Inform is used when the message is about something that the sender is already aware of, such as when a person informs a friend about a change in their schedule. Inform can also be used to describe a situation in which the information is not new to the receiver, but is provided to help the recipient make a decision. 
  
Question is a more specific type ofinform used for situations inwhich the questioner is unsure of the answer to a question. For example, a salesman may ask a customer a direct question about their needs, and then use question to lead into a discussion of other options or solutions. 
Directive is another typeofinform, usedwhen the person giving the advice is also the one taking action. An employer may give a worker advice on how to improve their performance, while the worker is taking the action of improving their work performance. Commissive, onthe other hand, isused when someone is asking another person to take action, or giving advice to someone else.

"
2166,must he stay in bed?,"

This text does not explicitly state that it is the husband who is making the request. It could be the wife, or it could even be a third party. The question mark in the final sentence indicates uncertainty about the exact speaker. 
  
If the question is about whether the man should stay or not, then it would be an inform (about something that is not relevant to the conversation). 
 If the person asking the questions is a wife or a girlfriend, it's likely commissives (to a person). The wife would ask the guy to stay home from work, and the girlfriend would tell him to do so.

"
2167,"yes. he must remain in bed for another two days. he can get up for about two hours each day, but you must keep the room warm. where's mr williams this evening?","

Question: the dialogue acts of 'yes, he will remain bed rest for two more days' are question. 'he will' is a statement, so it is not a dialogue adverb. The next part of the sentence, 'but you,' is an interrogative pronoun, and'must' indicates a requirement. So, together, these three elements indicate a 'question.' 
  
Overinform: inform is the correct classification for this act. 
 Question: yes, John will, remain, bed, rest, for, two, more, days, you, must, keep, room, warm,
Directive: directive is also a possibility. However, it seems unlikely that the speaker is ordering the listener to do something. Instead, they are asking the same of each other. 
 commissitive: commissIVE is another possibility, as the next word, ""Mr. Williams,"" is likely a name. But, this is unlikely, since the name is mentioned later in the passage.

"
2168,"he's in bed, doctor. can you see him, please? he has a bad cold, too!","

This is because the message is requesting a response from a doctor, and the request is for a medical opinion. The request for medical advice is a characteristic of the question dialogueact.

"
2169,"well, tell me something of yourself.","

directive is the most likely dialogueact, as it suggests the sender will take some kind of future action. 
the text does not mention any action the speaker will perform in future. It is just a recommendation. So, it is more likely to be commissives or questions.

"
2170,"what would you like to know, mr. green?","

Question is characterized by the presence of information requests in the dialogue. In this case, there is no information request, but the request for information is present. 
Inform is another possible classification for this dialogueact. This classification is based on information being shared. However, in this example, it is not clear that any information has actually been shared, as the proposal is made without providing any confirmation. Therefore, inform is unlikely in that case. 
          Directive is also another classification that could be applied to this act, because the proposed course or action is clearly a suggestion.

"
2171,what working experience have you get?,"

Question is the most likely dialogue acts for a text that provides factual information. The question mark at the end of a statement like ""is it raining?"" invites the listener to provide an answer. If the speaker is not sure, they will likely use question. 
  
In contrast, inform is used for statements that provide information but do not invite a response. For example, ""it is rained today"" or ""the temperature is 30 degrees"". 
   
Directive is for commands. A directive text might say ""go to the store"" and a listener will interpret this as a request. Commands are not used to give information, so directive is unlikely here. 
 commissives are used when a speaker wants to make an offer or promise. In this case, it is likely that the person is telling you about dinner. Commissives include promises and offers.

"
2172,"in 2004, i got a job in the sales department of a trading company near guangzhou. i started a sales representative. a year later, i was promoted to the position of sales manager. i had that job ever since, which is just over a year now.","

Inform (inform, ask, tell, don't know) is a dialogue action that is used when someone is providing information to another person. In this case, it appears that the person is giving information about the different sources energy. Therefore, this is an instance of overinform. 
  
Question (question, demand, request, comment, suggestion) can be used to ask a person a direct question or to seek clarification on something. Based on this passage, a reasonable interpretation is that this person wants to know what other energy types are available. Thus, Question is the most appropriate dialogueaction.

"
2173,"oh, good. irene, can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant? don't you like your present job?","

Irene is planning to leave her current job to become an assistant to John. She doesn’t like her present role, but she doesn‘t ask John why he wants her to do this, nor does she make any promises. So the dialogue acts are question and inform and question.

"
2174,"frankly, some part of it i enjoy very much, but i prefer something more professional. it happens that i have a friend working here in this company. she told me the export department was to recruit an assistant. i felt very excited at this news. that's why i'm here.","

inform: the dialogue acts of the example given are more closely aligned with the inform type. The speaker here is providing the listener with information, and is not asking, directing, or commanding the other person to do or consider anything. 
question: although the information provided is interesting, it is also possible that this is just a rumor, so the question type might be more appropriate. In this case, we might want to ask the source of that information to find out more. 
 directive: on balance, this seems like a good time to suggest that we take this opportunity to discuss whether this might not be a poor time for a career transition, given that there are many uncertainties and challenges in the current economy.  
 commissIVE: this type of dialogue is often considered to be less polite than other types of conversation, as it can be used to express strong opinions or make a strong request. However, in some cases, a commissitive dialogue can also be considered more polite, especially when the request is for something the conversational partner is already doing or considering. For example, if the person asking is offering to drive the partner somewhere, that might make the drive more pleasant.

"
2175,"this looks wonderful, madame culot.","

the text ""oh so does i."" is providing factual information, not a request for a response;
based on this information and the context, it is likely that the author is agreeing with what the other person said or is similar to what was said before. In that case, inform is the correct dialogue action.

"
2176,"yes, it's very nice. all our foreign visitors enjoy it. the food is wonderfully well - prepared. let me know if you need any help with the menu.","

Inform is used when the message is about something that the recipient can do something about. For example, a doctor might inform a patient that their cancer is in their liver, and that they need to see a specialist immediately to treat the cancer. Inform can also be used in the negative form, when a message isn't about action but is instead about information. An example of when inform is not used is when there is no action the receiver can take.

"
2177,thank you. mmm. can you tell me about the terrine?,"

Directive is a directive act that is used to give orders or instructions. In this case, it is likely used in the context of a meal to describe the steps of preparing a terrINE. 
  
Inform is an inform act used when someone is asking for information. This is the most likely interpretation of the statement ""oh so you do?"". The inform dialogue acts include ask, tell, ask about, and tell about.

"
2178,yes. a terrine is a kind of meat pate. it's meat turned into a paste. it sounds horrible but it's actually really good.,"

the text does provide information, namely that a Terrine (a type ofmeat pâté) is good
without revealing that the prediction was incorrect, it would be misleading to explain the reason why the classification was wrong

A:
According to the model, ""yes"" is the most likely answer.  The model is providing you with information that you can use to make an informed decision.

"
2179,mmm. maybe another time.,"

In this example, inform is a better choice than question because it provides additional information that would be useful to know. The statement ""we’ve managed"" provides information, but it does not provide a direct answer to the question ""how did you do it?"". Therefore, it is better to use inform here.

"
2180,"you could try the ravioli. they are rather like your chinese dumplings, and the sauce is delicious.","

In this example, it seems clear that the author is attempting to influence the reader's choice. The author suggests a new option that is similar to the original, but with a different sauce. Based on this attempt at influencing the choice, we can predict that this is a direct dialogue.

"
2181,sounds good. i think i'll have the lamb for my main course. what does it come with?,"

""The lamb comes with potatoes, carrots, and peas"" is a complete sentence, so it can't be classified under the question dialogue tag. 
This text is not asking any question. It is providing information. 
  Based the above analysis, ""they are only 20 per dozens"" can be considered as a request for more information (i.e. ""how much does the Lamb cost?""). 
   The text does not give any instructions or promises. So it falls under ""only"" and ""20"" as the request is for information only.

"
2182,"well, you can have fries - french fries - or simple boiled potatoes.","

inform: the dialogue acts of the inform type are used when someone asks a direct question to which the other person has an answer. Inform is used in questions like ""are you hungry?"" or ""what time is it?"". 
question: a dialogueact of question is usually used to ask a follow-up question or to request clarification. The question type is often used with inform to make a person repeat what they just said. For example, ""so you're saying I'm not hungry? That's a bit disappointing.""  or ""you just told me you were hungry, now you are telling me that you aren't hungry is a little confusing.""
directive: when you want to tell someone what to do, what not to or how to act. An example is ""stop smoking"" or “turn off the light”. 	 commissIVE: this type of dialogue is only used between people who are already communicating. Commissive is mostly used for arguments or when one person is giving orders to another. 
	For example: “you need to clean your room” or the “salesman told us to buy this product, we don't want it, tell him to take it back”

"
2183,i'll have the potatoes. what are you having?,"

""What are  you having?"" is a statement, not a request for confirmation. 
  ""Having"" is an adjective that describes possession. In this case, it is used to describe potatoes, a vegetable. Therefore, ""what are"" can be interpreted as a simple question: ""What is it?"", or it could be a command:  ""(Tell me) what it (the potatoes) is."" 
   
  In this example, I would classify the dialogue as being question because the question mark at end of the sentence suggests the author is looking to the reader for validation. If the answer is ""steak and potatoes,"" the writer is seeking corroboration from their listener that this is what they want.

"
2184,i'm having my usual. i like the fish here. would you like some wine?,"

""Would you [directive] likesome wine?"" is a directive sentence, as it contains a request for a response. The response is ""No, I like fish.""

A:
According to this article, ""direct"" is the most common dialogue tag for English.  ""Inform"" and ""question"" are the next most popular.

"
2185,"oh, yes. that would be lovely.","

Thank you can indicate politesse. It is used to express gratitude. 
However, in this case, it is not clear that the person is grateful. They may be saying no because they are busy, they do not want to come, etc. So, this is a commissIVE dialogue acts.

"
2186,"hi, could we have two orange juice smoothies?","

Directive is a dialogueact that is used to ask for something to happen, like a request or order. In this case, it's used as a way to request a second smoothie. 
Inform is another dialogueAct that's often used when someone is giving information. This text is using inform to provide information about what two smoothIES would taste like. 
  
Question is often a used in dialogue Acts to start a conversation. The question in this example is ""could we"" which could be interpreted as ""are we sure"" or ""is it possible"". 
 Commisitive is also a common dialogue Act, and is usually used with a verb to make an offer or promise. Here, ""would"" is followed by commissitive, so it could mean ""we will"" if it was followed with another verb. However, since it is the only commissative word in the example, I'm assuming it means ""if we could"".

A:
According to your explanation, you are right.  Directivity is one of the possible answers.

"
2187,would you like those with yogurt?,"

I would classify this as a direct question because the question mark is used to mark the end of a statement. The speaker wants to know what the answer is. In this case, I think the person would like the fruit with the yogurt. 
  
Would you prefer the apple or the banana? 
 The answer to this question would be either the Apple or banana. Both are fruits and they are commonly eaten with or without yogurt, so the choice of fruit is up to the receiver.

"
2188,"sure, why not?","

 commissives are used when the speaker is trying to get the other person to do something. For example, if I ask you if you want to have a cup of coffee, I am asking you a commissIVE question because I want you to agree to coffee with me. 
  
question: is used to find out information, such as ""are we there yet?"" or ""how far is it to the beach?"" 
      
directive: tells someone what to or tells them how to, for example ""put the book on my desk"" or  ""go to work"" 
          
inform: lets someone know something, like ""the president is coming to town tomorrow""

"
2189,what else would you like to add? we highly recommend caterpillar fungus.,"

There is a question in ""my friend dongdong likes to eat caterpie fungus"" (line 4). The question is ""dongdong"" which is not mentioned in this passage. Based on this, we can infer that ""inform"" is the correct classification for this dialogueact. 
  
However, there is also a directive sentence in line 5: ""i willgraduate from pku this July"". Based off of the information provided in lines 1-4, it seems like ""willgraduate"" should be a statement, not a command. However, since the sentence is part of a larger statement about a person, ""graduating"" from a university, this is classified under the heading of ""directive"".

A:
According to the conversation act classification, your answer is correct.

"
2190,caterpillar fungus?! what the heck is that?,"

Question: What is caterpiller fungus? 
Inform: It is a fungus. 

 
Note that the classification of the dialogue acts in this example is not definitive. For example, if the response text had read, ""What the hell is this cater...fungus?"", then the prediction would have been question.

"
2191,it ’ s a special kind of chinese herb. it ’ s good for you!,"

overinform: this is asking for information, but the context does not indicate that the asker is interested in getting information from this recipient.

question: based on context, this ask is likely seeking an assessment of how bad the person did. 
  
  questiondirect: the question is followed by a directive (give instructions), which indicates that this question was intended to elicit a response. 
commisive: it is possible that a commissIVE (make a Promise) was also intended, although this seems unlikely.

"
2192,"wow, amy, look at that number.","

Directives are used to give instructions or make suggestions. In this case, it seems like the author is suggesting that the wife should receive the rose. 
Questions are often used when you need more information before making a decision. The author here does not provide enough information to make a determination, so they are using a Question. 
  
Overinform: the information provided is too much. This is because the dialogue acts of the following sentences are question:

""These roses are very beautiful.""
  ""I love roses. Do you have any in the garden?""
Inform: this is the only sentence that is not a dialogue, and it provides enough background information for the reader to understand the context. Therefore, this sentence does NOT overinform.


Question: ""These rose are beautiful. Would you like one?"" 

 

Commissive: This sentence is an example of Commissive. Commissives can be used as a way to request something from another person. For example, ""Would you mind holding my purse for a second?""

  

"
2193,what's so great about it?,"

Inform: This is not a request for information, but rather a statement of fact. 
Question: While the statement is true, it is also a demand for an explanation. 
  This is a common technique used in negotiations to make the other party explain their position.  
Directive: It is possible that the person being asked is unavailable at that time. This could be due to a personal emergency, or they may be out of town. It would be inappropriate to ask them at this time for something they are not able to provide. Directives are often conditional, stating that something will be done if the condition is met. In this case, if they indicate that they will not be available, then a directive stating ""Please do not expect this to happen again"" would apply. If they say they'll be there, and then they don't show, a commissIVE would state ""I'm disappointed that you can't be bothered to show up for your commitment"". 
 Commissive (also known as a command): This type of response is used to give instructions to the addressee. The addressees should follow the instructions given in this response.

"
2194,what do you mean? it's a scrim.,"

Question: the dialogue acts of question and inform are similar in that they both ask a yes/no question of the hearer. However, inform is used for questions that provide information about something that is already known to the questioner, whereas question is typically used when the information being asked for is not known. In this case, it is unclear whether the person asking for a phone is making an inquiry or is requesting the phone be provided. 
  

Directive:  The directive dialogueact is often used in situations where the other dialogueacts are applicable. For example, when asking someone to do something for you, or when giving orders to someone. This is because directive is the only dialogueakt that does not require a response from the addressee.

"
2195,"not to me, i wouldn't be caught dead in that.","

Inform is used when the information is already available and the person is providing additional details to explain the current situation. 
  
Question is a dialogueact used to seek information from the listener. The listener is expected to provide information to answer the question posed.  The question is followed by a period (?).
Directive is another dialogue-act that is often used in a conversation to give orders to another person. It is usually used after the name of a person or an animal. For example, ""Please call Sally on her cellphone.""
Commissive means to take action or make a decision. ""You should call your mother."" 
   

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue for acting and screenwriting"" by Matthew W. Winkler, there are 5 basic dialogue acts: question(out, in, dir, comm), command(com, out, command), request(in, request), order(order) and suggestion(suggestion). 
You can find more information on this page: http://www.dialogueact.com/

"
2196,i love that kind of stuff.,"

inform: This is a request for information. 
question: I don't know the answer to this question
directive: Please stop asking questions
commissive : I'm getting tired of being asked questions. 
                  I want to tell you that you can stop.

"
2197,"yeah, you seem to like those styles.","

inform is a prediction based on a model trained on data from a particular domain. In this case, it is trained using data related to Chinese teas. 
 question is one of the four possible dialogue acts that can be used to ask for information. The model predicts that this is likely to be a query rather than a statement. 
question is also the most common dialogueact used in human-to-human conversation. It is used when someone is looking for an answer to a yes/no question or when they are confused about something.

"
2198,sure do. i get a kick out of looking punk.,"

Sure. I get it out a KICK of Punk. 
  I was wondering if you were a fan of the P-Diddy.

"
2199,this one looks really expensive though.,"

This text indicates the sharing of information, rather than a request for information. The word ""looks"" is used to describe something that is not fully described, and is therefore not a direct question. Additionally, ""expensive"" does not describe the information being shared, so it does  not fit into the categories of a ""question"" or a  ""directive"".

"
2200,i don't care how much it costs. i'm rolling in it.,"

inform: the sender is providing information to the receiver, but not asking a specific question
question: a person or animal is requesting information, and the question is not clear or is ambiguous
directive: someone is giving orders to another person, animal, or entity
 commissIVE: two or more people are working together to carry out a plan or action

A:
According to your explanation, inform is the correct classification because the message is for the information of the cost of something.

"
2201,lucky you! i can't buy anything else. i'm flat broke.,"

inform: the information is available and can be used
question: is the source credible? can I trust it?
directive: do this!
commissive (sometimes called prohibitive): don’t do that! 
over question direct, prohibative, Commissive

"
2202,"i got a replace my party outfit, i trashed it last week.","

In this case, inform is the correct classification because the given statement is an expression of acceptance, agreement, where typically the speakers would ask questions, give directives, make commitments.

"
2203,why did you drag me into this? i've spent a week salary.,"

'why' is an interrogative word. Based on this word choice, it is likely that the author is asking the question 'why you dragged me.' This is because the first part of the sentence, 'Why did  you drag  me into  this?' is a direct question. 
  
  The second part, about a 'week salary,' is also likely a follow-up question to the main question: why did the person drag the other person into the situation.

"
2204,"are you on the level? you're the one who called me, remember?","

Question: ""are"" you ""on the le...""
Overinform: the question is not specific enough. it does mention ""remember?"" which could be interpreted as a request for a confirmation, but it could also be a way to remind the other person of the previous conversation. 
Questions: are you sure you called him?  or are we on ""the level?"" you are the only one that called. 
    Are you really sure? 
    I'm not. I called, you said you would call, so I'm sure. But you never called back.

"
2205,"just joking, tonia. i've got some wonderful clothes. let's go and have a close look at your outfit.","

Directive is a special type of question that is used to request a service or action from the listener. 
  In this case, London is the service provider and Tonia is listener, and London wants Tonic to go to their place. 
This is an example of directive question.

"
2206,i have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate. may i ask why i was defeated?,"

In the first paragraph, you are informed of the fact that another person has received an offer for the position. However, in this second paragraph you ask the question ""why iwas defeated"". This indicates that the information provided in paragraph one was not sufficient to understand why you were not selected. This is a directive question which is typically used when the sender is trying to explain the requirements for a particular candidate and the receiver should ask a question to further clarify the matter. 
  

A:
According to the model, ""may i asked why"" is the most likely next action.  This is because the ""Why"" question is asking about a loss, which would be a commissitive action, while the rest of your actions are more informational.

"
2207,"we have thought of you carefully with discretion, but the other candidate has more experiences.","

 commissives are often asking questions, and they are typically trying to persuade or convince the listener to take a certain action. In this example, if the candidate does not speed-up, they may think more carefully before making a decision. 
questioning is another possible reason. The candidate may be curious about the reason behind the decision, or they might be trying out different options to see which one they like best.

"
2208,"experience is important, but don't you think capability is more valuable than that?","

Question is a sub-type of directive. 
Directive is another sub type of dialogue acts. 
  Based off of these two sub types, it is classified under question.

"
2209,"yes, i think so. but how do you prove to me that you are more capable?","

Question is the dialogueact of choice when the speaker is trying to get the other person to do something. In this case, it's the respondent trying get back to the question of how to prove she is more competent. 
  
Overinform: This dialogueAct is used when a speaker wants to give information but also wants the listener to confirm or agree with the information. For example, a salesperson might say, ""We sell this product in stores near you and online. It's proven to be very effective in improving productivity."" The listener might agree that the product is effective, but not necessarily near the sales person. This is an example of overinform. 
Questions: A question is another dialogue Act that is often used to ask for confirmation or agreement. The respondent might respond, asking, “How do I prove I am more able?” This question shows that she's trying  to get a response to how she can prove it to someone.

"
2210,"maybe you can hire me on trial. if i'm not qualified for the job, you can let me go.","

Directive is the most likely dialogue acts given the greeting ""good
afternoon"" and the subsequent inquiry ""Can I Help You?"". The text
follows a standard format of a directive dialogue, where the
interlocutor is addressed and asks a question. 
  
Question is also a likely response given that the first word of the 
   text is ""hello"" which is a common greeting used to start a 
 conversation.

"
2211,good idea.,"

There is a strong indication that the dialogue acts in this example are question and commissives. The first sentence provides context about why the two people are not able to spend time together: the other person is currently dealing with distracting circumstances. This indicates that they are asking for information, rather than providing it. Furthermore, there is an indication of a question in that there are two commas in between the information and the'really'. This is typically a sign of questioning in English. Finally, in addition to commissing, this is the only example of question or commisses in a conversation in which inform was the most likely dialogue action.

"
2212,"excuse me, sir. is there a barber near here?","

Question is used when the information being provided is a fact or a matter of opinion. In this case, it is clear that the barbershop owner is asking if there is any barbeque near the shop.
Inform is not used because there are no facts or opinions being conveyed. The bar owner simply wants to know if anyone is going to be at the nearby bar. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue for Dummies"" by William P. Stellman, there's a couple of ways to determine the dialogue acts of a text. One way is to look at how the clauses are constructed. For example, if a clause is about a past event, then it's about the past. If a person is mentioned, than it’s about an person. Another way to do it, is by looking at who is doing the talking. A third way, which is what I would recommend, would be to take a look what the verbs in the sentences are. Verbs like ask, tell, or ask about are usually about something.

"
2213,"yes, the nearest one is at the third cross of this road.","

overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both possible, so the system is not sure which one to predict. 
question: this is the most likely prediction, as the message is requesting information, making it an question
directive: however, this classification is unlikely, because the request for information is made by the sender, not the receiver. In other words, it is more likely that this was intended as information to be passed on, rather than a directive
commissive : this also seems unlikely to me, since the second person is speaking, suggesting that it was not intended to convey a message to another person.

"
2214,"i'm a stranger here. how can i get there, please?","

Directive dialogue acts are used when the conversation is about asking someone for information or advice. The speaker wants the other person to choose from a set of options, or to take a specific action. 
  

In this example, i'm asking you for directions to a nearby restaurant.

"
2215,"just walk down the road for a few minutes, and you'll find it on your right.","

In this example, ""walk down"" is an action that can be completed by the person hearing the statement. This suggests that ""inform"" may be the correct classification, as the action of walking down is something that could be done by a human being.

"
2216,thank you very much.,"

We invested into a Heat Recovery System because it is more efficient than traditional methods of heat extraction.

"
2217,"unfortunately, according to our regulations i have to confiscate these counterfeit notes.","

 commissives are used when the sender wants to make the receiver take some kind of action. In this case, it is the police who are asking the person to stop counterfeiting. 
  

Note that this is just a classification, and not a prediction.

"
2218,"so, this 500 rib is worthless?","

This text is asking a questions, as it contains the words ""is this worthless?"". 
  
Without revealing which dialogueact the model predicted, you can say that this is a good question as the meaning of the question is not immediately clear. The model is trying to understand the context and the intention of asking the questions.

"
2219,"i'm sorry but it is our regulation, so i must follow it. we will issue you with a receipt to show that the notes you presented us with are counterfeit and have been confiscated. then, if you wish to pay in some more cash, you are free to do so.","

This text indicates the requestor is directing or guiding the dialogue towards an outcome. This is a characteristic directive act, as it indicates a person or entity is influencing or directing another person in a way. 
  
  The request is for a second outting on a specific date, indicating the person requesting the outtting is guiding or influencing the response.

"
2220,"right, i see. let me give you another 500 rib.","

Directive is the most general dialogueact. It can apply to any kind of interaction. In this case, since the question is about availability, and not about travel itself, then directive is most appropriate. 
  
Question is another generalisation of directive. While directive can denote a general request, a direct question can only be about one specific thing. This text can therefore be considered as asking multiple questions, each about a different aspect of the same topic.

"
2221,here's your passbook back and the receipt to say we confiscated the 500 rib worth of counterfeit notes.,"

This text was politely requesting for information, so the directive act was the most likely dialogueact. 
However, it's possible that the request was for a different reason, and it was not polite. For example, if the police officer was asking to search your bag, then the question act would be more appropriate.

"
2222,thanks. now can i make the full deposit?,"

Directive is a dialogueact that is used when the conversation is moving towards a specific goal. In this case, it is the deposit of the money. 
Overinform is when a conversation gives too much information. This is not what is happening here. 
  The speaker providing the information is polite and declining the offer. So this can also be considered as providing more information than necessary. Question is another possibility, but it would be more natural to decline the suggestion with a negative response. Commissive can happen when you are trying to convince someone of something. Here, there is no indication that the person is trying convince. They are politely asking for the extra money, and the response is that they will make a decision after considering the proposal.

"
2223,yes. please fill in a new deposit slip and we can continue.,"

Directive acts are used when the speaker is trying to get the listener to take some action, such as calling a specific person or doing something. In this case, it is the person asking the question who is responsible for filling in the new slip. The speaker (the person who asked the questions) is essentially asking ""please fill it out"" and the addressee is obliged to do so.

"
2224,"ok, honey, time to take down the christmas tree.","

In the above text the word 'honey' is used as an adjective to describe the person being spoken to. This is typical of an inform dialogueact. 
  
However, when used in the context of 'take down Christmas tree', the meaning is not clear. The context does suggest that 'Honey' should be understood as a person, but the use of the phrase is ambiguous. Therefore, inform is a better classification than direct or question.

"
2225,do we have to?,"

Question is used to seek information, for example, ""how did you do?"". 
Out ofinform: This is a special case of question where the questioner is not seeking information but instead is expressing a request or a command. For example: ""stop the car!"". 
  
  Question can also be used as a way to express uncertainty, as in ""are we there yet?"" or ""is it over?"" 
 Out ofquestion: this is the most common use of the word question and indicates a directive or commissIVE dialogue.

"
2226,"come on, it ’ s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging.","

In this example, inform is the correct classification given the context of the conversation. The speaker is providing information about the state of things, and so is classified here asinform. Question is not applicable given that the speaker does not ask any questions. Directive is out of question and commissives the current situation. Therefore, based on this context, we can predict that this is aninformative statement.

"
2227,"it ’ s not that bad, besides it really looks nice in that corner. it gives the room a good atmosphere.","

the text uses the word "" would "" to indicate a suggestion or request, rather than a command or order;
while the surrounding text does contain some commands or orders, it is not the main focus of the message and is therefore classified inform.

"
2228,"a good atmosphere? the tree is falling apart, and it ’ s messing up the room.","

Question: is the atmosphere good?

Inform: the weather in this city is not very good, so it’s hard to have a good mood. 
question: how do u know?  the weather is just a factor, it doesn’t have any power to affect your mood
directive: you should feel happy regardless of how the outside world is
commissive : it would be a shame to waste such a beautiful tree
 
I think the last two are commissives, because the first two don’ t mention the mood of receiver, while the latter mentions that it will be sad if the old tree gets wasted. So I think it is a commisive dialogue action.

"
2229,but it makes the place feel so much like christmas. i ’ d really hate to have to take it down.,"

Because the dialogue acts of the sentence are overinform, overquestion,
overdirective, and overcommissive. 
  
Overinform: the prediction is too specific, so the model is giving too much information. In this case, it is predicting that the listener will know the exact speed at which the car was going when it said ""we went"" and that this information will be incorrect. 
Oversimplify: when a model makes a prediction, you should not expect it to be 100% accurate. The model in this example is oversimplifying the situation, predicting the information it does because it was told the answer in the training data. This is a common problem with machine learning models, but it can be a good indicator that you may want to look at alternative approaches to your problem.  In this instance, this model may be oversimplying that there is no way to get around the limit without breaking the law.

"
2230,but christmas was two weeks ago! it ’ s been there only because we ’ ve been too busy to get rid of it.,"

inform: the first person is giving information, not asking for an order or a request
question: is there is a second person involved, then this is considered as a question
directive: there ’s an instruction or an advice, so this acts as directive
commissive : this act can also be consider as commissIVE, because there’s a third person, involved in the conversation, that can give an opinion or make a comment.

"
2231,"i know, but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away.","

 commissives are often used when the speaker is trying to get the listener to do something, such as take an action or make a decision. For example, if a parent asks their child a direct question such ""Do you want to go to the store?"" the child is likely to answer with a commissIVE such  as ""I don't know."" If the parent then asks the question again, ""do you really want go?"", the answer will likely be a different commissived response such,  ""I really don’t know!"". 
  

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_act

"
2232,"but it ’ s falling apart, and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches.","

In this example, inform is the correct dialogue action because the statement provides only information, not a request for action. The recipient can decide for him or herself whether to take the information into consideration. 
  
  The text does contain a direct question mark: ""the cat"". However, this is not the reason why the dialogue is falling to pieces. Rather, ""The cat"" is a mere example that the writer uses to introduce a topic that is of interest to the reader. In other words, there is no request of action in the sentence.

"
2233,"i know, i know. but it reminds me of the great christmas we just had. all of us were here - - my parents, your parents, the kids, and the cousins - - the food was good, and everybody got what they wanted.","

In this example, inform is the correct classification because the information provided is not specific enough to warrant a question or directive. The speaker simply wants to share that they will be present at the location at certain times. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive

"
2234,"yeah, it was a good christmas. it won ’ t always be this good, but we can ’ t make it last longer than it should.","

""it won’t always thisgood, "" indicates the question mark of the asker, who is looking for an explanation or reason for something. 
but we cannot "" make "" itlast longerthan itshould, indicates a directive act.

"
2235,"ok, fine. we need to take down the tree.","

the text is expressing a wish or desire to alter or change a detail from a certain value to a different value. This is characteristic for a direct dialogue acts. 
  

A:
According to this article, there are 4 types of dialogue Acts: 
Outer: Indirect, Informative, Question, Commendatory, Request, Order, Instructions, Assent
Inner: Affirmative (request), Negative (refusal), Affirmatory (confirmation), Converse (denial)
Combined: Commensurate, Complementary, Simultaneous, Sequential

"
2236,"i ’ ll make a deal with you. we ’ ll leave it up until sunday, and then we ’ ll take it down after church.","

Inform: This is a statement, not a dialogue. So the inform dialogue is not applicable. 
Question: While this is an offer, it does not contain any indication that the offer is conditional. Therefore, this falls under question. 
  
Directive:  This is the most applicable dialogue, as it contains a directive element. The offer contains the words 'we'll leave [it] up to sun day' which is typically used to direct someone or something. In this instance, that person or thing is likely to take the decision on whether or not to keep the flowers up 'til sunDay. This falls directly under directive.  

"
2237,"welcome, how may i help you today?","

Question is a dialogue-act that is used to ask for information. In this case, it is being used in order to request an apology from the customer. 
  
Overinform: This dialogue action is overused in text-to-speech applications, where the system is required to provide a lot of information in a short amount of time. This is not the case in this example, so this classification is incorrect. 
Quitquestion: In some cases, a quitquestion can also be a request for clarification. However, in our example it does appear that a quitsentence is intended, which is another form of clarification request.  

"
2238,"i'm ask for a pizza, please.","

""Please"" is a request for action, and directive is the appropriate dialogueact for requests. 
  
  However, this request is not followed by a follow-up question. The request has a clear goal, to get a Pizza. Therefore, it is classified under inform.

"
2239,then you will be happy to here that today all our pizzas are on sale. two for one.,"

Inform: the dialogue acts are overinform, overquestion, outdirect, undercommissive. 
  Question:  the dialogue Acts are underinform. 
Directive: because of the question mark, and the fact that there is a request for a response. The listener is being asked to express preference or make choice.

"
2240,"you're right, that is great.","

the given expression is a form of apologism for an error that occurred, which is in line with the stance of the speakers to admit their mistakes and take responsibility for them;
it provides assurance to its listener that such an event will never happen in future, so it can also be classified inform; 
as it does neither ask question nor give command, it is more likely to be commissIVE.

"
2241,what size would you like?,"

This text can also be classified under question because the author is likely asking a follow up question to get more information. For example, ""What size do you want?""

If you would like a larger size, you can say so: ""I would prefer a size larger.""
However, if the size is not important to you, then you could also say ""No problem.""

"
2242,"medium one will be perfect, thank you","

Inform is used to request or ask for information. 
Question is a type of dialogueact used for asking questions. It is also used in a conversation to find out more information about a particular topic. 
  Directive is another type dialogueacts used by the writer to give orders. Commissive acts are used when you need to make a request of someone to do something. For example, you might ask someone for a favour. Commissive dialogue acts can also be used as a way to express your feelings towards someone.

"
2243,which kind do you want?,"

This text is asking if the user wants a glass of water or a beer. Based on this, it is likely that the dialogue acts are question. The user is requesting assistance, and the question is to confirm whether the request is accepted or declined.

"
2244,i like seafood on my pizza.,"

Out of question: i like pizza, so i don't know what seafood is. 
Question: I like what pizza is, but i'm not sure about seafood. 
  So i would consider this to be a query.  
In direct speech: thank you, i look foward to meeting you. This is a directive.   
 commissives: we, we hope to meet you

A:
According to the Stanford Corenlp natural language processing toolkit, inform is the most likely dialogue class for this sentence.

"
2245,we have two seafood pizzas. tuna and crab.,"

the phrase 'Surely' can interpreted to seek confirmation from the other party. 
In this case, it is a confirmation question.

"
2246,tuna sounds good today.,"

based on this passage, tuna looks good. 
the text does not indicate a directive dialogueact. It indicates a question and a commissitive dialogue.

"
2247,would that be for here or take away?,"

Question: Would that (be for the here, takeaway)
Answer: Yes, that would be (for the for - here and take - away)

"
2248,that would be to go.,"

This text contains no questions, commands, or promises. The only dialogue acts that can apply to this statement are ""overinform"", ""question"", and ""directive"". However, ""overshadow"", which is similar to ""request"", does not apply because there is not a request for anything. ""Request"" is only used in requests for things. This text does contain a command, in that the writer is telling the reader that it is okay to stop reading at this point. However this is a directive rather than a question or a promise.

"
2249,"that'll be in a ten minutes. please sit over there, and i'll call you over as sooner as it's ready.","

""that’s fast!"" is a statement, not a request. The speaker does not need to know the speed of the car in order to make the statement. Therefore, ""that's fast"" is an informational statement that is not directive. 
Since the directive label is preferred over the informational label, this is classified under directive instead ofinform.

"
2250,no problem.,"

I'm sorry, there has apparently been an error. I will investigate and get back to you.

"
2251,good afternoon. can i help you?,"

the text is asking for help, suggesting that the person help them
this suggests that they are trying to persuade someone else to take an action, and not just asking to help. 
also, it is not clear what the problem is, so it could be a request for assistance.

"
2252,i need some remedies for an upset stomach.,"

This text is requesting a recommendation or suggestion from its recipient. 
  This is a characteristic feature of directives.

"
2253,are you also suffering from pain and fever?,"

This text could be considered as a request for information, since it does not provide any information on whether the person is suffering or not. However, it could also be classified under question if we consider the context of the conversation. The person asking this question is a doctor, and the patient is likely suffering. Therefore, this is more likely a query than a statement.

"
2254,"yes, and i also have the runs","

inform: the dialogue acts inform and question are used interchangeably in this context. The inform dialogue action indicates a request for information, whereas the question dialogueaction indicates an inquiry. 
  
question: yes, but i haven’t seen your company’s car

A:
According to this article, ""question"" is a more general term than ""inform"" and can be used to refer to any type of request.  So, in the example you provided, it could be considered a ""Question"".

"
2255,"i'll give you some tablets that should make you feel better. one moment, please. here you are. take these tablets three times a day swallow them with water.","

In this example, we can see that there is a clear indication that a
course of conduct is being suggested. The speaker has committed to
writing a presciption for this recipient, indicating that they are
directing the recipients behavior.

"
2256,when should i take them?,"

Question indicates the author is looking for an explanation or answer to a general question
Inform indicates an action has already been taken and the reader is being provided with information
Directive indicates a command or order has to be followed and a response is expected
 commissitive indicates there is a request for a reply and response expected.

"
2257,take on after each meal.,"

overinform: This dialogueact indicates the author is over-interpreting the passage and is likely providing too much information, or is being too specific. 
question: this indicates there is a missing passage or information that would provide context for the information being provided. 
  directive: the directive act indicates a command or request for a response.  
  commissive : the commissitive act suggests a request or order. In this case, it is suggesting the reader make the choice between two options, which is an order or a directive.

"
2258,how long should i continue taking them?,"

Question is a special type of informational request that is used to seek clarification or advice from a person or entity. 
  
  In this example, it is clear that someone is confused about a particular action that they have taken, and the question is meant to elicit clarification from that person.

"
2259,"take them for two days. if your symptoms persist for more than two days, you should see a doctor also, be sure to drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration.","

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that signal a command or an order. In this case, it is likely that Mike is giving instructions to take two weeks off work, which is an example of a directive dialogue.

"
2260,thank you for your advice.,"

This text does not contain any question or command, but rather it is a confirmation of the current speaker's state. This is considered commissively spoken. 
  
Thank you again for the advice!

"
2261,"ticket, please. do you have a seat preference?","

Question: Do you know the difference between a ticket and a pass? 
Information: Yes, a tick is a small piece of paper that you purchase at a train or bus station to show that the station you are at has a fare to get you from one place to another. A pass is an electronic ticket that can be used at any station or fare box to allow you to use a card to pay the fare. 
  

A:
According to the definition of Dialogue Act in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_act, ""A dialogue acts are the smallest meaningful units of communication in a conversation.""
In this case, it is question.

"
2262,"yes. i want a window seat definitely, in the smoking section.","

overinform: the speaker is over-informing the listener, providing too much information
question: there is a lack of information in this passage, so the question is being asked to fill in some of the information gaps
directive: this is an order, or an instruction, and the directive dialogue acts are being used here
commissive : this conversation is about to get down to brass tacks, there's no time for niceties, this person is going to tell me what to do

A:
According to your explanation, inform is the best choice.

"
2263,sure. please put your baggage on scale.,"

This is a request for assistance, and the use of the directive act indicates that the speaker is looking for a response and is expecting a positive response. 
In this case, it is likely that putting the bag on a scale is not a voluntary action on behalf of passenger X. It is more likely passengerX is being asked to do so by the airline.

"
2264,what's the weight limit?,"

Question: the dialogue acts of ""hold tight, let's check"" are not clearly directive or commissIVE. It could be question or it could even be inform or directive. 
Inform: ""Hold tight"" is a command, so the ""let's"" could also be considered as directive information. 
  Directive: However, ""Let's Check"" sounds like a request for confirmation, which is usually commissitive.

"
2265,20kg. yours is not overweight. here is your boarding pass and baggage tag. please go to the satellite hall to wait for boarding.,"

'that' is a preposition that is used to introduce a clause. In this case, it is introducing the topic of '20 kg.'. The prepositions in English are used in a variety of ways, but in this context, 'of' indicates that the object mentioned before is the subject of the sentence. So, in the example sentence, 20 kg. is being referred to as the 'weight'.

A:
According to this website, ""that"" is an adjective.  It can be used as an attributive adverb, adjectival adverbial, and adposition.

"
2266,thank you.,"

inform is used to ask for general information, clarification, or advice
question is the primary dialogueact used for asking questions
directive is often used when giving orders
commissive can be used as a response to a command

Note that the classification of the dialogue acts is just a rough estimate and may change in the future as the model improves.

"
2267,what time is our connecting flight?,"

the text does express gratitude, but also contains an element of
anticipation, as the speaker looks forward for the future meeting. 
question is a type of dialogue acts, and the label is based on
information that the response provides. In this case, it provides the
time of our flight, so the reader can better understand the context of 



A:

Thank you, Mr. Sandals, for your kind words. We look ahead to meeting you!

"
2268,"let me check. oh, oh! it ’ s at 3 : 25.","

Inform is used when someone is providing information about something. In this example, it seems like the person is telling the listener what time the pictures will be ready. 
  
Question is when the information is not clear and needs to investigated. For example: “why is it so hot in here?” 
   
Directive is for when you are asking someone to do something, for example “go to the store and get milk”. 
    
Commissive can also be used in place of directive when asking for a favor, such as “can you go to my party and bring a date”.

A:
According to your explanation, I think the prediction is correct.

"
2269,"wow, that's cutting it close! that means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection! what gate is it at?","

Question is a sub-type of dialogue acts that is used to ask questions. The question mark (?) symbol is often used in questions to indicate that it's a rhetorical question. In this case, it appears that the question is asking about how much time we have left to complete the task. 
  
Overinform is another dialogue-act subcategory that describes when someone is giving too much information. This text is providing information on Chinese love of tea, which is an important topic, but it goes on too long. We only had 25 mins to read this, so we need to move on to the next text. 
Questions are questions, commands are commands, and commitments are commitments.

"
2270,it ’ s at... gate 14.,"

In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the request is for the person holding the door to do so on their behalf. However, there is also a question mark over the inform label, because the context does not clearly indicate whether the information being provided is true or false. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the asker is actually asking for assistance, and is not instead asking someone for a door handle. 
  
  Inform (inform, ask, request, order) is used when the sender is providing information to a recipient. Inform is often used in the following circumstances:
- When the recipient is requesting information

However, in this case, it is unclear whether or not the message is being requested of someone, or instead is simply providing the location of a nearby object. If the latter, then the senders intent is ambiguous, making inform the less likely of two dialogue acts.

"
2271,"oh, great! that ’ s at the other end of the terminal!","

overinform: the dialogue acts inform and overinform are used when the information provided is not new to the conversation, but is still important and should be conveyed

question: question is used to indicate that the speaker is seeking clarification or advice from the addressee
commissive: commissives are often used in informal conversations to express frustration, disappointment, or anger. They are less common in formal conversations, where they may be perceived as less assertive. 
  
directive : directive is the most common dialogue-act in the world. It is a way to communicate that someone or something should or must be done. Directives can be given as a command, an order, a request, etc. Inform is often confused with directive. However, inform is more of a suggestion. A good example of when to use directive over inform would be when a person is asking you to take an action.

"
2272,"ok, so here ’ s the plan ; when we land, run to gate 14!","

Directive is a dialogueact that is used to request or order someone to do something. In this case, it is the passenger running to the gate. 
Overinform is another dialogueAct that describes the information given is too much. This is because the person giving the suggestion is also providing the option to decline it, and the latter is preferred. 
  
Question is an interrogative dialogue Act that asks a question. It is not used in this context as the question is about the destination, not about anything the other person is doing.  

"
2273,i ’ m be right behind ya!,"

This text is asking a direct question. The word'so' is used to emphasize the certainty of the statement. 'So, are you right?'. 
  
  The text provides information. ""oh so i"". The speaker is providing additional information to make the listener more certain about their agreement.

"
2274,i need to get my high speed internet installed.,"

Directive is a dialogue acts that is used when the conversation is expected to move in a specific direction. In this case, it is being used to guide the person installing the high-speed internet to a location to have it installed, so they can begin their work. 
In contrast to the other dialogue Acts, directives do not need a response from the recipient of the message.

"
2275,you'll need to make an appointment.,"

Directive is a more assertive response than question or inform. The
recipient should follow the instructions of the sender. 
Question is more exploratory than inform or directive. It is seeking
information from its recipient. 
  

A:
According to the Stanford Corenlp model, this is the answer: 

 

You'll have to schedule an appt.

"
2276,"could i do that right now, please?","

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to give orders or instructions. In this case, it is used as a way to share information. 
  
  The statement provided information regarding the high-speed travel during certain parts the trip, and the information is not a direct question or a request for a decision, rather it shares information to be shared.

"
2277,what day would you like us to do the installation?,"

Question indicates a desire for information. The speaker wants to know what the ""person being asked"" (i.e., the addressee) would like to be done. 
In this case, ""the person"" is ""you,"" and the question is about your feelings or emotional situation. 
  The text indicates the possibility of a request for help. If the reader does not know the answer, they may ask the author of ""what is the problem?"".

"
2278,is friday good?,"

Question is a dialogueact that is used to ask for information. The question mark in the above text indicates the first occurrence of a ""question"" in this passage. Based on this, it can be concluded that the question in question is about information, and not about something else. Therefore, fridays are good.

"
2279,we're only available at 3,"

We're available only at lunch time. 
You can call us at +1 212 688 88 88.

"
2280,you can't come any earlier than that?,"

the text is longer that my vehicle, which is a characteristic that makes the question label more likely;
it is not clear from the context whether the request is for a longer look or for the car to be brought immediately. In the latter case, it would be a question.

"
2281,i'm sorry. that's the only available time.,"

This text is asking a follow-up question and is therefore a commissIVE text. 
  The text indicates the desire for a confirmation or response from its recipient, so the message is being delivered as a request for information.

"
2282,are you available this saturday?,"

In this example, 'are' is used as a question word, and the question is 'am' asking if the other person is available for the specified date.

"
2283,yes. anytime on saturday will be fine.,"

the text asks a direct question about when the person will come back, and the answer is anytime, on any Saturday. 
this text is asking for a directive command. The speaker wants the other person to do something, so the command is to come and meet on Saturday anytime.

"
2284,how does 11,"

Question is one of the most common dialogue acts in human communication. It is used to probe for information, make a request, and to confirm or deny something. In this case, it is likely used in combination with question words like ""why"" and ""how"".

question word: why
based on text: i am experiencing a headache
dialogue act: question
possible question word combinations: how, why, where, when, who, what
example question: ""Why is the traffic so bad today?""
answer: It might be because of rain, which is causing the road to become slippery.

"
2285,we can do it. see you then.,"

Inform: the writer is notifying the reader of something that is happening, but does not request any action from the receiver. 
Question: this is a typical question that a writer may ask to a listener in order to get a response. However, in this case, there is no request for a specific action. 
  
Directive: in contrast to inform and question the author is clearly directing what the recipient should do. The writer informs the audience that they should write a tickets.

"
2286,it's such a nice day.,"

""It's a such nice  day"" suggests the person is providing personal opinions about the weather. This is a question act, as the question ""why"" is not present in the sentence. 
If we look at the dialogue acts listed in this section, we can see that ""over"" and ""question"" are the most similar. ""Over"" indicates that another act should be considered, such as directive or commissIVE. The dialogue action ""directive"" would be a good fit here, since the statement is asking the listener to do something. However, ""commissive"", which means to make promises, is also a possibility.

"
2287,"yes, it is.","

the inform act indicates the speakers are sharing information, but not seeking agreement or input from their listener;
question indicates a request for clarification or additional information; 
directive indicates an instruction to do something; and 

 

 commissIVE indicates someone who is asking for something in a pleading or whining tone.

"
2288,it looks like it may rain soon.,"

It looks as if the weather is going to change soon, but the actual text does not suggest that it is a query or a request for information. It is more like a statement of fact.

"
2289,"yes, and i hope that it does.","

Inform is a directive dialogueact, as it is used to request information or directions. 
  
Question is another directive act, used when the questioner is not looking for an immediate answer. In this case, it's used as a transition from inform to question or directive. 
Directive is the default dialogueAct for questions that are not questions. It is also used for requests for directions or information.  It is often used in questions where the information is expected to be known. For example, ""Do you know where we live?"" or ""Where is this?"". Directive can also be used instead of question when asking someone to do something. ""Would you please pass the salt?""
Commissive, is an optional act that can be added to a conversation to give a character a reason to continue speaking.

"
2290,why is that?,"

Question: ask question
Out of question: question out of ask
Directive: directive
Commissive (also known as commiss): commissitive

In addition, there are a few words in the sentence that indicate that it is information being shared:
the number
of reasons
a number.

"
2291,i really love how rain clears the air.,"

Rain is a natural phenomenon that cleARS the atmosphere. It does not ask questions, give commands, make promises, etc. So the label of the dialog act should not be questioned.

"
2292,me too. it always smells so fresh after it rains.,"

There is a mention of a nice time being spent, however, there is nothing directive or commissIVE in this statement. It is more of an informational statement about how the weather makes it smell so good. This is an overinform statement and is why the dialogueact was classified in that category in our model.

"
2293,"yes, but i love the night air after it rains.","

In this example, inform is the correct classification as the response is seeking information about something.

"
2294,really? why is that?,"

Question: the dialogue acts question and question mark are both used to ask questions. The question question is used in questions that are not commands, requests for information, opinions, and so on. So, in this case, it is likely that the question was included in a response to another question. 
Inform: inform is a directive dialogue action that is not used as a standalone dialogueAction. Instead, inform can be used with a request for an action to be taken, for example:

You should inform your supervisor that you will be late for your next meeting. 
  You can also inform him or her that your meeting has just been postponed.

"
2295,because you can see the stars perfectly.,"

the inform act could be interpreted as the writer expressing their own opinion, which is not necessarily a recommendation to do something. 
question could mean the reader should share their opinion on whether or not the author should make such a drastic change. 
 directiveness could imply that this is a command from the perspective of the narrator, who is likely the person expressing this desire.  
 commissiveness is the most likely interpretation, as this would suggest the change is to be implemented by the listener.

"
2296,i really hope it rains today.,"

Because the statement suggests the occurrence of an error, and the inform dialogue acts are most suited for statements of fact.

"
2297,"yeah, me too.","

This text can likely be classified inform because ""No problem."" can considered a reassurance or an affirmative response. 
  It does  not ask any question or give any directive.

"
2298,"can we have a table for three, please?","

Directive is the most likely dialogueact of ""can [we have] a
table for [three]?"" because this is a request for a service, and the
sender is trying to convince the receiver to do something. 
  
Question is less likely because ""table"" is not a countable noun, so the request is more like a statement. Furthermore, ""we"" in the second sentence is an indirect object, which is typically used to introduce a new subject, not to request a third party to perform an action. Finally, this request seems more directed at the server than at a specific person.

"
2299,"sorry, all the tables for three are reserved.","

This text is asking a question. The question is about tables reserved for a particular occasion. 
Out of question (question), inform(outof question), directive(directive), commissIVE (direct,question,inform,directIVE,commissIVE) are the possible dialogue acts for the given sentence.

"
2300,"do you have a table for four, please?","

In the context of the conversation, it is likely that this is a directive dialogue because of how the dialogue acts are classified. The text is asking for a reservation for 4 people, and the person asking is acting as if they are in charge and making the decision on how many people to reserve.

"
2301,"yes, smoking or non - smoking?","

Question dialogue acts are used to get information from another person. The question dialogueact is used when the information provided by the other person is not sufficient to complete the task at hand. For example, a salesperson might ask a customer ""are you interested in this product?"" to determine if the customer is interested. If the answer is no, then the sales person will try to convince the person to purchase the product by providing additional information. 
  
In contrast, inform and directive dialogueacts are typically used for giving information or giving orders. Directive dialogue Acts are often used in negotiations, contracts, and other types of agreements. Commissive acts can be used as a way to express regret or apology.

"
2302,"we'd like a non - smoking table, please.","

Directive is the most likely dialogueact, as this is what is typically used when someone is asking for something to happen. The person is seeking clarification, and is not interested in the answer. 
  
Question is less likely, because the question is for confirmation, not seeking information. 
 commissives are less common than the other dialogue acts, so this one is unlikely.

"
2303,"come with me, please.","

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to request something from the other person. In this case, it is likely that the person asking is the one who is going to accompany the listener. 
Inform is an ordinary type dialogue action that is used for providing information to the receiver. It is not used in this context to ask for something. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, you are right that directive is one of the possible dialogue actions in the example.

"
2304,i'm a little rushed. is there any quicker way to get there?,"

Question is a sub-type of directive. 
Directive is another sub type of question. 
  Question and directive are both sub types ofinform.

"
2305,"yeah, of course. you can take a taxi.","

inform is used to request basic information or to ask for clarification
question is the most common dialogue action used when someone is trying to find out more about a topic
directive is often used for instructions or requests for action
commissive can be used in place of directive when the person asking the question is also the one performing the action

"
2306,how much will that run me?,"

This text indicates the asker is uncertain about the cost of the service. The askers are seeking information to better understand the costs of different types or services. 
  

A:
According to the model, this is a Question.

"
2307,"it depends on traffic and distance, but it is reasonable.","

inform: the information provided is not enough to make a decision, more information is needed. 
question: I am not sure if this is a good idea. I would need more details to decide. 
  Directive: you should do it!   commissives: but you have to do all the things first. It will take time. And you might fail.

"
2308,do the drivers speak english?,"

Question is used when the information provided is not sufficient to make a decision. In this case, there is a lack of information from the previous dialogue acts. 
Overinform is when a dialogue action contains too much information. This can be confusing or cause the other dialogue actions to be redundant. 
  
  Question: Do the driver speak English? 

 

Inform: the car is old and does not have a radio, so we need to find a way to communicate with the passengers. We will need the help of the passenger to help us communicate.

 
  

 
   

 
     

 
    

 
      

 
        

 
          

 
           

 
              

 
               

 
                 

 
                   

 
                        

 
                       

 
                     

 
                      

 
                    

 
                  

 
                

 
             

 
            

 
         

 
       

 
 

 
Directive:  The driver should try to speak to the person in the front seat next to him. If that does work, they should then try speaking to their passenger.

 

Commissive : The passengers should also try talking to each other in English. They should repeat the phrases the man in front of them said. Then the two people in back should talk to one another in english. After that, we should be able to understand each others language.   

  

   

    

     

      

           

                

                   

                        

                       

                     

                    

                  

                 

               

            

         

       


 commissitive:  The drivers tried to talk with their passengers, but they could not understand one other. The two passengers then tried talking with one anothr in their native language, and it worked. Based on this, we can conclude that people from different countries can communicate inEnglish. However, if the dialogue is in a foreign language and the speakers do not speakEnglish, then it is difficult to determine the correct response. For example, in this example the language is Spanish, however the people are speaking English, therefore it would be difficult for the commissative dialogue to provide the requested information in response to this dialogue. It would also be possible for this to happen if there was a language barrier between the English speakers and Spanish speakers. Another reason is if one of these languages is written in an alphabet that is different from English or if they do use a different alphabet for their language than English alphabet.  In this situation, even if both speakers were able speak the same language they may not be beable to convey the meaning of what is being said because of differences in how the words are spelled in each language or the fact that one language uses special characters that are not in common use in another language that would need translating. Both of those situations would make it difficult or impossible for one side to effectively communicate to another. So in conclusion, while it may be the case that two speakers from two different languages can effectively and effectively speak with each another, this is only possible if each of their languages are written using alphabets that match English and they are able use the special symbols that English uses. Otherwise, without knowing the exact words and spelling of each person's language it will be very difficult if not impossible to know how to respond to a conversation in which one or both of speakers does or does not speak English

"
2309,"some are better than others. but, you shouldn't have a problem.","

Some dialogue acts are over-represented in text classification tasks. For example, in the passage above, ""on strike"" is a strong verb, and the sentence is not a complete sentence. Therefore, a natural language processing model might predict that the taxi driver is asking a follow-up question. However, this is unlikely, because the model is likely to have classified the first sentence as ""the"" rather than ""a"" question (which is also possible, but less likely).

"
2310,are they safe?,"

Question dialogue acts are used to ask a person a direct question. In this example, ""are the children safe?"". 
  
Overuse of question dialogue Acts can make the conversation seem rushed and can come across as rude. Therefore, they should only be used when necessary. For example:

""Are you sure you want to do that?""
  ""I'm afraid I can't let you do this, there's a child in the room.""
When used inappropriately, questions can also come off as aggressive. So, when not needed, you should avoid using them.

"
2311,"for the most part, yes. if you don't feel comfortable with it, then it is best not to take one at night.","

""i am okay, honestly"" is not a question or command. It is an informational statement, so the dialogueact ofinform is used.

"
2312,hey jimmy. let's go workout later today.,"

Jimmy might interpret the message as a question if the sentence ended with a period. However, since the next sentence starts with ""let's"", it is not a direct question but a directive. 
  
If Jimmy interprets the whole text as an instruction, then the classification of directive would be correct. Jimmy is being told to workout with Jimmy. The next clause ""later today"" is a commitment that would make the act commissIVE.

"
2313,sure. what time do you want to go?,"

question is a good guess because the question mark at the end of the sentence could be a form of indirect speech, and the ""what time"" is an open question that invites the addressee to provide an answer. 
based on this, we can predict that ""you"" in the original text is the asker, who is asking ""when"" to ""go"" for dinner, which is another question.

"
2314,how about at 3 : 30?,"

This text urges the person to ""try some!"". The use of the word ""even"" indicates that the speaker is trying to convince the other person, and is not just stating a fact. 
  
At 3: 30, there is a break in the conversation, so the dialogue acts should switch to commissives. However, this is still an example of directive conversation.

"
2315,that sounds good. today we work on legs and forearm.,"

inform is used when the speaker is providing information to the hearer. 
question is the first person singular form of the verb to question. It is an introductory particle used to ask a question to a listener.  
directive is another first-person singular verb form that is often used in place of command. 
 commissives is also a first personal singular conjugation of commissivo, a verb that means to command or order.

"
2316,"hey. i just played basketball earlier, so my legs are a little sore. let's work out on arms and stomach today.","

Directive is the correct classification because the request is for a specific action to be taken, and the information provided is not sufficient to make a decision. 
In this case, I would recommend not working out today, as your legs may be sore, but not too sore to play basketball.

"
2317,i'm on a weekly schedule. you're messing everything up.,"

Inform is used when the message is about information that is already known. In this case, it is not clear from the information provided who the sender is or what they want. The speaker simply shares information they are planning on being at the location. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive: These are used in requests for information or instructions. For example, if the recipient of the communication is asking a question or providing instructions, then the request or instruction is out of order.

"
2318,c'mon. we're only switching two days. you can do legs on friday.,"

Directive is a special kind  of question that is used to ask someone to do something. In this case, it is likely that someone is being asked to switch days with the person. 
Question is the most common dialogue  act in this context. It is possible that this person is not sure what day to swap and is trying to find out. 
  
Out ofinform: This is information that we are not supposed to give out, so the response is out of scope.  

"
2319,aright. i'll meet you at the gym at 3 : 30 then.,"

Directive is a prompt for a response. In this case, a confirmation that 3:30 is the time and place for the meeting. 
Question is another prompt to a reply. The person asking the question is looking for an explanation, so the reply should be a direct answer. 
   

A:
According to your explanation: 

 
 The dialogue acts of the example text are question and directive. Question is used to ask for clarification, and directives are used for instructions.

"
2320,i have some great news! i was able to switch to the night shift!,"

Inform is used when the message is not clear and the writer is looking for clarification. In this case, it is likely that you were able switch from day shift to nightshift, but the reader does not know this. The writer wants to know if the person reading the mailbox is happy for them to share this information with the receiver. 
  
Question is when someone is asking a direct question and is expecting a specific answer. Here, since the question is about the bed size, and since this is the first time the asker is hearing about this, they are expecting the answer to come from the other person. So, this makes this a Question.  

"
2321,i knew everything would work out for you!,"

Inform (or overinform) is a dialogue-act type that is used when the speaker is providing information to a listener, but also includes information that the listener should know. 
  
  In this case, it is the information of distance and travel-time that are provided to the driver of a car. The driver can use this information if he wants to know the estimated travel distance.

"
2322,i got to meet the night anger today too. we got along right from the start.,"

Out of question: the question mark indicates that the speaker is uncertain about something, and thus the inform act would be a better choice. 
Question: this is a common choice for a dialogue acts when the information provided is not sufficient to make a decision. 
  
  Directive: giving instructions is another common dialogue action for providing information. In this case, inform is less likely, as the instruction is more directive than informational.  For example, ""Turn on all the outlets"" is directive while ""There are only a few outlets turned on"" would likely be informational
Commissive : making commitments is also an informational dialogue  action, but it can also express a sense of urgency or a desire for the other person to do something. For example ""Call the plumber now!"". This is likely the case here, since the speakers are expressing concern for what will happen if there aren't enough of them.

"
2323,wonderful! do you already have your work schedule?,"

Question: ""the work sched""
Overinform: I don't have a work scheduling yet. 
Quit questioning me! I'm busy!
Directive: Please tell me your schedule! 

 

A:

I think the question mark is overinform.  The text is providing information, so it is not a direct question.

"
2324,"not yet, i pick it up tomorrow.","

In this example, inform is the correct classification as the statement provides only information, not a request for action.

"
2325,do you know what you will be doing yet?,"

Question: over inform (tell me what will happen next), question  (what will you be doin?), directive  or commissIVE (give me your number). 
  
Out of question:  

"
2326,"yes, i'll be managing the guys on the dock.","

the text does provide a reason for the management, so it is not a direct question
it does ask for a response so the answer is commissIVE
there is no statement in the passage that indicates the information is shared

In summary, inform is the correct dialogue action for this passage, because the statement provided by the manager is an indication that they will be taking on additional responsibilities, and is therefore not an information request.

"
2327,you're so good with people. i think they will like you!,"

Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the only one that is not a statement of fact. Rather, it is a way of conveying information without stating it outright.

"
2328,"next, please. may i help you, sir?","

Question is a request for information or clarification. The ""may i"" phrase is used to introduce a new topic or request information from the listener. 
  

In this case, ""May I help You, Sir?"" implies that the speaker is asking the person who is listening to help them. This is because the ""Sir"" part of the phrase acts as a title for the addressee, and the use of ""help"" implies the need for assistance.

"
2329,"hello, yes, i ’ d like to open a bank account.","

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that indicate that the
  sender is giving orders to the receiver. In this case, Mr Sandels is
asking Michelle to do something. 
Overinform is another special kind of directive dialogue
    act. It indicates the sender is over-informing the recipient of
   something. Mr sandels isn’t giving any orders here, he is simply
informating Michelle. 
  Question is the most common type. This is used when the speaker is 
   seeking information from the listener. The question mark indicates
that the information is being sought for the first time.

"
2330,"certainly, i can can help you with that. what type of account would you like to open? a chequing or a savings account?","

Question dialogue acts are used to find out information or to request clarification. In this case, it appears that someone is asking the person speaking whether they would like a particular type or account type opened. 
  
Out of question: I'm not sure I understand the question. Please rephrase it so that I can provide an answer. 
Inquire: What type do you want to have opened?  a chequeing account or  a  savings  account ? 
 
Request clarification: I'm looking for the best account for my needs. I would prefer a checking account because I prefer to pay my bills with cash, but I am open to a Savings account if that is the better option for you.  
 Out of request: Clarification: Are you looking to purchase a Cheque or Savings Account?   
 Inquire further:         Purchase a Checking Account  or      purchase Savings Account 
 Out of question:     I’m not clear on what you are asking. Can you please reword your question?

"
2331,what what features do they offer?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact given the context. The speaker wants to know the name of a medication that can help with their headache. 
Overinform is unlikely given that the information provided is sufficient to understand the problem. A headache is not a life-threatening condition, and a person can get through many days without the need for medication. 
  Question: What is this medication called? Overinform: I don't know, ask the Doctor. Question: Ask the Doc.

"
2332,"well, if you just take a look here, see, with our chequing account, you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee, and our savings account has a higher interest rate, but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10, 000 dollars.","

This text indicates the information provided is for the purpose of providing details to another person. The details provided are for their benefit and are not a request for payment.

"
2333,"i see, well, i think i ’ m more interested in a chequing account. i like to have easy access to my money.","

This text indicates that the speaker is trying to convince the other person to take an action, and the action the person is being urged to takes place in the realm of finances. The use of the word “chequ” in this context suggests that this person should open a new bank account, since “checking” is a common synonym for “finances” or “money”.

"
2334,"alright, then, with this chequing account you ’ ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book. will you require overdraft protection? there is an extra fee for that.","

This text provides information to the person receiving it about an action the sender took. This is a directive message, as it tells the receiver what to do.

"
2335,"no, that won ’ t be necessary.","
  The text is a command, so the dialogue acts are commissives. 

A:

This is an example of a commissivo text.  A commissiva text would be one of question or directive.

"
2336,"in that case, i ’ ll get you to fill out this paperwork. i ’ ll need your social insurance number, and two pieces of government id. if you could just sign here, and here, and here. we ’ ll be all set. would you like to make a deposit today?","

""Surely"" is a form of "" surely ofcourse"" which can mean "" certainly"" or "" undoubtedly"". This phrase can also be used to emphasize a point or make an emphatic statement. In this case it is used by the speaker to seek confirmation from thelistener. 
  
  Based the context, it seems like the  speaker is asking the question if they will be able to get the required documents from  the listener.

"
2337,"yes, i ’ d like to deposit one billion dollars.","

Directive acts are used when you want to make someone do something. In this case, you are asking the person to put one trillion dollars into a bank account. 
  
Out ofinform: the directive act does not provide any information that is not already provided in the question. Therefore, this is an out ofinformation directive.  

"
2338,"would you check the engine, please? it is knocking.","

Because the dialogue acts are not clearly discernible from the given text alone, without any context.

"
2339,sure. do you want to have the car washed?,"

Question is the most likely dialogueact because the question word ""Which"" is used in the first sentence and it indicates that the speaker is seeking information. 
  In the second sentence, ""Do you Want the Car washed?"" the word want indicates a request.

"
2340,"yes, please. when can you get it done?","

Question dialogue acts are used to ask someone a direct question. The question mark in the above text indicates this dialogueact. 
  
Overinform,  question, direct, command: This is because the given statement is a general statement about a topic and does  not contain any specific details. So, it can be classified under question dialogue  act as the question is used for getting more details about the topic. 
 commissives are not used in this example. commissivo dialogueacts are for making promises or giving orders. In this case, there is no indication that this statement was made to a person or is making a request of them.

"
2341,"you can pick it up in half an hour. by the way, how are you going to pay, cash or credit?","

Question is the most likely dialogueact here as it is used to ask for clarification on something that was previously said.

"
2342,by credit.,"

Of course I do. 
In this example, inform is the correct classification, because the response is providing information in confirmation of a statement.

"
2343,have you decided what you ’ re going to do during your holiday?,"

Question: I haven’t decided yet what I’m going
to do on my holiday. 
  Inform: Well, I can tell you that you’re going 
on a holiday and that it’s a great opportunity ʻ
for you to relax and have fun. I will write  you a
prescription for a medication that will help you ˆ
sleep better at night.

"
2344,yes. i ’ m going to travel around europe.,"

This text is a reply to the offer of a tour around Europe. Based on this context, it is likely that the person offering the tour is disappointed and is now trying to convince the listener to change their mind. In this case, we can classify the reply as directive.

"
2345,"wow, that sounds great! where are you going?","

Question is associated more with seeking information, whereas the other dialogue acts are more associated  with expressing opinion or giving orders. 
  

A:
According to the dialogue Acts classification, your answer is correct. The text i have problem is asking question.

"
2346,i think i will start off in paris. then i ’ m going to take the train to nice and then go on to milan.,"

In the first sentence,'sir' is used to indicate the subject of a sentence. Based on this, it is inferred that 'you' (the listener) is the one who is going. Hence, this sentence is classified under question. 
  
However, in the second sentence 'I'll go' indicates the action that is being offered. This falls into the category of directive.

"
2347,oh that will be lovely. you ’ ll be able to do lots of shopping i expect.,"

 commissives are used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision. For example, a commissIVE would be if I were you, and were given the choice between eating a delicious meal or going to a party on Saturday night, I would choose the party. The choice isimplied to be a Commissive because the Commissives provide additional information that is needed to determine an appropriate response. 
Out of Inform: the instructions or requirements are for someone else, not for the person being instructed. 
 Out of question: I am not sure I will enjoy the meal, or I don’t know what to cook. I’ll need to spend some time thinking about it.  
 Out Of Directive: you should cook the dinner, because I expect you to. You should not cook this meal if you do not know how to properly cook a meal. If you are not able or willing to prepare the food, then you need not prepare it for me.   
 Question: what is the best way to follow the directions? Should I start with the chicken or the fish? Do I need any other ingredients? 
 In Directives: cook it thoroughly, don't overcook the meat, use the right seasoning, add some vegetables, be sure to use a sauce.

"
2348,oh yes and try lots of new food too.,"

Directives are used when the information being provided is not relevant to the conversation, but is still important for the receiver to know. For example, a manager might give a subordinate a task that is outside of their normal responsibilities, and would be more comfortable hearing that they have done their best to complete the task. In this case, it would make sense for them to use a directive rather than a request, since the subordinate does not need to provide information that does them no good, is unimportant, or would otherwise be a waste of time for both parties. 
  
Out ofinform: This is used to describe a statement that contains information but does little to explain the reason for which the statement was made.  For example: ""I was pulled  over for speeding"" - this is an out ofform statement, because it explains why the driver was stopped, however it does nothing to help the listener understand why they should be speeding.

"
2349,great. make sure you buy me a souvenir!,"

directive is a type of dialogueact, where the speaker is making a request or order. In this case, it is the request for a gift. 
question is used to ask for information. The question ""what is weed?"" is not answered in this passage. 
  
inform is another type  of dialogueAct, used when the information is being given to the listener. Here, ""weed"" is mentioned and the inform dialogue Act is likely used.

"
2350,"oh, don ’ t worry, i will!","

I don’t know what kind food you normally eat. 
It could be that you are asking me a general question about food, or you could just be curious about what I eat, so I should answer your question as best as I can.

"
2351,it ’ s nice meeting you.,"

Out of question: this is not a request for information, but a statement of fact. 
Question: the speaker is asking a direct question. 
  The question is: "" who are you?"". The answer is "" I am a sandal salesman"". 
 Out of directive: there is no command or order in this message.  
 Commissive: it is possible that the message is a threat, however, it does  not fit this category.   

A:
According to the GPT-2 model, this answer has the following probability: 0.947.

"
2352,"it ’ s nice to meet you, too.","

This text is inform because there is some information shared between the two speakers (it’s nice), and the information is shared in the form of an instruction (please). However, there isn’t enough information provided to determine the type of instruction. The text does not specify the action that the person being instructed to take (i.e. put their hand behind the head), nor does it provide any context for why the arrest is taking place (eating a meal, getting dressed, etc.).

It’ s a nice day, isn't it?
Yes, it is.

"
2353,i am happy to be speaking to a presidential candidate.,"

Out of the four possible labels for the dialogue acts in the above list, inform is the most appropriate. This is because the statement provides useful information, and the candidate is a potential listener, so the information is being shared with that listener rather than with an audience of one.

"
2354,would you like to ask me anything?,"

Question is a special type of dialogue acts that indicate that the speaker is seeking information from the listener. In this case, ""anything"" could be a suitable response. 
  
Overinform: the dialogue Act label is question because the information provided is sufficient to answer the question. The speaker assumes that a response will be forthcoming. However, it is possible that no response is forthcoming, in which case the conversation will terminate naturally. 
Questions are often used in text-based interfaces to elicit user input. For example, a user may be able to provide a simple answer to a ""yes/no"" question by selecting a checkbox on a web page. If the user is able provide an answer, then the system can take appropriate action, such as sending the answer back to the server. Otherwise, if the response from user to question is ""no"", then it may trigger a dialog with a support agent to help the customer understand why no answer is available.

"
2355,what do you feel about gay marriage?,"

Question: Is there any service or assistance that I can provide to this recipient? 
Overinform: We don't provide service to same-sex couples. 



question: Can you provide me with a recommendation for a restaurant? 
  question, overinform, seek information: I'm happy to recommend a few options. 
   

Directive: Please provide assistance to these individuals.  
  directive, ask for assistance, Commissive : I think we should respect the wishes of these couples and not provide any services that are available to opposite-gender couples


I think the answer to your question is that we shouldn't give service/assistance to gay couples because we don’t provide services to other couples that might be considered different.

"
2356,i think everyone has the right to love who they want.,"

Statement 1: ""my"" and ""name"" are used as the subject and possessive pronoun, respectively. This indicates that the name belongs to the speaker. 
  
  Statement 2: the place where the author lives is Beijing. Beijing is a city in China. It is likely that this statement is providing additional information to help the reader understand where Beijing can possibly be located. 
Birth year: 1980 is an exact year. The author is most likely providing this information so that readers can understand when the mentioned person was most recently born.  This is also a way to provide context for the graduation statement. A person may not graduate until many years after their birth. Thus, it would be reasonable for this person to mention when they graduated from high school or college.   
Expected graduation: this is another statement that provides information. Based on this, one can assume that there is some timeframe in which the student is expecting to graduate. For example, a student who is in their last year of highschool may expect to finish their high-school degree in a few years. In contrast, someone who has graduated college may have already graduated and are looking to start a new career.

 Statement 3:  The author has majore in accountancy. Accountancy is one of the most popular majors in universities in china. As a result, accounting is probably a very popular career choice for people who majorer in this field. Additionally, this provides context to understand that accounting may be a popular major for students who major in that field

"
2357,would you legalize gay marriage?,"

Question: would you (verb)?
Answer: I would not legalized gay marry (adjective). 
  The verb ""legalize"" is an action verb, so the answer should be a negative response. 
   However, if the question is about whether to do something, then the directive dialogue acts would be appropriate. For example, ""Would you consider legalizing gay marriages?""

Would I legalizr gay marrige?

"
2358,"yes, i would.","

This is the commissIVE dialogue action:

To ask for information or explanation, especially when one is not sure about a matter: 
""what do you mean?""
  ""i don't understand""
Examples: ""i asked you what was wrong, and you said you didn't know, what do I do now?""

"
2359,many people won ’ t like that.,"

Inform is used when the speaker is giving information to the listener. In this case, it seems that the person is sharing a proposal or plan for how the two of you can spend your time while at the coffee shop. 
  
Question is when a speaker wants to know something from the hearer. The inform part of a question is omitted, and the question itself is the main part. For example, ""why don't you like it?"". Here, we don’t know why the other person doesn’ t want to go to coffee shops, but we do know that it’s a good question to ask.  

"
2360,"i ’ m sure they won ’ t, but that ’ s my view on gay marriage.","

Out of question: the response does not mention the question of whether or not they have any maps available of Downtown. 
Question: yes, they do have some maps. 
  They are available at the library.  

Inform: i ’m sure that they don’t have a map of  Downtown, however, that is my opinion on  gay marriage,  which is a topic that I am passionate about.

"
2361,i really like you.,"

Inform is a question asking for information. The speaker here is not giving information, they are asking information from the listener. 
Question is another question-asking dialogue action. In this case, it is asking if the other person likes the information given. 
          In this example, i really liked you, but you might not like this. I am not sure if I like it, so I'm asking.  
Directive is an instruction or a command. Here, we can assume the person giving the flowers is the one who is commissiving, and the wife is being directed to accept the gift.   
 commissitive is used to describe a conversation where both parties are commissively commissing. Since the husband is telling his wife what to do, she is also commissng him.

"
2362,i really appreciate that.,"

This text can also be understood as an acknowledgment of provided information, aligning with question and directive dialogue acts.

"
2363,"hello? this is john smith. can i speak to mr. white, please?","

Mr. White is the intended recipient of the message, so the directive act indicates the author is directing the communication towards an intended receiver. Additionally, Mr.White is mentioned specifically in the second sentence of text. This suggests the writer is expecting a response from Mr White, and is therefore attempting a suggestion or request. 
  
  

"
2364,this is mr. white speaking.,"

This text indicates the availability of items in each of 6 rooms. This is not a request for information, it's an indication of shared details. 
In addition, this is Mr. White speaking, so it can't be question or directive. Commisive is also not applicable, as it only applies to requests from machines.

"
2365,"hi. i understand that you have a house for sale, haven ’ t you?","

Question indicates the sender is looking for information. 
  In this case, I am looking to understand more about your house-for-sale. 
Inform indicates I was able to provide you with enough information to answer this question yourself. I would be happy to elaborate further if you like.  

question
I understand you’ve got a nice house, but what I’m really looking at is a different type of home. What I mean is, is it in a good neighborhood? Is it close to public transportation? What’s the square footage? 
 - question
Yes, that’ s the right type home for me. It’ is in the perfect neighborhood and is within my budget. The house is about 1,000 square feet and it’ a few minutes from the subway.

"
2366,yes.,"

'certainl y, sir.' can interpreted in two ways:

As a confirmation of a request or statement made earlier in the conversation: ""you certainly are right, Sir.""
Or as providing assurances to another person:  ""of course, Mr. Smith.""

"
2367,i ’ d like to know more about it.,"

Directive is a special type of question word that indicates that a statement or question is being asked to someone else. In this case, it is asking the speaker if they would like more information about the topic. 
  
Question is another special kind of word used in the same way as a directive question. However, a question questioner is seeking information from someone, whereas a direct question asks someone for something.

"
2368,can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o ’ clock?,"

Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that is used to ask someone to do something. In this case, it is likely that “come to” is an action that requires someone’s presence, so the asker is directing the receiver to perform that action. 
  
Out ofinform: This is not a reply, but a request for clarification. The askers is probably not aware that there is more than one category of tea, and so is requesting confirmation. 
Question: the question mark indicates that this is something the person asking is uncertain of, or needs to confirm.

"
2369,ok. i will be there.,"

 commissives are used when the information provided is not enough to understand the full intent of a speaker. For example, if a person is giving you directions and you do not fully understand what they mean, they may say, ""check the map again"" or ""slow down, it is very busy here"". In this case, you need to ask them to repeat themselves or provide more information so you can fully follow their directions. 
  
overinform: This is the default classification for non-assertive speech acts. It is used to describe that a conversation participant is providing too much information about something without indicating that they have an opinion or are making a claim. Inform, for example is often overinformative. ""I think you will like this movie. I have seen it many times."" 
 question: A question is a speech act used by someone who is seeking information from another person. The question ""are you ok?"" is an example of asking someone for information. A person who asks a question may not have all the necessary information to provide an answer, so they need the person they're speaking to to also ask a questions in order to gather more info. If the other person does not ask questions, then the question asker may assume that person has all of their information and therefore assume they know more than they actually do.  In this example ""yes, i am ok."" is considered a response to the ""i think"" question. 
directive: Directives can be used in any conversation, but are especially common in conversations between two people. They are often used for giving instructions or making requests. Directive is also used as a classification when a non speaker (such as an AI model) is trying to express their opinion on a topic. An example directive is ""this is my favorite song."" This would be classified under question because the model is asking for someone's opinion. However, this is because they believe they already have the opinion of everyone around them, and they just want to share their favorite with the world. So the answer is that this song is their ""favorite"" because it was their directive to tell everyone their 'favoritest song.' 
 commissIVE: Commissives  are used  when the  information provided by a  speaker is insufficient to fully express the intent. Commissives include warnings, reminders, suggestions, etc. for the receiver to consider. Consider the following example: ""Please check the street before you drive down it."" In the example above, there is no indication that there was a problem on either the driver or the pedestrian's part. But the warning is sufficient to remind both parties to check their surroundings before proceeding.

"
2370,thank you for calling. goodbye.,"

the text does imply that it is a request for information, since the caller asks a ""how many"" question;
it is also a recommendation, as the call ends with the instruction ""12 will do"";
based on context, it could also be a command, given that ""goodbye"" is the response to a call; however, this is not the case here, where the ""hello"" at the beginning of the conversation is followed by a statement that is clearly not a direct command.

"
2371,bye.,"

inform: the dialogue acts inform and let are used to indicate that a response is not relevant or helpful, and should be ignored. In this case, let is used in the sense of “let me” and inform is the correct classification. 
  
question: this dialogue action is often used when a listener is trying to understand something, but is uncertain about the answer. The question dialogue is a way to encourage someone to answer, or to clarify information that is unclear.  In this example, it seems like the person asking the question is unsure of the information they are being provided, so the response of ‘no, that’s longer your car’ is likely to be helpful. Therefore, this is classified here as a question.

"
2372,please fill in the arrival card and sign the register.,"

This text is a request for the customer to fill the card, sign and leave. The customer is the direct recipient of the message. Therefore it is classified under directive. 
  
However, if the sign is not required, then the classification would be commissIVE.

"
2373,all right. which room shall i have?,"

""The text provided information without a direct question or instruction. It is therefore a form of sharing or sharing knowledge.""

A:
According to this article, ""question"" is one of the six basic dialogues in AI.  The others are ""request"", ""answer"",  ""confirm"", and ""refer"".  
In the context of your example, I would say that the question is ""which room?"".

"
2374,"room 202, but i'm afraid we have to ask for a deposit of $ 200.","

This text is considered to have a command or request in it. The speaker wants the person in the room to do something, so they are asking for the payment of the requested amount. 
  

A:
According to the GPT-2 model, this is a question: 
Question: Can I get the pictures of my trip tomorrow?
GPT2's response: Question, Can, I, get, pictures, of, my, trip, tomorrow?,?

"
2375,"marketing manage office, can i help you?","

Question: ""Can I help You?""

Overinform: the request for information is too general, there is no request or request of a specific nature. 
Questions: Can you help me find a parking space? Can I borrow some money?  Can you give me a hand? 
 Question is a very common dialogue acts, which indicates that the information being requested is not specific enough. In this case, ""can I"" is the question. 
 

Inform: this is an affirmative response. The speaker is acknowledging the offer of help and is indicating that they will consider the suggestion.

 
 
Directive: in this example, this dialogue action is used to request a service or action. It is followed by a verb, such as ""go"" or ""call"", which is typically used for action requests. This is because the action of going to find the parking spot is implied. However, in the example provided, no action has yet been requested. 

  Directives are used when the recipient of the message has a clear and specific action to take. For example:
""Call the plumber. He needs to fix the sink immediately.""
 In this instance, a directive is being used because a concrete action needs be taken. 
 
  
 commissitive: commissives can be used in two different situations. First, when a request is made for something that is already in possession of another party. Second, they can also be use when asking for a favor. A commissIVE request typically contains a ""would"" verb. ""Would you mind?"" or  ""Would it be possible for you to?"" are examples of commissitives.  
 


 Marketing Manage Office, Can ihelp you?"" is asking a commissative.  The request "" Can  I help  You?""  is too generic, so the response ""Yes, I would mind"" would be a Commissive response

"
2376,"mr green, please.","

It is a request for a reply or response. 
Soup is the topic of conversation. The recipient is expected to offer an opinion on it.

"
2377,"sorry, he's out.","

 commissives are used when the sender is trying to get the receiver to do something, but the message itself does not contain a clear directive. For example, a waiter might say to a customer, ""Would you like a drink?"" but if the customer does nothing, then the waiter is likely to say, “I hope you enjoyed your meal!” A commissIVE is used to indicate that a message is not clear and that neither the server nor thecustomer is sure what to make of the request.

"
2378,what time you suspect back them?,"

Question: ""the text suspect they back within 24 hours.""

In this case, it is a query rather than a statement. This is because a ""question"" is an inquiry that seeks information from another person or entity. In this example, ""they"" are the subject of the question. ""They"" could be a person, a group of people, an animal, etc. Therefore, this is considered a questioning text. 
    
Because the ""suspect"" part of ""within 24"" can be interpreted as a time period, and a period can also be considered as an event, then the sentence can potentially be viewed as asking when the patient suspects that the condition will improve.

"
2379,"sorry, i am not sure, can i take a message?","

the text does provide information, namely names for the plant called weed;
based on this information the dialogue acts out of question (question), directive and commissIVE are possible; 
without knowing the actual label of the prediction, it is not possible to say that it was directive.

"
2380,"no, thanks. i'll call back later.","

This text is asking for a phone number, so it is most likely a directive. However, it could also be a request for information, since the speaker is giving the phone numbers of several people. 
  
If we look at the surrounding text (which is not shown in the snippet above), we see that the first line is a greeting, and the second line mentions that several phone calls have been missed. This text could be asking someone for help, which would make it a commissIVE.

"
2381,that's fine. please call again later.,"

the text starts ""werent you"" which is an inquisitive question;
it is about traffic signals, and the question implies the person asking it does not know the answer; and
based on this context, it seems like the asker is asking someone to explain something.

"
2382,"ok, thank you. goodbye.","

inform: this is a request for information, not a command or a suggestion. 
question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the beginning of a new question
directive: a directive sentence has a verb in the middle of its sentence, and the word order is subject-verb-object
 commissIVE: commissives are used to give orders or suggestions

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue for Dummies"", the following are the possible dialogue acts for this example: 

 
Out of Inform: This is not an example of asking a service question; it's a statement of fact. 
  
Question: It's possible that the person asking needs the space to pack their bags.  This is an open question that invites a response.

"
2383,"so tell me, what's the difference between the board of directors, the ceo, and the stockholders? they all seems ot be the same group of people to me...","

question is used to express uncertainty
inform is a question that is asked to get information
directive is an order to do something
commissive  is used when someone is asking for something to be done for them

A:
According to the book ""Text Analytics: A Practitioner's Guide"" by Michael Stonebraker, there are three types of text: 
1. Text that can have a single meaning
2. Multi-layered text that has multiple meanings
3. Unknown text
In your case, text 1 is applicable.  The text is not ambiguous and can only have one meaning. The board members are politely requesting the CEO to take some action.

"
2384,"no, there's a definite difference. you know, the stockholders are the people who own the company... they're the financial control system. then there's the ceo — the chief executive officer. he's the hot shot, the main guy who is the boss. if there is only one person with absolute power in the organization, everyone knows that the power will go to their head. it's too dangerous. that's the reason for a board of directors. the board is made up of people who are experts in the industry. they could be related to the organization, but more commonly, they are independent and non - biased.","

the text does express gratitude, and it does anticipate a coming event. 
it does ask for information, it doesn't give commands or promises.

"
2385,how many people are on the board of directors?,"

Question is a sub-type ofinform. Question asks a factual question to a person. In this case, a listener is being asked to identify the number of people on a board.

Overinform is used when a speaker gives more information than is necessary to accomplish the task at hand. For example, if a host were to give a long-winded description of a museum exhibit, they would be over-informing. 
In this example the host is overinformatio because they are giving too much information about the museum. The museum description is too long and may distract from the main purpose of the meeting, which is to discuss the company's financials. 
  
  Inform is the default dialogue action for a statement. This is because inform is considered the most neutral dialogue response. It is not considered to be a directive or a commisssive response and is therefore the expected response for any statement made by a human.

  Question and overinform are sub types of question. Therefore, this is another example of when question is expected.  The host was giving more detailed information then necessary and was therefore overquestioning. 

  Directive is also considered a neutral response however it is often used in a command or request role. When a direct object is mentioned in the sentence, it becomes the direct subject of that action. So in this sentence the director is asking for their number, therefore making this a commisssory response
