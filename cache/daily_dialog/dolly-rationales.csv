,Explanation
0,"Question: ""you wannabuy someweed?""
Overinform: No, I don't want to buy weed. 
Quiet: Ok, thanks.

"
1,"In this example, ""How much it is?"" indicates that the asker is looking for an estimate or an approximation. 
  
  This is a typical question that a person will ask when they are looking to make a decision or choose an option.

"
2,"This text provides information, so it should have been marked as such. The only thing that could classify it as a query is the ""werent you..."" at the beginning, since that implies the question is about the listener's knowledge or belief. However, this is unlikely, given that this question was asked to a person who was present at that event. 
  
However, it could also be classified under the inform category, because it provides details of an item that was cooked. This is an informational text.

"
3,"the text is requesting a response (question)
it is giving information (inform) about an individual (the person mentioned in this paragraph) 
there is no explicit indication that the information is being shared for the purpose of providing general information rather than for a specific individual or purpose (e.g., the statement ""i will Graduate from Peking University this July"" is not indicating that Dunlin will be graduating from the Peaking University in July). 
  

In summary, based on this passage, we can classify the following as a commissIVE response:
""No, thanks.""
This is because the response is providing negative feedback to a request for information. The response conveys a negative sentiment, such as ""No thanks"", ""I don't want that"", or ""That's not cool"". 
   
However, a dialogue act classification of commissives is only one piece of the larger conversation analysis puzzle. In order to provide a complete analysis of your text and its context, you will need to consider the other elements of conversation, including the speaker, topic, dialogue structure, tone of voice, pauses, word choice, sentence structure and punctuation.

"
4,"""i haveblow"" is a statement that does express a preference, but it is not a request. ""prefer to"" implies a choice, and ""do afew lines"" does imply a limit. Therefore, ""ihaveblowif youpreferto doafewlines"" would be a valid request, though uncommon.

"
5,"This text is asking a direct question about whether the listener is ok. This is a commissIVE dialogueact, as it seeks to question the other person's state of mind, typically to get them to do something. 
However, this is also an informational text. The listener's response would be ""yes, you are ok"" and the dialogue would end there. In this case, it would not be considered a Commissive dialogue, but rather an Informational one.

"
6,"the text indicates that the dopper has some dopex and the acid man should try it. The doppler is suggesting that if the listener has the resources to procure the drugs, then they should do so. In this way, it attempts to influence the decision of the addressee to try the drug.

"
7,"This text can also be classified under the question dialogue acts. 'Where do  you get these from?' is a typical question that is used to seek clarification from the listener. 
  
'Where can I get all these illegal drugs?' would be a more typical example of an ask question type of dialogue.

"
8,"This text indicates the potential for a direct order or request. The speaker indicates they will give the requested amount of one gram of cocaine for oneounce of money, without requiring any further explanation or justification. 
  
  The text also indicates a potential future order, in which the sender may request the receiver to purchase wind energy as a means of reducing reliance on fossil fuel sources.

"
9,"In the given example, there is a lack of personal information shared between the two speakers. The only thing the first speaker says is'i', which is not a typical way to share personal preferences. 
Furthermore, this is followed immediately by an instruction to do something, suggesting that the preference is more of an order or a request. 
  This is also why the second speaker’s response is marked as directive. It is clear that they are trying  to direct the listener towards an action, but the order of their words does not make it clear which action is being suggested.

"
10,"Question is the most likely dialogueact given the context of ""yep, I know"", ""but what abou..."", ""...the...chicken..."" and ""it?"". 
Inform is unlikely given that ""question"" is asked for. 
  
Directive is also unlikely, as ""do it"" does  not ask for a command, it asks for an action.

"
11,"A directive dialogueact is used when the sender wants the receiver to take an action. In this case, John is suggesting that we should allow 3 hours for the car to travel the specified distance. 
  
  The text does not seek information, it does seek agreement. The recipient is being asked to share his or her opinion on whether we will allow the 3 hour time period to pass or not. If the answer is no, then the directive act applies and the police will be called.

"
12,"In the beginning of text (""the beginning""), the taxi driver says ""it does"". This suggests they have some knowledge of whether or not the cab drivers will be on a strike in the near future. 
  
Later in text (after the inform clause), the same taxi-driver says, ""That's why it's called 'it is'"". The taxi cab driver is explaining that ""It does"", which they used at the start of their sentence, is in fact called "" It is"". 
   
Finally, at end of sentence (""that’s why""), they confirm that their knowledge was correct, that is, they were correct in their explanation of "" it"". They were also over-predicting a confirmative dialogueact, as they also said "" that’'s called It Is"" at that point.

"
13,"Question: I don’t think it’s a great idea for Mike to leave the house again, as I really want to get ready for my move home and I need him to help me pack. 
  Based On The Text: Mike, I think you should stay at home until you are ready  to leave again to ensure that you can focus fully on preparing for your move. I know that this is a difficult time for you, so I’m not trying to be a burden, just trying my best to keep you safe and focused. Please let me know if you still want me to stay home with you.  

In this example, it is clear that Mike is being questioned by his friend about whether or not he should leave to prepare for his move to his new home, indicating that he is making an instruction to Mike (i.e. “Please don‘t leave”). The question mark at the end of the sentence indicates uncertainty, suggesting that there is more to the conversation than what is presented here.

"
14,"In this example, it appears that ""they"" want ""the government"" to lower the gas price. However, this is not a direct question. ""They"" are not asking ""do you want them to?"" or ""are you going to do it?"". Instead, they are sharing what they learned from someone, so it could be classified under inform.

"
15,"the text provides information on both parties' states, but only asks a single question about one of the parties;
this text could be classified under question if the dialogue acts of both the participants were known; however, since the act for one party is not known, it has to be inform.

"
16,"""we’ve managed"" is an action statement, and the rest of the sentence is describing the result of that action. This is therefore a factual statement. 
15% is not a large amount of reduction, but it's not an exaggeration either. 
"
17,"This text contains a ""question"" (i.e., a declarative statement that can also be understood as a request for confirmation) that is not followed by a response. This is because there is a missing ""response"" in this case, which is the confirmation that Dunlin is indeed a person and that she will be graduating from Peking University this July.

"
18,"We've not invested into a HRS, but we are trying to reduce our carbon footprint. 
This text could be seen as offering information about the HRT system, such as how it works or how to operate it.

"
19,"Question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the author is looking for additional information or clarification. 
Overinform: this is the most common type of question in English, where the information provided is too much for the listener. In this case, ""are"" is being used as the auxiliary verb, and the answer is ""no"" (which is not very informative). 

 

Information: ""that"" refers to the previous sentence, in which the driver was asked about their driving habits. The question is then seeking more specific information about the meaning of ""driving through red lights"".

"
20,"In this example, ""a"" is the subject of the sentence, so the dialogue acts are predicted as follows:

inform: ""people from europe to asian enjoy teat""
overinform ""asian to enjoy europe people"" 
question: is there a subject?
no question is asked here
directive: provide instructions on how to proceed
there is a command being issued here, but it is not a direct one
commissive ""all enjoy"" indicates a general preference
all is an adjective describing a group of people, not the people themselves
comissives are used to express a choice or preference, rather than a requirement
the text is expressing general information, therefore the predict a inform dialogue action
information: the information provided is about a specific group, namely people in europe and asians, who enjoy each other's company
therefore the inform action is predicted
in this sentence ""printing exhausts"" does NOT provide any energy, it merely describes the process of using energy.

"
21,"In this example, ""can I get your pictures Tomorrow?"" the question mark indicates that the information provided is not enough to make an informed decision. In this particular case, getting the pictures is something the person wants to do, but they don't know if they can do it tomorrow or if it will require more time. Therefore, it can also be interpreted as asking a direct question: ""Can I have your photos tomorrow?"". 
  
""here are the films. Can I got my photos Tomorrow"" is another example of asking for a photo. As the photo is an important part of the message, asking to get a copy of it implies that you need it to understand the content of what was said.

"
22,"Inform is the most common dialogue acts in this example. It is used when the information provided is not important or relevant to the current context. For example, when a person is asked about their hobbies, inform is appropriate. However, if the person were asked if they had a hobby of collecting baseball cards, then question would be more appropriate as the question is important and relevant. 
  
Overinform is also used in similar situations. Inform can be used too much, overinform means the opposite. 
Question is another common act in dialogues. When the context is unclear, a dialogue asker may ask for clarification. If the askee does not provide the clarification, ask again. Otherwise, promise or command may be added to clarify the request.

"
23,"In this example, we can see that this is a text about tea. We can also see the use the verb ""like"" to describe the preference of the drinker. Based on this, I would classify this as aninform dialogueact. 
  
  The text also contains the word ""anything"" which is used to seek information. In this case, ""want"" is likely being used as a verb, and is being interpreted as ""to want to"". This indicates a request for information, rather than a statement of fact. 
Finally, there is also the ""oh"" word at end of sentence which can be used in questions to look for answers. Here, this indicates the question is seeking information and not a fact or statement.

"
24,"Inform is a dialogueact that can appear in response or as the main dialogue acts. In this example, inform is used as one of the dialogue Acts. 
  
  In inform the given information is about a preference, decision or availability. This is what the information can mean in the context of a conversation.

"
25,"In China, tea is a national food. It is also a beverage that is very popular. Therefore, when someone asks ""How much tea?"" it is likely that they are curious about how much of a particular tea variety is actually consumed in China.

"
26,"Inform is an act that provides information to a listener. In this case, it's offering information that Chinese people claim love tea, and if the receiver accepts the information, then the two parties will proceed to have a conversation. 
  
Question is act where the sender is seeking information from a receiver. The question here is 'do you love Chinese tea?'. If the answer is yes, than the conversation continues. Otherwise, there is no conversation and the question is rejected.  

"
27,"Question dialogue acts are used to seek information from another person, and are often used in a conversation to test whether the listener understands something. In this example, 'tea' is a topic that is not commonly known by the reader, so the question is asking the author to share information so that they can be informed. 
  
Overinform dialogue Acts are similar to questions, but they are too broad and do not provide enough information to answer the main question. For example: ""What is the weather like today?"" is an overinform act, as the answer is clearly not ""raining"" or ""snowing"". 
   
Directive dialogue Act is used when the sender wants the receiver to take an action. The receiver should ""allow three (3) hours"" to ""cover the distace"" in this case. Directive acts can also be used as a request for clarification, for example ""Can you repeat that?"".

"
28,"Question: ""any others?"" is an open-ended question that invites the answer ""other green tea, other black tea or other scentsed tea"". The recipient is expected to share their knowledge of other types of teabags. 
In contrast, ""there is green, there is black and there's scENTSED"" is not an invitation for an explanation. The answer is provided in the form of a fact.

"
29,"Question: ""Have you heard oolong and Compressed tea?""
Overinform: No, I have not. 
Questions: Have you had ooolong or compressed teas? 

 

Compressed Tea: Yes, that's right. I've had compressed Tea. 
  
OolONG Tea : No I haven't.

"
30,"overinform: the given piece or piece is not information that can be used to answer the question
question: I'm asking why oolong is healthy

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Stalnaker, there are four basic types of acts in conversation: question; directive; request; and command.  The text you provided is a good example of a request.

"
31,"Over-prediction is a common problem in natural language understanding (NLU) systems. In this case, our model predicts that this is an informational text and not a request for help. However, this type text does contain a command, request, promise and question. We believe that our system is over-predicting the command and request dialogue acts because the model is not explicitly told that these are commands and requests.

"
32,"Inform is used when someone is giving information to another person. The speaker is providing facts or details about tea-drinking, and the listener is taking in the information. 
  
Question is when one person is seeking information or clarification from another. Both people are asking questions, though the questioner is typically seeking answers from a more knowledgeable person than they. 
Directive is for when a person or persons are being instructed or told to carry out an act. In this case, it's likely the server is being told what to order or do. Commissive, on occasion, is also used for this type of directive act, when the directive is made to a group.

"
33,"Inform (in, over, inform) indicates the dialogue acts are used in a situation when the information is not needed or not relevant. Inform acts include tell, tell all, show, don't tell. Question (question, ask, want to know, wonder), command (tell, do this, stop doing that), and promise (promise, promise soon, will do soon) are all examples of directive acts. 
  Question and command are often used as a form of questioning or command when there is no inform or directive act present. Commissive acts (suggest, suggest something) indicate a suggestion or recommendation is being made.

"
34,"""that’s excellent"" is an over-generalization, so the statement is not a directive. 
the text does not ask for a specific action, but rather expresses a general opinion. Therefore, this statement falls into the over category of ""that is excellent"".

A:
According to the GPT-2 model, ""question"" and ""directive"" are the most likely dialogue acts for this sample.

"
35," commissives are often offering advice or guidance to their interlocutor. In this case, it seems that this speaker wants to help the other person by giving them advice on how to eat healthily. 
  
outliners are generally interested in finding common ground between the two parties. The speaker and the listener might have similar interests, so they might be able to have a conversation about this topic. 
question askers want to know something from their conversation partner. For example, if the interlocutors are strangers, they may want the asker to introduce themselves. If they already know each other, then the question may be about something personal that has come up in the conversation.

"
36," commissives are typically used when someone is making an offer or a promise. In this case, it is likely that the person asking for a phone is going to be making some sort of reservation, and the offer of the phone would be a prerequisite for making the reservation. However, in this context, since the request is for their own phone, not for some service or product, this is classified commissively.

"
37,"Question dialogue Acts are used to:

Ask a direct question to get a response from the person being talked to. 
Request information, directions, opinions, etc. from another person. 
  
In this case, 'what is your weakness?' is considered a 'question' dialogue action because the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates that there is going to be a follow-up question. The question is 'What is yours?'. This is followed by the word 'weakness', which could be the topic of a subsequent question or a comment.

"
38,"Inform is the most common dialogue acts in this context. The speaker expresses their lack of comfort in talking to strangers, but also wants to improve their publicspeaking skills. They are not asking for help or assistance, they are simply expressing their current state. 
  
Out ofinform is used when the information provided is out of the ordinary or unexpected. In this case, it seems that i am not the only one who feels this way, because the second recipient ofthe text also feels uncomfortable talking about her business with strangers. However, she does not ask for assistance or help, instead she is simply sharing her feelings. 
Question is another common dialogical act in the context of public Speaking. It is only used in rare cases, when a speaker wants the listener to ask a specific question about a topic. For example, if a teacher asks a student a simple question like ""Who wrote Shakespeare's plays?"", then the student is expected to raise their hand and ask the teacher the question ""who wrote shakespeare's works?""
Directive is an uncommon dialogueact in publicSpeaking. When used, a directive dialogueAct is usually used to give instructions to another person or to a group of people. Here, i want to tell you something important, that you should know. I will explain it to you in more detail later.

"
39,"Leader: ""Are you a  leader or  a follower?""
Follower (response): ""I'm more  of a co-operator, I don't like to  lead,  I'd rather work with  others, we all do a good job together if we work together.""

A:
According to your explanation, leader is asking follower, because follower is not following the leader's style.

"
40,"In this example, ""i'd rather work together"" is a preference of mine, which is why I prefer the dialogue acts of ""cooperate"" and ""work together"".

"
41,"Question: the first part of the question is not clearly asking about anything. It is just a general statement about how to make oneself understood. 
Overinform: this is a very general question that does not provide enough information to answer the given question
No information is shared. The person asking the questions does nothing to provide any information. 
  The person answering the general questions is expected to share some information about making oneself understandable in English. However, this part is too general and does little to help the asker understand English

Directive:  the second part asks for a strategy or explanation about following a certain set foods.  This part indicates a request for advice or information and is therefore a direct question 
   The askers are looking for some advice on how they can stick with a particular set food. They are seeking advice and information from the one giving it.

"
42,"Inform is used to provide information to another person without asking a direct question. This is because the information is already known or understood by the receiver. 
  
Question is a type of dialogue action used when one person asks a questions to which another needs to give an answer. In this type, there is an element of uncertainty or a lack of information. The receiver of question is expected to seek further information from the questioner.  This is also known as a interrogative sentence.   
Directive is another type dialogue actions used in a conversation when the speaker wants the listener to take an action. For example, a person might say 'Call your mom.' The listener is supposed to call their mom. Commisitive is when a speaker asks another to do something for them, such as 'Would you call your mother for me?'. 
Promise is the type action of a dialogue when someone makes a statement that they will do or perform something.

"
43,"Question dialogue acts are used to seek information from the listener, to pose questions, and to request opinions or advice. In this case, based on what the first person said, ""sure,"" the question is posed to the second person to confirm that they are available to travel at a given time. 
  
Directive dialogue Acts are often used when one person takes an active role in guiding or directing the activities of another person. Here, given that both the people are asking the same person for their availability to go on a trip, one can interpret the given directive as ""you should go"" or ""it is time for you to  go."" 
   
Commissive or cooperative dialogue Act is used in situations where one or more people agree to do something or take an affirmative action. Given that ""Sure, let's go now,"" both people may agree and go together.

"
44,"'yes' is an affirmative answer, so the inform act should be applied. However, 'i like' and 'it ’s no trouble for' are both affirmative statements, making the over-application of theinform act unlikely. 
  
In addition, although the statement is about travelling, it does not ask any questions or give any commands. Therefore, this is also unlikely to be an inform statement.

"
45,"This text is asking a direct question to its recipient (how much time does it will take to travel to London). The question is not seeking confirmation or a reply, but rather is a simple inquiry. 
  

text: how long it'll take you to get to laondon
based on text: will takes us about 6 hours
predicted dialogue acts: question
why question: the question appears as an inquiry, and is therefore classified in this category.

"
46,"In this example, we see that the dialogue acts are over-classified. The first sentence of text indicates that it would take two hours to drive from where the speakers are to London. However, given that they are in a car, they could drive much faster. So, in this case, there is no clear indication of a request for action. In fact, this sentence could be interpreted as a friendly suggestion to travel at faster speeds. 
  
Similarly, although the second sentence indicates the location of where they would eat while in the cup, again, since they can drive there, their suggestion is not a direct order to eat there.

"
47,"Out ofinform: the dialogue acts question and directive are not present in this passage. 
Overinform : the passage contains information that could be considered a request for information, an order, a recommendation,  or a suggestion.

"
48,"the text indicates the speakers preferences and desires by using the word 'want'
this is an example of providing the information that we mentioned earlier, that high speed travel is possible in the built up area at beginning or end.

"
49,"Directive dialogue acts are used to request a specific action or behavior from the listener. In this example, ""shall we"" is a request for the participants to take action. 
  
Overinform dialogue Acts are overuse of dialogueacts. This text uses inform and question dialogueact repeatedly. It is better to use question or directive dialogueAct instead.

"
50,"Question is the most likely dialogue action in this context, because the question mark is used in the first person, and it appears that the person asking is not familiar with the company. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Staloff, there are 4 possible dialogue acts: 
1. Information: ""I want to know what you think of my new car.""
2. Recommendation:  ""I think you'll like this car.  Would you like to try it out?""
3. Directive:   ""You should wear a seat belt.""  ""Do as I say, not as you do.""    ""Turn off the engine."" ""Stop the car!""
4. Commissive : ""You have been a bad boy.""   “You will do as told.”  “You are dismissed.”
In this example, ""hi mrs sandal. I'm michael. When do u need room?"" the information dialogue is commissIVE.  

""Hi Mrs. Sandal. It's nice to meet you. Do you know when you might need a room? I have a spare room if you ever need one.""

"
51,"Inform is used when providing information to a listener. The speaker in this example is providing the length of the road in order to provide the driver with information regarding the distance. 
  
Question is only used in certain circumstances, when the information provided is not enough to make a decision. In this case, since the answer is needed to understand the context of what is being discussed, a Question is appropriate.  The question is ""why is it longer?"". This is an inquiry, and indicates the need for more information. 
Directive is typically used to request a change in behavior from the other person. Since the question requires a response from another person, this is the most appropriate dialogue action. ""Let me look at it and get back to you.""
Commissive can be used if the action being requested is against the will of that person or is outside of their control. Here, asking the car length is contrary to the drivers intention to return the favor. They would not want to give you the exact length, so they ask you to let them borrow your car for a while. So, Commissive would be the appropriate response. Let me borrow yours for just a bit.

"
52,"In this passage, we can see that ""it"" is being referred to. Based on this, it can inferred that this is a plural pronoun and it is referring to flowers. Therefore, ""its"" can also be classified under directive as the action is for someone or something else.

"
53,"""they’re only 20 dollars a twelve"" is an informative piece or fact, not a request for a response. 
the text ""how much it will take to travel to Londont"" can be classified either as a factual piece, a directive or commissIVE, but not as question or over directive. 
                                                                       
                  
                  

"
54,"We can’t break a speedlimit, because that would be breaking the law. We can, however, go that slow. 
  The text uses the word ‘would’ to indicate that the answer is likely to change the meaning of what is being asked. The answer would indicate we could go faster, but we can also go slower. However, if the person answering says ‘we could not’, then the act would become commissIVE (which is an act that prohibits something). 
      If the response is ‘yes, you could’, the action would likely be to slow down, and the resulting act (if the question is answered negatively) would probably be question or directive. If the reply is no, then it would most likely become a commissitive act, where the directive is to stop.

"
55,"In the given context, ""on my Driving Test"" is an open-ended question that is not seeking a specific answer. Therefore, it does not fit into the category of question or question-asking. 
  
However, based on its structure, this question appears as if it were seeking additional clarification, so it could be classified under the question category.

"
56,"""yes"" is a response to a yes/no question. The question mark indicates a request for more information. 
the sale is the item's current price. 
  

This text is not asking for a specific action, but rather sharing information that may be relevant to the receiver. As such, it is classified here as ""question"" rather ""directive"" or ""commissive"".

"
57,"Inform is a directive dialogue acts that provide information to another person. Inform acts are often used when someone is trying to convince another of a point or when they are giving information that is not meant for public consumption. 
  
Question is another directive act that asks a follow up question. Question acts can be used to clarify information or to seek clarification on a topic. They can also be a way to test the validity of information provided.

"
58,"I would have expected the prediction to have been incorrect, since the message is clearly asking for advice. In addition, it's not clear from this message that you actually did anything wrong.

"
59,"Question: the dialogue acts question and question are similar, but they have different answers. Question asks a yes/no question. The correct answer is yes. 
Overinform: this is a type of question that asks for too much information. Inform provides only a few pieces of necessary information, while question asks the user for more details. 
  Question : I asked for your number, not your address.  
  Overquestion: I provided too many details, I should have provided only your name.

"
60,"In the given context, a leadership evaluation is being conducted. The question is therefore seeking an honest answer. 
  
You could argue that the question could also be interpreted as a request for a recommendation, and therefore the dialogue acts of request and recommendation would have to be considered as well. However, in this case, I would argue the answer should be'more of an inform than a directive'.

"
61,"the text asks a person to share whether they are more a lead or follow. 
this requires a response from that person. 
  
therefore, it's a 'question'

A:
According to this website, there are 4 possible answers for a ""question"" dialogue tag: question(out), question?, question on, and question off.  The website also provides an example of each.

"
62,"Inform is a generic dialogue action that can be used for a variety of purposes. For example, it can describe a person providing general information or sharing factual information without requiring further context. In this example the inform action is used to describe the plans of the person. 
  
Overinform is another example of a general dialogue  action. This action can occur when a conversation is going well and the participants are sharing a lot of information and details. However, if the conversation does not go as well, this action could be misinterpreted as the participant is trying to share too much information which could lead to a misunderstanding.

"
63,"Inform acts are used to provide information without asking for it. For example, ""I'm fine"" is aninform act, as it conveys that information to the listener without the need for a request. 
Question acts seek information from the other person. The question ""How are YOU?"" is seeking information, and is therefore a Question act
Directive acts guide the behavior of the person speaking. In this case, it is the response ""Understand"" that guides the choice of ""What were THEY?""

"
64,"In this example, there is no indication that this is a command or offer of an action. The only indication is that there are a series of statements that are not questions, directives, offers, requests, apologies, etc. 
There is also no mention of any action that needs to taken by the reader.

"
65,"Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and directive are similar in that both are asking the question or giving the instruction. However, inform is more general, meaning it can be used to describe any type or form of information sharing, whereas directive is specific to asking or instructing someone to do something. 
Question: question is another similar dialogue action to inform or directive. Whereas directive asks or tells someone what to or to where to, questions are about asking someone for information or clarification. In this case, there is a lack of any indication that this is an instruction or a request, so question should be the correct classification. 
  
Directive: directive indicates a clear command to someone. This text clearly gives an order or direction to find a type specific clothing. Therefore, it is classified under directive
Commissive (also known as request): commissives are used when a person is making an offer or promise. Here, this type is used for when someone is offering an explanation or providing additional information. Because the explanation is offered to clarify something, rather than make a statement, request should not be applied.

"
66,"Inform (93.33%)
Overinform (6.67%)

"
67,"Inform is used when someone is giving information to another person. 
Question is a way to ask a clarifying question to someone. It is not used to seek information. For example, ""How did you do?"" is an example of question used in a non-interrogative context. 
  
Directive is when a person gives instructions to do something. In this case, it's likely that ""i"" is directing ""you"" to get ready for your driving exam.  Directives are not usually used for seeking information, so this is classified here.

"
68,"'I’m afraid I’M a Poor Talker.' - The first sentence of the message indicates the sender is afraid of their communication skills. 
'that is very bad for Business, So I Have Been Studing Public Speaking.'  - The second sentence indicates how the lack communication ability is bad from a business perspective. 
  

I hope this helps!

"
69,"the text does ask an open-ended question about how the conversation got going, but the answer is straightforward and does provide further context. 
it is giving an order or a directive. 
  The speaker wants the listener to do something, and they are giving a specific instruction or order. For example, ""go get me a coffee"" or ""stop the car at the red light."" 
 the context of the dialogue is asking for advice or guidance. The speaker may be seeking advice from a friend or colleague.

"
70,"Inform is a prediction of a dialogue acts based on a conversation context. In this case, yesterday I had runnynose is the conversationcontext. Based on this context, inform predicts that yesterday the person speaking was seeking or giving information, asking or asking questions, or directing or requesting instructions. The actual dialogueact that was performed yesterday is not revealed in this response.

"
71,"Directives are used when the speaker is giving orders or instructions to another person or thing. In this case, it's telling the young person to open his mouth. 
Inform is used for when you are asking someone or something about their health. This is not the case here, since the directive is telling him to do so. 
  
Question is the most common dialogue-act classification for information seeking. When you don't know something, you ask. So, in this example, when he says 'what' the boy is asking him what he is going to examine him for.

"
72,"the text does ask questions, such as ""how many pairs of sandles do you have?"". 
it is also a directive text. The speaker wants the recipient to do something, in this case, provide his phone. 
  
However, it does contain some information, as the sandle reservation details are shared.

"
73,"Because the statement is sharing information and does NOT ask any questions, make any commands or promises, an inform dialogue action is most likely. 
  
Your throat feels sore and you notice that your mouth is coated with a film of dried saliva. These are symptoms commonly associated with the flu.

"
74,"Question is the most likely dialogueact, as the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates. The sentence is a request for information, so it’s likely that this is what the person is currently asking. However, it could also be a comment on how the request is being made, and the tone of voice used in the last sentence (“we never go fast”) suggests that there is some doubt about the validity of what is happening.

"
75,"Directive is an action or behavior that is meant to be followed or done. In this case, prescription writing is the directive. 
Inform is used to describe someone providing general information. The speaker in this example is not providing any information but is instead providing a general statement. This is because they are giving you the information that you will need to know to make good decisions for your health. 
  
Question is another action that seeks information from the other person. Here, asking what the meaning of the statement is is what is being asked for.

"
76,"Inform is a polite way of asking a question. The inform dialogue acts are used when the question is about information that is already known to the other person. For example, if a person asks another person, 'Where is the nearest pharmacy?' the inform act would be used. 
  
Question is another polite word for inquiry. When used in a conversation, a Question dialogueact is used to seek information from another. A Question can be answered with another Question, but a Dialogueact can also be a Commissive act, which means that a participant can ask another to do something. An example of a direct Question is 'Do you want to go to a movie tonight?'.

"
77,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask a direct question to another person. The question mark at the end of a sentence indicates the start of the question. For example, ""What's the time?"". 
In this example the person asking the direct and declarative question is ""the speaker"" (my). The person being asked the indirect question (""the addressee"") is the ""addresSee"" which can also be inferred from the use of ""you"" in the sentence. 
  
Over-prediction of question dialogue Acts: ""what's"" is a preposition, not a conjunction. Therefore, this question can't be classified under the conjunction dialogue Act category. However, since the word ""is"" immediately follows the prepositions ""for"" and "" supper"", the NLP model classified this as the dialogue question act ""question"". 
   
Under- prediction of direct questions: the model under- predicted question acts for the following reasons:
1. ""supper"" can function as both a noun and a verb.  Noun supper can refer to the meal that is being discussed. Verb supper is used in questions to refer back to something that was previously discussed in order to make sure that everyone is on board with what is to be done. In this case, supper refers to ""a meal""
2. the verb ""develop"" could be a transitive verb, and it can mean ""to make something new or different by changing or improving its form or qualities"". In the context of developing a film roll,  develop could also mean to change the film into a new roll.


3. Although the phrase ""courteous"" does appear in this sentence, there is no context in which it could function in that way. A polite response to an inquiry is courteously phrased. So, although the response is polite, in context it would be more of  a confirmation than a request. 


4. Finally, despite the fact that ""sure"" appears in parentheses at end the entire sentence as if it were a parenthetical aside, its function is not to provide additional information. Rather, sure is an adverb that conveives certainty or assurance. Since the rest of what follows is declaratives, including the main question word, surely, that makes sure the most important word in an affirmative response. Thus, clearly, courtois, polite answer, is what best fits this context. Please note that this answer is based on a machine learning model and is purely conjectural. I encourage you to validate this analysis with a human. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you!

  

"
78,"Inform is the best choice for dialogue acts for statements that provide information, such as the one above. The statement provides information regarding a misunderstanding or error that may have occurred, and the author is sharing this information to their conversation partners. 
  
Question is a poor choice because the statement does not contain a request for information. Rather, it suggests an action that both parties can take. Therefore, there is no need to ask a follow-up question. 
Directive is also a bad choice, because it does indicate a direction for action, but it also indicates that one person is taking an active role in the action. In this case, this is clearly the listener, since they are the person who made the mistake. However, in many other cases, a person may be taking a passive role, for example, if the information is being shared by a manager to a subordinate. A directive is therefore not appropriate in this situation. Commissive would also be a good choice here, although it implies a sense of obligation or a duty to the other person. Since the error has already been acknowledged, they should share this with the conversational partner, so a commissitive response is appropriate.

"
79,"Question dialogue acts are used to seek clarification or to request additional information from the listener. The question dialogueact is used in the following situations:
- When the information provided is not sufficient to understand the context of the message. 
For example, ""What time is the movie starting?"" requires more information than just ""the movie is starting at 8 pm.""

In this example ""what time"" is information that is necessary to answer the question. However, if the answer to this question is provided in ""The movie starts at eight pm"" then the dialogue is considered to be question because the additional piece of information is needed to fully understand what is being asked. 
  
When the asker is looking for a specific answer from a listener, but does want to provide context or information about why they are asking. For example: ""I was thinking about going to that new restaurant on Main Street, and I was just wondering what your thoughts were on it?""
  In the example above, it is clear that ""your thoughts"" are being requested because ""why"" the restaurant is mentioned is missing.


However, when the request for information comes from someone the asks a direct question of another, then it becomes a query. Queries are often used when two people are communicating with each other, yet do not know each others' names. A query dialogue-act can also be used by a person who is communicating to another person, to ask that person a favor. In this case, a third party is involved, so the third person is typically not named. This is because a name is often a prerequisite for asking someone a favour. If the name of that third-party person was known, that would be a pre-requisite for requesting that favour:

  ""Would you be willing to help me out with this favor?""

 When a dialogue dialogue action is classified in this way, you can see that it has a ""question"" in its header, however it actually falls into the ""inform"" category. ""Sure"" falls under the inform category because when you say ""sure"" you are confirming something that has already been said. You are not asking for more clarification, nor are you making a commitment or promise, just an affirmative statement. So, in summary, this is an example of an ""informed question""

"
80,"Inform is a non-directive, noncommissive dialogueact, as it conveys no information about the nature or purpose of a communication. It is typically used when the speaker is providing background or context to a message, but does not wish to make a commitment or offer a guarantee. 
  
Question is an inquiry dialogue-act. A question is usually initiated by the questioner, who is looking for an answer or response from another person. They are typically seeking information, clarification, confirmation of facts, etc.

"
81,"Question is a way of expressing curiosity or seeking information. The question in this example is about a condiments, and the answer would provide more details about it. 
  
Out ofinform is used when you are not providing information, but instead giving advice or making a suggestion. In this case, it is likely that Mr. Sandals is giving some advice about where to have lunch.

"
82,"Inform is used to share information or facts. The predicted text is not a direct question or request, so inform is the most likely dialogueact. 
Question is one of four possible dialogue acts, used when someone is asking a specific question. This text does ask one specific, but not necessarily direct,  question: ""can I use this?"". Therefore, this is classified under question rather than inform
Directive is another of dialogue Acts, that can be used in place of another dialogueAct when it is necessary to communicate a person's order to another person. In this case, there is no question and the order is clear from the context. So, using directive is appropriate. 
 Commisitive is also one possible category of a dialogue Act, where the person using it expects a response from another.  In this example, ""hold it"" is expected as a reply from someone else. Using commissitive in this context is therefore appropriate
Out of these four options, inform and question are subcategories of each other, with question being the more specific.

"
83,"Question is a way of expressing curiosity or a desire to learn more. In this example, it seems that a person is asking the person helping them to help them. This is because they are expressing a curiosity about how to use a fork, a tool that is not commonly used by the speakers. They are also asking for help, as they express a need for someone to assist them in using a new tool.

"
84,"""no"" is a negative command that can be used to stop a person from doing something. 
Don't is another negative instruction that is used in place of a verb. 
  So the command ""no don’t"" can replace the verb ""do"" in the sentence ""Don’ts of doing your homework: Don’twrite your name on your assignment, Don't turn your work in late and Don""t skip any questions"". 
 Commands are always followed by a subjunctive form of the main verb, so the subjonctive form ""don't"" of ""dont"" has to be added to the end of sentences.

"
85,"In this example, ""thanks"" is used to express gratitude. 
""i"" indicates the speaker is the one making the response. 
  ""can"" and  ""-"" indicate that ""watch TV"" can be done.

"
86,"Outlets are insufficient is a warning, not a query. It is not asking if the listener would be interested in going out. Rather, by providing a list of potential outlets and then stating that there aren't enough of them, this is an indication that some of the suggested outlets may not be feasible. 
To make this a proper query, Kara would need to ask ""why are there not more outlets?"". This would require a more complex understanding of politesse, and would likely be classified in the question dialogue acts.

"
87,"This text indicates the receiver should perform the action requested. 
It also indicates a lack of gratitude or appreciation from this speaker, who instead seems to want something in return for the requested action (i.e., ""that is veryKind of You. Thank You"").

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue for English Language Learners"" by John H. Harrington, there are 4 possible dialogue acts for a given sentence: question/request, command, request, and answer.  The answer act can be further broken down into two sub-acts: answer-in-question and direct answer (which is the same as answer).  
In your example, ""do yuo want th truth?"" the answer answer can only be in the form of a direct response.

"
88,"In the example above, ""soup"" is a topic of conversation, so the dialogue acts are classified using the ""topic of the conversation"" as a base. In this case, since the topic is soup and the other options are ""peppermint"" and ""chicken noodle,"" the classification is overinform, over question, over directive, and over commissives.

"
89,"Question: ""How are You?""
Answer: I am fine, thank you for asking. 
  Based On The Text:  ""how are  you?"" I would interpret this as a simple question asking how Mike is doing.  It does  not ask for clarification or information, it is a  simple statement of fact.

"
90,"Question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the
  speaker is looking for clarification or an explanation. 
  Inform: inform is the default dialogue action for this type of text. It indicates a request for information without any indication of influence or guidance. The question is therefore asking a clarifying question and the response should be informative. 
Directive: directive is used when the conversation is being directed or guided in a particular direction. In this case, it would indicate that you were asking the person a follow-up question to a previous question they asked you. For example, you might say ""are you allergic to shellfish?"" and they might respond with ""yes, I'm allergic"" and you would say to them ""have you ever eaten a shrimp?"". Directive is a good response in this situation because it indicates you are asking them a new question that is related to their previous answer. However, in the example above, this response would be too directive as you want to encourage them to continue eating shell-fish. Commissive would also be used in situations like this, where the directive response is too strong. Here, CommissIVE would mean that ""I'm asking this question because I care about your health and want you to be safe"". In the previous example this would imply that they are not allergic, but instead that I want them not to eat shell fish because they don't want their friends to die of food poisoning. So, while directive would fit in that situation, here commissIVE is more appropriate.

"
91,"""things"" are ""going well"" with the author could be seen as an expression of positive emotion, so the dialogue acts of both ""things going"" and ""well"" could fall under inform. 
the author is seeking clarification from the reader about whether or not they agree with this sentiment, with their question mark.

"
92,"This text indicates the desire of a sender to have a second date with kara. 
It is a polite way of asking kath if she would be interested in going out with him again. 
  

I had Fun the Other Night at The Movies:
Yes, I would love to see you again on fridays.

"
93,"Mike is giving the impression that he is asking for help by explaining that his situation makes it difficult for him to travel. However, this is only his impression, so it would be helpful to know whether Mike is actually asking to help him. If Mike does not want to ask for any help, then it might be better to explain that Mike's situation is beyond your control and that you cannot help with his travel plans.

"
94,"This text indicates the desire to meet up with the person asking for weed, and the sender is giving instructions or suggestions on how to do so.

"
95,"Inform is a polite dialogueact, meaning it is used when the speaker is providing information to thelistener. The inform dialogue acts are: overinform, onquestion, upondirective, and upon commissives. 
  
Question is the most common dialogueAct in this context. It is an inquiry dialogue Act used to seek information from another person. There are four types of question: declarative, interrogative (also known as interrogation), hypothetical, or optative. A declaratively question asks for information, such as ""what time is it?"". An interrogatively questions asks a person to explain something to us, like ""why is this car so slow?"" or ""how did you know that?"" Hypothetically questions ask a hypothetical situation to a listener, for example ""if you were to have an extra ticket to any concert, what would you do?"" The optatives question is also known a wish question and asks the person for a favor, ""would you please pass my exam?"" 
   
Directive is another polite dialogicalte act.  It is often used by a speaker to ask someone else to take an action, it can also be used as a command, especially when it comes from a higher authority. Examples of directives include ""go to sleep"" or  ""stop smoking"". Commissives are used in a negative way, to express a lack of interest, concern, disapproval, etc. Commissive acts can be either negative or positive. Negative commissitives include words like 'no', 'never', or 'certainly'. Positive commissitive acts include 'I think',  'perhaps', and 'it depends'.

"
96,"Question: I'd like to help your stay at set, may I? 
Overinform: Your throat seems inflammed.  And your tongue is coated heavily. You have the symptoms of influenza. 
   
                                    Question : And you are? 
                       Overquestion: You are a guest at set hotel, May I help you?  
                     Directive: Please, help me to stay at this hotel! 
          Commissive : I will do my best to make your visit pleasant.

"
97,"""yes"" is used to confirm that the person speaking to the receiver has booked the room, and not just any old room that can fit the criteria. 
the use of ""it's"" indicates that this is a statement, not a request. 
                  ""it"" refers to a ""room"" which is ""booked"" by the sender.

"
98,"Directive is an act that conveys a message or instruction to another person or entity. In this case, a person is giving a gift to the recipient. 
  
Overinform is when a conversation is initiated with the intention of giving too much information. The listener is expected to ask questions or request clarification.  In this example, it is likely that the person offering the gift did not fully understand the message they were conveying. They should have waited to clarify the matter before offering a Gift. 
Question is another type of communication where the sender is expecting a reply from their listener. If the reply is not received, they will ask another question. Here, there is no directive act in this conversation. However, if the answer to their question is ""yes"", then they should consider the question answered and move on. Committing to something without knowing if it's possible or feasible is considered commissIVE.

"
99,"In this example, ""why not go now?"" suggests a response from conversation partners. The speaker wants to guide the dialogue towards an outcome or action.

"
100,"Because the context of the conversation suggests that there is a request or instruction for the other person to carry out, Commissive dialogue acts are typically used when someone is asking someone to do something. In this case, ""yes, let’s see"" suggests the two of you are going to look at the pictures together, so Commissives are the most appropriate dialogue action to use.

"
101,"This text could be asking the person if they are busy the morning of tomorrow, but it could also be an acknowledgment that they do not have an answer to the question. It is difficult to determine without knowing the context of who is speaking and to whom the statement/question is being addressed.

"
102,"Question dialogue acts typically ask for clarification or information. In this case, it's unclear what the person asking is looking for, so the response is classified here. 
Out of question: question is a subset of the more general dialogue action out, meaning it is used to describe a more specific action than the one it contains. Out of questions are:

Directive: tell, tell the customer to do something
 commissitive: promise to, make a commitment to
Inform: share information, share facts
question: ask a questions, ask about, inquire
Request: request, request for
Command: give a commands, give an order
Assent: agree to

"
103,"Inform is a good dialogueact to use when you are conveying your understanding of something. For example, if you're explaining to someone how to do something, you can use the phrase ""I understand."" This is because ""understanding"" is an act that can be conveyed using the inform act, as opposed to other acts like question or command.

"
104,"Inform is used to provide information without making any request or commitment, such as 'I just realized I've been waiting for this report for a week. I'll go ahead and write it now.'. 
Question is usually used in a conversation to seek clarification, as in 'Do you want the report now or later?'. 
  Question can also be used as a request, in which case it is classified under question:  'Do I need to bring anything for the party?', 'What time do you expect them to get there?'. 
   Directive is when you are giving instructions, for example 'Go to the store and buy milk'.
  Commissive indicates a person making an agreement, usually in the context of negotiation, 'We can discuss the price if you have some time'.

"
105,"Over-classifying a dialogue acts as question or inform can lead to incorrect predictions. Dialogue acts are not always one of these four labels, so it is important to understand the context of each dialogue and the relationship between the two parties.

"
106,"'yep?' is a confirmation of the fact that it is 6:30. 
'ten after 6' is the current time. 
  'we're' and 'dinner' are the subject and object of 'late'. 
 'but' indicates a counterpoint to the previous statement and is therefore classified here as a conditional.

"
107,"In this example, ""i'm sorry"" is an apology, not a directive. 
""i lost"" can also be considered an informational statement, rather than a statement of fact. 
  

A:
According to Dialogue Act Labeling Wiki: 

 

Over-inform:  This is a type of directive dialogue acts that are used too often.  They are not questions or commands, but instead are just information being given.   
Under-informed: This is another type, this type is used when the information given is not enough to make the decision.

"
108,"In this example, ""the lost & found"" office is a common noun that is used as a noun to describe a type of office, not a specific office in particular. Therefore, it does ""not ask any questions, commit any actions, express any opinions, nor give any orders"".

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Stalnaker, there are 6 possible dialogue acts: 
1. question
2. directive
3. commissivo
4. inform
5. exclamativo
6. interjectivo

"
109,"the text does share information (it could be a potential situation that causes a delay in a journey)
it does ask questions (why is the traffic so bad? what could have caused it?)
but it does so in an informative way, not as a direct question
and it also provides a solution to this problem (you could try to find a better route, if available, you could also call a taxi)

"
110,"Question is one of the most common dialogue acts. A question asks a
question, gives a request or makes a demand. In this case, it's asking a 
request or making a recommendation. 

 

In this context, sure. is an example of confirmation or affirmative statement. The speaker is confirming or affirming the information given before.

 
  

Sure. can also be classified under directive act. This act suggests course or action.

  


Well,  you really did not do that good in that exam. Is an assessment of your performance. So, in this situation, we can classify the question as directive

"
111,"Hemingway's text contains a series of questions that seek to understand the thoughts and feelings of the main character. The questions are posed in a sequence that implies a causal relationship between the previous question and this one: ""why did you come here?"". In addition, Hemingways use of ""the man"" and ""sea"" in the title of his short story suggests that this is a story about the relationship of man to nature. Therefore, based on these factors, it is likely that Hemingsway intended for the dialogue to be question-based.

"
112,"Inform is used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision. For example, when a person is asked for information, but does not have enough information to decide whether to buy a product or not. Inform can also be used in a request for service, where the person requesting the service does so politely, to let the receiver know that they have a copy of the requested item.

"
113,"Directive is the most general type of dialogue acts. Directives are used to request a specific action to be taken by the other person. In this case, we are requesting the person to hold the phone for us. 
  
Over directive is used when a directive request is made and the action is not clear from the given context. For example, if a person asks you to turn on a light, you could either turn the light on or turn it off. Turning it on would be an over directive as turning it would already be sufficient. However, turning the lights off is under directive and would require you first to ask them to do so.

"
114,"This text indicates the need for detailed information about a particular topic. The person asking the question is not providing the information herself, but rather is requesting it from someone else. Therefore, this is classified here as an overinform question because it does not provide enough information to answer the request. 
  
In addition, since the asker is looking for someone to provide information for her, she is also asking a directive question which requires an answer that is in the form of information (i.e. a map). 
"
115,"In the beginning of your text you mentioned that you were lost. This suggests that the person you're talking to is also the one providing the information in this conversation. Therefore the classification of commissives is justified.

"
116,"Question: It is a grammatical question. The word 'how' is used as a conjunction, linking two independent clauses. In the first clause, 'it' refers to the price of the taxi ride. 'How much' indicates the amount of money being asked. 
  
Out of question: This is not a valid question because the word how is only used to introduce a sentence, not as an independent clause.

"
117,"Inform is used when the information being provided is not critical to the outcome of the interaction. For example, when a person is asked a simple question like ""how are you?"", inform is the most appropriate dialogueact. 
  
Question is when someone is being asked for clarification. The question is followed by a response that provides the clarification requested. Example: ""are you hungry?"" ""yes"".

Directive is for when you are asking someone to perform an action, or taking action on someone else's behalf.  Example:  ""go to sleep"" ""you need to get some rest"". 
 Commissive, is to express frustration or anger. It is often used in indirect or indirect-object conversations.

"
118,"Inform (or shared information) is a dialogueact in which the
speaker is sharing information without making a request or
making a claim. Inform acts are typically used when the content of
the information is not relevant to the topic of the dialogue,
when the information does provide useful context or background
for the current conversation, when it's a matter of passing on
information that was already known to both parties, and when
sharing information would be considered polite.

"
119,"In this example, we can see that the dialogue acts are classified in the directive category. The speaker wants a certain action to happen, so the act should be classified this way. 

Here is an example of a text that is classified under the question dialogueact:
Hi there! I am calling from [Company name]. I was wondering if you could help me with [request].  Please let me know what you need and I will do my best to help you.  Thank you!
This text contains a call to action, where [company name] is requesting that you let them know if they can help [requester] with a [question].

"
120,"Directive is the most common dialogue acts in English. Directives are used to express instructions, requests, and prohibitions. They are also used when someone is making a request for information or when a person is expressing their preference. 
  
Inform is another common dialogical act in english. Informers are usually seeking confirmation, information, direction, etc. from the other person.

"
121,"This text indicates a desire for the receiver to do something, so it falls into the commissives category. 
  
  The text asks for a response and indicates the desire to hear an account of how this was accomplished. Therefore, it can be classified in the question category as well.

"
122,"""when do"" is a temporal question word. Based on this, we predict that this person is asking when the person needs the hotel room, such as ""when are you arriving?"" or ""When do we need to book the next room?""

A:
According to the book ""Text Analysis for Linguists"" by John McWhorter, there are 4 basic types of questions: declarative, interrogative (which includes both question and directive), imperative, exclamatory.  The text you provided is more of an exclamation than a declaritive or interrogatory question.

"
123,"Because the statement is simply sharing the plans of where the conversation is taking place. The speaker has not asked a direct question or given a direction, and does provide some context for where they will likely be. However, this is more of an informational statement than a dialogueact.

"
124,"In this example, we can see that the speaker has provided information to the listener, but also has suggested a course or action for them to take. This is an example of directive communication, as the information is provided to help the receiver make a decision, and the suggestion is to move forward with that decision.

"
125,"""it depends"" is a statement that is asking for a clarification. 
the price is an example of how the information is conveyed. 
  The price of the gas is used to determine how it is utilized.

"
126,"Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive: This text is conveying information about the cost of the room. 
Overinform: the price is $308, this is more than expected. 
  Question: who is asking for the specific room type? 
   Directive : give me the best room available.  
   CommissIVE: I need this room for my wedding night, please find a better rate.

"
127,"This text is expressing dissatisfaction with something the person is saying. This is an indication that it could be classified under the commissIVE dialogue acts. 
  
  The text: ""i've been waiting for this sale for months, why did you wait until now to tell me?"" indicates the writer is frustrated with what the addressee is telling him/her. The writer seems to be asking why the information was not provided earlier.

128,"Smoking and nonsmooking are two different types or varieties of cigarettes. Smoking is the act or habit of smoking cigarettes, while nonsmosoking refers to someone who does NOT smoke cigarettes (i.e., does  not engage in the smoking act). The question here is whether the person prefers smoking to nonsmogoking. If the answer is yes, then the question is about preference. However, if no, than the preference is not relevant and the response can simply be ""I do not prefer either smoking nor nonsmoloking.""

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by William Stuke and John C. Trimble, there are 8 possible dialogue acts: 
1. Question
2. Directive
3. Commissive  (commands)
4. Affirmative
5. Negative
6. Request
7. Inform
8. Explanatory

"
129,"the text mentions nonsmokey as an option, but does so in the negative. That is, it does mention that smoking is not an acceptable option. However, there is no mention of why the smoker is unacceptable. 
It is possible that this is a reference to the recent smoking ban in restaurants and bars in California. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, you are right.  The text does ask for information.

"
130,"the text asks a direct question to a non-smoking person about whether a Queen-size bed is okay. 
this is because the question is about smoking, and the non smoker is being asked to make an opinion about something that is related to smoking. 
  

In contrast, if the same text was classified under inform or commissives, then the directive label would be missing.

"
131," commissives are used when the sender of the message wants the receiver to do something, such as take an initiative or make a decision. In this case, it's likely that your wife will receive the flowers. 
questionals are often used to seek information, and commissivos are typically used as a way to give direction. 
  In this situation, your question 'yes?' indicates you are seeking clarification, so it would be classified a query.

"
132,"Mr. Sandals provided the phone numbers of both himself and the person he was booking. This is a strong indication that Mr.Sandals is directing the other party to his phone. 
  
  The phone conversation can also be classified under directive as Mr Sandels is asking for a phone and providing the number of the one he is booking, who is not able to provide a number at this time.

"
133," commissives are used when the interlocutor is expected to do something, take action, or comply with the request made by the other person. For example, a commissIVE dialogue acts include orders, requests, and apologies. 
  
overinform, overquestion, overtalk, overlabel

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Stalnaker, there are 6 possible dialogue actions: question; directive; inform; request; command; apology. 
In your example the dialogue action is request, because the person asking the question is expecting a response.

"
134,"A:

I think the answer is that it's a ""hot potato"" because it is a potentially dangerous situation.  If you drive through the red line, you could get a ticket.

"
135,"This text contains a request or directive for something to happen. The speaker wants the person to whom they are speaking to take action. 
In this case, it is the gas station owner who is being asked or directed to give the customer their bill.

"
136,"In the given context, this statement 'and chINA is THE homeland OF tea' is a statement of fact. Statements of facts are typically commissives. 
  
However, since the statement does ask for further information, and does give instructions and commitments, we predict it to be a request for information under question.

"
137,"Inform is a generic dialogueact that can convey a wide range of messages. Based on this example, it can appear to ask an question when in fact it does convey some information. This is because the information is about when the need for the requested room arises, rather than a request for confirmation. 
Question is another generic label that is often used to denote a dialogue acts that are seeking information or confirmation from the other party. In this case, Mr Sandal's response is not providing any information, so the question label is appropriate.

"
138,"Question is the most common dialogueact in this example. In this case, it is likely because of the use of ""sir"" in the last sentence. ""Sir"" is an informal way of addressing someone in a formal setting, and it can be used to address someone regardless of their age or social status. 
  
Inform is another common dialogical act in that text. It is used when the information provided is for informational purposes only and does not require a reply. This is because inform is considered to convey a neutral meaning.

"
139,"In the first instance, there is a discrepancy between the amount of money charged and the original amount. In this case, it is clear that a double charge has taken place. 
However, in addition to this, a second instance of charging the customer the exact same amount appears. Here, I believe the company is attempting to trick the consumer into paying twice.

"
140,"In the example provided, ""i’ll just going and checking it"" indicates the individual is going to do something for another person. This is a strong indication of a commissIVE dialogue action.

"
141,"the text begins with ""good morning"" and then switches to ""evening"" mid-sentence, suggesting that it is likely not a first sentence of the dialogue;
it is unclear whether the person asking is male or female, as the gender is missing from the beginning of each sentence; and
there is no indication of whether or not the question is posed to an automated system or to some human being.

"
142,"the text asks if something else the buyer would like is available. The question is seeking information, and the answer is yes, i purchased this item yesterday, so the question was answered.

"
143,"Question dialogue acts are used to request information from the listener. In this example, it appears that someone is asking the person at whom they are speaking if they need to do anything before they leave for the day. 
Inform dialogue Acts are typically used when sharing information, and the information being shared is not a request for a specific action. The example text indicates the price of the room, but does so without asking if the guest needs the hotel room before leaving for their destination. Therefore, this is classified under question.

"
144,"Inform is a non-verbal communication style that communicates facts or information without asking questions or giving directives. The inform style is often used when someone is sharing information or facts about a topic that is of personal interest to the person sharing the information. 
  
Question is another nonverBAL communication Style that asks a direct question of a person or group. This question can be asked in a casual or formal setting. A question may be answered with a statement, a comment, another question or a more detailed answer.  When someone asks you a ""question"" it may actually be a disguised directive.

"
145,"the text is asking a person to look over an invoice, a typical request in a commissIVE dialogue acts. 
there is a lack of any information in this statement, as the person asking for the look-over is not providing any context or details about what the document is or why they need to see it. 
  

A:
According to the GPT-2 model, this is the correct answer: directive.

"
146,"In this example, based on what the author is requesting, it seems like the answer should be a yes. However, if we look at each of these options, they all seem to be more of information than a direct answer:

Yes, I would love to join you for a movie on fridays. 
  Yes I will join  you for the movie this Friday.  
  Sure, let me know when and where.   
These all appear to provide more information, rather than an affirmative answer, so the dialogue acts in this case are classified commissively.

"
147,"Out of the four possible dialogue acts, this is the only one that is classified a commissIVE. The recipient is being asked to accept the apology, indicating that they are being commanded or instructed by the sender.

"
148,"This text contains a command, ""thank you."" Commands are typically commissives. 
There is also a request, in the form of an offer of thanks, that is over-informative. The command is unnecessary, since the person being thanked is already expressing gratitude. 
  

A:
According to this article, there are four possible dialogue acts for a given text: ive, you, him, her.  The article goes on to say that if the answer is more than one of these, then the prediction is inconclusive.

"
149,"In this example, we can see that there is an informational statement that is followed by a request. The request is for a guarantee, so it is considered commissitive. However, it also contains an element of reassurance, since the statement ""this has never happened before"" implies it cannot possibly happen twice. Therefore, this is a mix of question and directive dialogue acts.

"
150,"This text indicates the action the speaker wants the listener to take. The speaker is requesting the flowers be bought for her wife, indicating that this is an act the wife would want the speakers to do. 
  
  The text also indicates it's a polite request, so the directive dialogue is appropriate.

"
151,"the text is asking the person making the reservation for their contact information, and not simply providing it;
it is a directive dialogueact because it is an instruction or request; and
this is because of the use of ""you"" in the second sentence, as this is another way of asking ""why"" - the answer to which will be that people in Asia Europe enjoy red rose.

"
152,"Question: ""what will the cost of these roses be?""

This text is asking a direct question about a cost. The cost is an important aspect of a transaction, and the question of how much something will cost helps the recipient determine if the offer is worth considering. 
  
In contrast, inform:
""these roses look lovely""
or
""(the) roses are lovely, thank-you""

"
153,"'they’re only 20 dollars a handful' is an example of over-information, because it provides too much information. The speaker should have chosen their words more carefully, perhaps by saying 'only twenty dollars' or 'the price is twenty bucks'.

A:
According to the definition of Dialogue Act from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_act: ""A dialogue acts are the combinations of words and phrases that constitute a particular type of speech act. They are not to be confused with words or phrases which are used in a discourse but are neither speech acts nor part of a dialogue.""
In this case, ""they are only twenty dollar a dozens"" is not a speech action, but rather information that is being shared between the two people.

"
154,"Inform is a positive response indicating that a prediction made in the previous paragraph was correct. Inform indicates a desire for confirmation or a willingness to share information. 
  
Question is another positive prediction, but it is not clear if this is an inform or if it should be classified differently. The predicted label for question is inform. 
Directive is also a good prediction. It is clear that this label is appropriate for this dialogue. Directives are instructions or commands.  The given statement could be considered an instruction to place one's hands on one’s head. There are no promises or commitments being given. Therefore, this could also be categorized as directive.

"
155,"This text does ask an open-ended question about today’s gas price, but the answer is provided in the passage above. The passage provides the gas-price information as part of an explanation of why they were late that evening. Therefore, this is an over-inform text. 
  
However, if the question had been closed- ended, then the classification would have been inform rather than question.

"
156,"Directive is a type of dialogueact used when someone is requesting or directing something from another person. In this case, a person is telling a restaurant to give them a reservation.

"
157,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask questions. In this example, we can see that ""what to"" is used as the question word. The speaker wants to know something from you, and is using a form of communication that is commonly used for asking questions (e.g., ""can you please tell me what you would like?""). 
  
Overinform dialogue Acts are a type of question that asks too much information, for example ""why are you crying?"". 
 Question dialogueacts are classified into two categories: directive and commissives. Directive dialogue actions are actions that are commonly performed by a person who is in charge of something, such as ""stop the car"" or ""turn left at the next intersection"". Commissives are the actions of a subordinate asking a superior for permission, direction, etc. ""Can you tell my teacher that I want to take a test in my free period?"" is a commissIVE.

"
158,"Inform is the most general dialogueact, indicating that someone is providing general information. The predicted label for this dialogue acts is overinform because the provided information was too general. For example, ""yes"" is too broad a response to the question ""are there enough outlets?"". 
Question is another general category of dialogueacts, and the label overquestion indicates the response was not specific enough. In this case, because ""i am fearful there aren't enough"" does not provide enough information to determine whether there is an actual concern or if the person is expressing an opinion. 
  
Directive is one of the more specific dialogue Acts, providing instructions on how to carry out an activity.  The label directive indicates this response is instructive.   
Commissive indicates someone making an agreement to a certain action, such as ""sure, I'll do it!"". Here, this label is used because this is likely the final response of a conversation, so it provides the listener with the information they need to move forward with their plans.

"
159,"inform is used when the information being shared is already known to the listener, and the sender is simply providing additional context or background information. 
question is a request for information
directive is an instruction to act in a certain way
commissive indicates a command or order

In this case, it appears that inform is being used to provide additional information about the action of pulling over the car. The question is why, indicating that this information is new to both the driver and police officer. Finally, there is the directive to ""pull over"", indicating a demand for action. All of these characteristics make this a directive rather then a commissIVE command.

"
160,"Question: the given statement is a request for assistance or information. The speaker does ask for an answer, but does so in the form of a declarative statement, not a directive or commissIVE. Therefore, this is classified under question rather than inform or overinform.

"
161,"This text contains a request for information from the addressee. However, it also contains an order or request that is not explicitly stated in the dialogue. In this case, there is a suggestion that if the person asking does not have enough plugs, they should go out and get more. 
  
Inform: ‘yes’
Question:  ‘there are’ 
   
Directive: Go out get the plugs. 
Commissive : ‘ go get’

"
162,"In this example, ""here are the films"" is an informational statement, and the response ""can i gets my picture tomorrow?"" is informational as well. Therefore, inform is classified in both examples.

"
163,"the text does not seek confirmation from the receiver (the recipient is the one who broke the devices, so asking them to send a repairman is unlikely to result in a positive response)
it is an instruction or a plan of what the two of you could do together (i.e. 'let's meet at coffee shop')

In summary, this is one of the ways to identify a dialogue acts:
1. Analyze the content of your conversation. 
2. Predict the label of each label for each predicted label.

"
164,"This text is asking the person waiting a moment to be patient. This is a request for the recipient to comply with a demand or instruction. 
  
  The text can also be seen as asking for confirmation, as it uses the word'sure'. This indicates the sender is expressing certainty or assurance about something.

"
165,"Question is a sub-set of directive. In this case, it is used to elicit information from the driver. 
In this example, 'why did you stop me?' is the question. 'Pulled me' is information that is being shared.

"
166,"Question: the question mark indicates the dialogue acts are seeking clarification or confirmation. The question is not asking information, but seeking it. 
  Out of Inform: this is the default dialogue action for text that is requesting information. It indicates you should respond with the information requested. In this case, it's running a  red light.

"
167,"Question: i rana red  light? 
Information: I ran over a  red light. 

 

A:

This is a good question and I will try to answer it. The following is based on a machine learning model trained on data from a large corpus of human-written text. I would be happy to share the code and the model if someone is interested. 
  The text was classified correctly as a request for further information. Inform is the most likely dialogue response given the context of the question: ""What about Soup?"". However, there is also a possibility that question may be the correct response. ""My dear what’s for Supper?"" could be interpreted as asking about what the dinner will consist of, and not a simple request to provide information, as ""How about some soup? "".

"
168,"Inform is used when the information being provided is about something that is already known to the conversation participants. In this case, it is clear that the person providing the dietary advice is well-versed in the topic and is not asking or providing clarification. 
Overinform is when a message uses inform but includes information that was not known by the participant. 
  In this example, ""I try to only eat fruits and vegetables"" is overinformative, as it provides more information than was known. ""Eat fruits"" and ""eat vegetables"", on their respective own, are not particularly informative. However, when considered together, they provide a clear indication of what the advice will be.  
Question is the most common dialogueact in a conversation. It is marked by a request for clarification or information. This text contains both a statement and a directive. A directive is an order or instruction that requires a response. Here, both the statement "" I trymy best""  and the directive ""to eat"" are questions. When a person is asked a direct question they are expected to provide an answer. If they do not, then they have failed to comply with the order of their superior and are in breach of company policy. Therefore, this is considered to be a violation of corporate policy and will result in disciplinary action.

"
169,"Inform is the most general dialogue action, and indicates providing
  information. Inform can also be used as a noun, to describe someone who
is providing useful information: ""the mayor provided the information
that they would be presenting the report at a press conference tomorrow"").
Question is one of four types of dialogue acts, where the verb is
question. Question can be positive or negative, with the meaning of
""asking a direct question"": ""she asked me what time the meeting starts
and I told her; she asked if she could join the others for lunch and I
told her yes"". Question also includes a directive meaning, ""ask for
information or assistance"":  ""can you find someone to help me with this
task? I'm not sure where to start"". Commissive is another type of dialog
act, meaning ""requesting or commanding"":   ""I need you to do this for me
right now. Please don't ask any questions"".

Hope this helps!

"
170,"""Yellow"" is a color, and the color ""slow down"" does imply a directive or a warning. However, this is not the case in this context, where ""speed up"" implies a fact, namely that the driver can drive fast. 
  

A:
According to the definition of Dialogue Act in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_act,
Question: To ask; to put to a person or persons for information;
Inform:  To give information to someone; To tell someone something; 
Directive: A command given to another person to do something. 

 

So, in the above example, ""Yello means Slow Down, Not Speed Up"" the question is there as the sentence is asking the person for the information.

"
171,"Inform is the most general dialogueact, and indicates seeking information or direction from a recipient without committing to taking any action. 
  
Question is another general indication of seeking clarification. 
Directive is an instruction or request for action from another person or entity.  It is often used in negotiations or in asking for something to happen.   
Commissive indicates a command or order from an authority figure.

"
172,"In the given context, it is not clear whether the person who spoke to you is apologizing for something they have done, expressing their regret for an action they took, asking you to forgive them for their mistake, making a statement about your driving speed, commanding you not to speed again, promising you a discount for your next purchase, requesting a raise, giving you bad news, etc. 
  
It is possible that they are expressing regret or apology, but the context does  not provide enough information for us to make this determination. We will need to see more context to determine the exact nature and intent of the statement.

"
173,"Inform is used when the speaker is sharing information, and is not asking for confirmation or seeking clarification. 
  
Question is the most common dialogueact used in conversation. It is an attempt to gain information by asking an open-ended question that does not have a clear answer. In this case, it appears that you are trying ask the person a follow-up question about what they were asking you, but you haven't provided enough context to understand if you were successful.

"
174,"This text is a request or instruction from the police officer. He is asking the driver to stop the car, so he can write him a citation.

"
175,"Inform is a non-assertive dialogueact, meaning that it does not directly assert or deny what the other person is saying. Instead, it provides background or context that helps the listener understand what is being said. 

Question is another nonassertoric dialogueAct, asking questions that are not answered. 
  
Directive is assertoric, telling someone what to do.  It is used when the information being provided is important and needs to be followed.   
Commissive, is also assertoric,  it is when someone is making an offer or promise.

"
176,"Directive acts are used to give orders or instructions. In this case, it's likely that someone is being told to do something. Ernest Hemingway is famous for his short stories and novels, and this question is likely being posed to find out if the person asking has a book by his or her favorite author.

"
177,"In this example, ""roll of the film"" is a topic related to the driving exam, so the response is classified under a command or request. 
""can"" indicates a permission or permission to ask a follow up question: ""can you have my roll developed?""

A:
According to this article, there are four types of dialogue acts: urn, request, command, and suggestion.  The article goes on to say that the following are some examples of each:  
urn: This is an example of an urns dialogue action: “I’m sorry, I’ve just been informed that this meeting has now been cancelled.”
request: In this case, a request is being made of someone. An example would be “Would you like some coffee?”
command: A command is used to give orders to another person. For example “Call the meeting to order.” or “Stop talking and pay attention.”  An example is “You’re late again.”   Or “Don’t talk with your mouth full.” 
 suggestion: Suggestion is when you are giving information to someone to help them make a decision. “This may help you make your decision.”

"
178,"This text uses the word'sure' to express certainty, a characteristic that is typically used to convey a request for confirmation or an order. Therefore, it has likely been categorized under the command dialogue acts. 
In addition, this is the first occurrence of the label commissIVE in the model, so it's possible that this label was not present in earlier versions of your model.

"
179,"Directive is a special type of command or request that is given with the expectation that it will be obeyed without further communication. 
  
  In this case, it is likely that this is an instruction to be followed by the addressee. The addressees is asked to get the pictures of the filmmaker, and the instruction is to immediately get them. Without further dialogue, this request is obeyeded.

"
180," commissives are used to express a request for information, clarification, a suggestion, an order, and a prohibition. 
  
overly informative: ""thankyou so mcuh, we are looking fwd to see you!""
question:  ""whatwere they? ""
directive:   ""mr.sandals,we are so looking forward tto seeingyou!"" 
 commissitive:    ""howcanihelpyou?""

A:
According to this article, you can use the predict_dialogue_act function in the dialog_squad package to get the prediction.

"
181,"In the above text the word ""two"" is used as the subject of an infinitive verb. This is a usage that is not found in other languages and is therefore not common in English. In this context, ""to two"" can mean to double, to add two, and it also can refer to the number two. The use of ""double"" in the context of two photos is unusual, but not unheard of. 
However, in addition to using the infinative verb form of to two in a way that was not typical of English, there is also a lack of context in which the two-photo request is being made. 
  The text does mention that the pictures need to arrive ""tomorrow"", but there are no other details about when the request needs to happen or what the consequences of not meeting the deadline will be. Without this additional context it becomes difficult to determine whether the directive request should be categorized as out of command or out a commissively.

"
182,"the text starts with ""tell"", which is a directive word, indicating that the content of what follows is an explanation
""a little"" is used as a qualifier, which indicates that this explanation is of a limited scope

In addition, ""please"" appears twice in the same sentence, suggesting that it may be used to request a favor from the listener.

"
183,"In this example, ""are"" is used as a modal verb, indicating that the question is open-ended and can be answered with either a ""yes"" or ""no"" response. Therefore, it can also be classified under the category of question. 
  
""are more"" indicates a comparative comparison between the two options, making it more similar to a comparison question than an informational question

A:
According to the Stanford Core Dialogue Acts Dictionary, there are 4 possible answers for the following question: ""Are you a Leader or Follower?"": 
1. Leader
2. Follow
3. Neither
4. Other
If the answer is neither, then the next step is to ask for a reason. In this case, I think the reason is ""I don't know"". The writer didn't specify what they are looking for, so the reader is left to speculate.

"
184,"the text does not provide enough information to classify the dialogue acts as inform or question
it seems like the message is requesting confirmation of something from the receiver, i.e. a preference or answer to a request for information

A:
According to the book ""Text Analysis for Linguists"" by John McWhorter, there are four possible types of questions: question-like questions, commands, directives, and requests.  
Question-Like Questions: These questions are similar to questions in that they are seeking information, but they do not have a clear question mark. For example, ""What is the capital of Italy?"". 
Commands: Similar to directives and commands are questions that are asking someone else to perform an action. ""Would you like some tea?"" ""Drive to work."" 

 

Directives: Directives are requests for someone's action or response. 
 ""Please pass the salt."" ""Turn off the lights."" 
 Requests: Request is used to ask for something that is in short supply.

"
185,"In this context, inform is the correct classification as the dialogue acts of the conversation are asking for information. The speaker wants the other person to tell them something, or ask them a specific question. 
  
Question is not applicable as there is no need for the questioner to seek information or seek clarification. They are simply asking a yes/no question of their own. 
Directive is also not appropriate as this is an instructional conversation. There is nothing to direct as both the asker and the answer are the same person. Commissive would also be incorrect as they are not asking someone to do something.

"
186,"the text does provide a factual piece about another beverage being second in popularity to water
it does ask for details, such as 'belief it' or 'it is surprising', which indicates a directive dialogue
as for promises, it does make one, 'tea is also very healthy', so the predict act should be commissIVE

"
187,"'i' is an indirect object, so the question is about something the listener should do. 
'things' are plural, therefore the answer should be plural as well. 
  'are' indicates a statement, not a query.

"
188,"""oulong tea"" is a food, so the question is about food. 
the text is seeking validation or confirmation from ""you"", which suggests it is being asked a yes/no question

text: ""ouLong tea  is good  for one's health.""
based on text:  ou Long tea, the food, so  the question  about food.
you: is it? 


"
189,"'overinform': The predicted label is too general, as it does include question and directive dialogue acts. 
'think twice': This is a judgement call, based on my understanding of the dialogue structure of 'I try...'. The label of question is included because the prediction is based off of a 'what' question: What does the character try to do? The directive label includes the word 'best' which can also be interpreted as a recommendation.

"
190,"Question is a specialised form of information that is sought by a human being to obtain further information. In this case, a person is interested in knowing what the respondent eats. The respondent is not being asked to perform any action, so the question is classified under the inform dialogue acts. 
  
Leader or follower? This is an evaluation question that requires a personal response. As the response is personal, this is considered a quest for a commissives dialogue.

"
191,"Inform is used to request or suggest information from another person. 
Question is the form of asking a yes/no question to a person, expecting a response. 
  Question can also be used as an adjective to describe a ""questionable"" or ""doubtful"" matter.  
Directive is an instruction or order given to another. Commissives are promises or assurances given by someone.

"
192,"'stick to thosefoods' is an instruction to the listener to follow the instructions of the person speaking. This is considered a directive dialogueact. 
the question mark in the beginning of 'how to stick' indicates that the question is open-ended and the answer depends on what the asker is looking for. In this case, 'thosefoods'.
question marks are often used in open questions to indicate that a statement is understood as a possible answer. The question marks in this example are used to emphasize that'stick' could mean a variety of different things. 
  

In summary, this is classified a Question Dialogue Act.

"
193,"In this example, we can see that although the dialogue acts are inform and overinform, they are actually conveying information and sharing the intention of doing something next. Therefore, this is not a valid reason to classify the classification of dialogue Acts as incorrect.

"
194,"the text asks a 'question' about whether or not to eat the chickens, since the answer is yes or no, it's a yes/no question

'yes' is a response to a query, and therefore it would be classified here as response. 
  'no' would not be considered a valid response here, because it does NOT provide any information, nor does it ask for confirmation.

"
195,"""i"" is the first person in the sentence, so it's considered to be inform. 
the phrase ""...there's no fat"" can also be interpreted as information, since it provides a detailed explanation of the reason for eating baked chickens. 
  

text: i mainly ate baked chiken because the meat was very juicy.

"
196,"Inform is used when the message is providing background information or context for a current situation. 
Question is the most likely dialogueact in this case, since the question marks in the beginning of the sentence seem to indicate that something is being asked. However, there is not enough context in that sentence to determine what exactly is going on.

"
197,"In this example, ""it does"" is providing factual information. However, it also serves as a statement of fact, so it can also be classified under the over category.

"
198,"""there"" is the subject of the sentence, so the question mark indicates a request for information. 
the sentence mentions three people in the family (my parents), so it's likely that the person asking the questions is also a member of that family. 
  

Therefore, I predict that this is likely a direct question: ""can i"" help ""you""?""
I would recommend reading the following article to learn more about dialogue acts: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_act

"
199,"In this example, we can see that the sender is expressing a willingness or interest in helping the receiver by offering them a suggestion or alternative. This is a directive statement as it tries to direct the other person towards taking a certain action.

"
200,"This text uses the word ""please"" twice, once as the subject of the sentence and again as an adverb to modify the verb ""here"" (here is). This is an example of ""commanding"" language, where the use of words like ""Please"" and ""Thank you"" indicate that a higher-level authority is speaking to a lower-ranked individual. 
  
In addition, this is the second time that ""they are"" is used as if it were a verb, indicating that this person was expecting a response and is now giving one. The use ""are"" instead of either ""is"" or ""were"" indicates a lack of certainty about what is being said. 
Thank You!

"
201,"Directives are not simply providing or asking for information. They are giving directions or instructions to someone or something else. In this case, ""may i"" is the directive and ""try that"" the instruction.

"
202,"""ofcourse"" is a statement that indicates the speaker's certainty or opinion, and is therefore classified under ""of"" (which indicates certainty). 
the fitting-room is over here, is another statement of certainty, so it has also been categorized as ""Of course"".

A:
According to this page, there are 5 possible dialogue acts: 

 
Out of Mind: This is the default. This indicates that the sender is not thinking of anything in particular and just wanted to communicate something. 

 

In Mind
This is an instruction to do something, such as to pay attention.

 
  
Question: Is this something you were thinking about?

 
   
Directive:  This indicates a request for something to happen, for example, ""Please pass the salt.""

 
     
Commissive
Commissive is used when a person is making a decision or taking an action.  

 
    
Promise: A promise is when someone says they will do or say something in the future.

"
203,"Question is the most likely dialogueact in this example. ""this one"" is an interrogative pronoun, and ""a little"" and the color ""tight"" are adverbs that can function as adjectives. Therefore, ""question"" was the prediction.

"
204,"Directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used when the information provided by the other person is not relevant or necessary for the receiver to make a decision. For example, a store clerk might say ""all the red ones are out of stock. Would you prefer a black one?"" This is an example of a direct question from a customer, where the customer is being asked to choose between two options. 
  
Out ofinform: This label is used for when information is provided to the listener, but the content is irrelevant or unnecessary for them to understand what is happening. The label outofinform is often used in the negative, to describe something which was provided but was not helpful or useful. An example would be ""your essay was out-of-scope for this course"", which means that your essay did not fall within the scope of the course.

"
205,"Question is a more specific dialogue action category than the others. The
predicted dialogue acts are question and directive. Question is used to
ask a specific question. For example, ""why do they call it the toaster?""
Directive is the opposite of question: it tells someone what to do. An
example of a directive dialogue is ""stop smoking"". The predicted
dialogue acts in this example are command and commissIVE. Command is
used to tell someone to perform an action. Commissive means to command
someone to, but does so in a way that implies a request for something in
return. In this case, it means ""please stop smoking.""

In summary, based on this analysis, we predict that the following dialogue Acts are used in context of text:
question
directive
command
commissive

"
206,"overinform: the dialogue acts of both the question and the directive are inform. 
question: ""oh yeah"", ""that suits"", and ""it is said in China that..."" are questions that seek information from a listener
directive: ""... brings happy and luck"" are commands that ask a person to do something
commissive : ""look into it"" and ""...believe in it in Chine"" indicate that someone is requesting someone else to perform an action

A:
According to your explanation, you are right.  The text ""good morning!  Can I Help You?"" is a request for help.

"
207,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask questions, but they do not provide information or request action from the person they talk to. Instead, they expect a response. 
  
  The text here is asking the helper (presumably a cash register) for a bill.

"
208,"Directive dialogue acts are used to request or order someone to do something. The directive dialogue is used when the information provided is not sufficient to make an informed decision. For example, a person may be asked to fill in a form to register for a course. In this case, filling the form is a request, not an expression of informed consent. 
  
In contrast, inform and question dialogue Acts are more likely to be used in situations where someone is expressing consent to something, and the person providing consent is being asked questions or is providing information.

"
209,"Question: the given textual content appears as though the speaker were seeking information from the listener. This is an indication that the dialogue acts of question and inform are similar. 
  Inform: this textual material does not provide any new or additional information, but rather evaluates or provides information on something already known to both the questioner and listener, making it a form of evaluation.

"
210,"Inform is a polite response that indicates the sender is trying to provide information to another person. In this case, it is the response of the person asking the question to give a suggestion or offer. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive: These are the possible dialogue acts for this example.

"
211,"Inform is used for sharing information, or for providing information that is already known. 
Question is for asking questions, such as ""is it hot in here?"" or ""why is the sky blue?"". 
  Directive is often used to give orders, for example, ""put the coffee on,"" or to request information from the listener, as in ""can you tell me where the bathroom is?"" Commissive, like commissario, means to make a commitment, but it can also be used as a command, especially when it is given in a commanding tone of voice, e.g., ""get the car ready.""

Given the above definitions, it seems that question is most likely the correct classification for this example.

"
212,"Inform is the default dialogueact in this context. It indicates the speakers are providing facts and information to the listener. 
Question is used when the information provided is not sufficient to answer the question and the asker is looking for confirmation. For example, ""is it true?"" or ""are they for real?""
Directive is when a person is making a request or order. ""Go get the car."" or  ""Stop talking and do as I say.""
Commissive indicates when there is an imbalance of power between the two parties. The person being spoken to feels as though they are being ordered to do something against their will. 
  For example: ""I will kill you ifyou don't shut up.""

"
213,"Question is a dialogue-act category that is used to seek information or advice from another person. 
In this case, it's the question of why the sender is trying to determine the answer. 
  
Out of question and question the latter two are sub-categories of questions. They are used when the information being sought is in the form of an opinion or an assumption. In this example, there is no information to be found in either of these forms.

"
214,"In this example, we can see that there is a strong indication that this is the request for a viewing of the property for lease. The speaker has clearly expressed their desire to show the space to potential tenants, which is in line with a direct request.

"
215,"This is a good example of how dialogue acts can help to classify text as being asking, telling, commanding, advising, pleading, warning, questioning, etc.

"
216,"This text does not provide any information or evaluation about whether the
  person being asked about has seen the company's car. Instead, it asks a
   question about something else the recipient might want to add. As a result,
the text should be classified under the dialogue acts of question and
inform.

"
217,"In this example, there are two possible dialogue acts: inform and directive. Based on this passage, inform is the most likely dialogueact, because the passage provides general information that the listener would find useful, while directive is more specific and asks a direct question. 
  
  Inform: Yes, you have  one copy  left. 
Directive: There is  only one  copy  remaining.

"
218,"Directive is a directive act, indicating that a person or group is giving orders or making a request. In this case, a direct order is being issued by the caller to the callee. 
  
Overinform is another term used to indicate that someone is oversharing or sharing too much information. The callees information is not being restricted, so the overinform label is applied. 
Question is also a possible label, as the question mark indicates uncertainty or doubt. However, in the given example, there is an explicit request for further information, making this a query.  

"
219,"Directive dialogue acts are used to guide the interaction, to give orders or to make requests. In this case, it is clear that this is a request for a replacement item. 
Question dialogue Acts are often used when someone is trying to get information from you, and you are trying  to verify or confirm what they have said. Here, there is no clear request, as the question is more of a clarification. However, if the request is made in a way that is likely to lead to information being provided, then a query dialogue is usually the next step.

"
220,"In this example, we can see that the dialogue acts are predictably informative (i.e. inform and inform) and the response is also informative, so the overall response score is 100. However, if we look at the second example we see a prediction of a dialogueact that is question (question), a fact that we don't know at this point (we don’t know the actual dialogue action label), and a response that does not provide any additional information (the recipient has already been provided with the information in this case). This makes the prediction for this response to be directive.

"
221,"This text contains a request for a future action, rather the informational statement about past events. 
It is a conditional statement that is not supported by the surrounding context.

"
222,"the text contains a request for information which can only be satisfied by giving an answer, thus making this a commissIVE dialogue
it is a directive dialogue, as the message is requesting a response from the receiver, and the response is to be given in the form of information

A:
According to your explanation, I think the following dialogue acts are commissives: question and inform.

"
223,"Directive is the most common dialogue action in insurance sales. Directives are used to provide instructions to the customer. In this case, John wants to know what insurance John is interested is. 
Question is another common insurance dialogue  act. Questions are often used by the insurance agent to gather more details from customer about their insurance needs. John may ask John'what is your insurance interest?', which would be classified in question dialogue.

"
224,"Inform: the first part of 'the text' (the 'don't') is an informational statement providing general information. The second part ('do it again') asks a follow-up question. 
Question: there is a possibility that 'do' in 'Do it Again' can also be interpreted as a command. However, in this case, it would be a committment question (Do you promise to never do it the same again?), which is also a different kind of question than the one asked in inform. 
 Directive: this is the most interesting case. 'Don't Do It Again', in my opinion, is actually a direct order. But the way it's written, I can't tell if it should be classified under directive or commissIVE. I would classify it as directive, because the order is clear and the person to whom it applies is explicitly mentioned.

"
225,"Out of context, this sentence could be interpreted as a recommendation or a suggestion for the taxi driver to take a vacation. However, in this specific context it is simply information. 
Of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the most appropriate. This is because the information provided is about a current event, and the person receiving the message is not expected to make any changes to it.

"
226,"Question dialogue acts are used to seek information from another person. In this case, it appears that 'What am I supposed do?' is a request for clarification, and therefore a query rather then a directive or commissivo act

"
227,"In this example, ""yes"" is an affirmative response indicating that a decision has already been made by the person asking. Therefore, this is considered aninform dialogueact. 
  
If the response was ""all the insurances will not be link with my work"", it would be consider question as the answer indicates uncertainty.

"
228,"the text asks a follow-up question after providing basic information (hello, i'm here to help, can i assist you?), which indicates that this is a more complex question than simply asking for basic assistance;
this is also the first time the question has appeared in this conversation, indicating that there is more than one question in the context of the given dialogue; and
it is likely that a commissives is intended, as the preceding text provided a recommendation for the follow up question: ""may i suggest you try this?"".

"
229,"Directive is a type of dialogue acts that are used to convey orders, requests, and instructions to another person. 
  
Overinform is another type  of dialogueact that is used when a message is too informative.  It is similar to inform but conveals a request for more information than is actually necessary.

"
230,"In this example, there is a lack of context in the given sentence. The sentence is not clear as to what the question is, and the context of the surrounding text does provide some clues. Based on this context, we can see that this is likely a request for information.

"
231,"In the first line, ""it"" is used as an object, but it is not clear whether ""the hot potatoes"" are a group of hot dogs or a single item. The use of ""hot potato"" alone is ambiguous. 
""it's really"" can be used to express uncertainty or doubt. In this case, it's unclear whether the hot dog vendor is expressing uncertainty about whether it will rain or whether they are unsure of whether or not it has rained in the past. 
  
  In ""i mostly eat"", ""mostly"" implies that this is an incomplete statement. ""Eat"" should be the main verb.

"
232,"This is because the given statement is not an expression of gratitude or an explanation of current circumstances. Instead, it is an order or a request for action. In addition, there is no mention of any expertise or knowledge that the person being addressed has. Therefore, this is classified under the commissives category.

"
233,"Directives are statements that seem to offer assistance, make requests, or take action. They are often used in a commanding tone of voice. 
In this example, it appears that Michelle is offering to help Mr Sandal with his needs.

"
234,"Inform: the information the person is providing is not relevant to what the question is
Question: there is no indication in the passage that this is an informational question
Directive: this person seems to be giving a command or order to another person
 commissIVE: it could be a request, but it also could mean that they're trying convince someone of something

A:
According to your text the following dialogue acts are possible: 
question, inform, directive and commissitive. 

 
Let me explain what each of these mean. 
 question: This is used when you are asking someone for more information, for example ""how did you find out about the event?"". In this case you can use this dialogue tag when the answer is more of an explanation than a simple yes or no answer. For example, ""I asked my friend who he talked to, and he said that you found out from your mom."" 

 

inform: Inform is when someone is telling you something, this can be done by using the present tense, such as ""the event is on Saturday at 2pm"" or ""there is going to a party on friday night"". In inform the other person must be able to understand what you're saying, so if you want to inform someone about something you should write it out, or say it in a way that is easy for the receiver to hear. If you don't know the exact meaning of the word inform then you could use inform here.

 
 Directive : This can also be called a order, in this situation the order is given to do something else, like ""go to work, you have to go to school to graduate"".

 
 commissative: Commissive is the same as inform except it can only be used in negative sentences, meaning when something bad is happening, it's commissing something to happen,  for example if someone tells you that there's going be an earthquake in 5 minutes you would use the commiss tag because they want something negative to happend.

"
235,"Inform: the first part of the sentence provides the details about where to mail the letter, without any request for action. 
Question: ""where can I mail it"" is a request, and it is followed by a non-action verb ""then"". This indicates a questioning tone, making it question instead of simply inform.

"
236,"the text indicates the direction of travel by mail, rather than by car or plane, and the destination is marked out, so the act has also been marked as directive. 
it is a request, not a command, since the addressee is not expected to do anything immediately.

"
237,"Inform is used when the context does not clearly indicate the nature of the communication. For example, when a person is giving information to another person, it can often be difficult to determine whether they're giving a recommendation, requesting assistance, or expressing a complaint. 
  
Question is a communication style that is seeking information from another. It is often used in a conversation when one person wants to know something from a different person and does want the answer. The other party does need to provide the information, and the questioner does get the answers they seek. However, if the asker is not clear about what they want, then the response may be classified in question as well.

"
238,"Inform is a good dialogueact to use when you are providing orconfirming information to a recipient, especially if the information is new to them or requires some explanation. 
Overinform is used when the message contains too much information, and the goal is to make the communication as efficient as possible. For example, a salesperson might use overinform when trying to convince a customer to buy a product. 
  
Question is good for when a sender wants to get information directly from a receiver. The question is usually followed by a response from that receiver, so the response can be used to answer the question.  For example: ""Do you have any questions?"" ""yes, I have one: why do you ask me this?""
Directive is often used in negotiations or business transactions. A directive act can indicate that a message is meant to influence or guide the behavior of the receiver in some way. Directives are usually given in response to an action by the intended receiver (e.g. ""Buy this product because it will make your life better"").
Commissive acts are used for expressing a request or order. Commands are often given with a commissitive act, but can also be given as an order with the commissitious act following it. An example of a commissive act would be ""Call me when it's done"".

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue for Dummies"" by William Zinsser, there are four basic types of dialogue: irequest, answer, order,  and warning. I'm not sure if this is the same as the four types in the DARPA system, however, it is an excellent resource for learning about dialogue.

"
239,"Question: We really didn’t have much notice. We were told that we should arrive by 7 pm, but we arrived at 6:45 pm. Did we miss the reservation? 
  Overinform: No, we were able to snag one of the remaining tables. 
   Question : But why did we have to wait in such long line? 
Overquestion: I don’ t know. I guess they ran out of tables?

"
240,"Overinform: This dialogue acts is overinform, as it provides more information than is necessary to make the point being made. In this case, ""i'm Glad That We Didn't Have To Wait Long"" and ""I'm Starving"" are both facts, so the information provided is redundant. 
Question: Although the statement is a fact, there is no indication that it was asked or answered. The question mark indicates uncertainty, and the use of the word ""question"" indicates the form of an inquiry. 
  The text indicates a desire for information, asking ""are You Aware That You Driven Through A Red Light?"".  
Directive: although the first sentence is informational, in the second sentence, KARA is addressed as ""you"", which indicates an order. Directives are used to give instructions or orders.   
Commissive : although this statement does not make any commitments, a commissitive act can be used when a person or group makes a promise or commitment to do something.

"
241,"Question: let's takes a looks at menu, so that we could order for you. Do you wish to select an Appetizer to Share with us? 
Overinform: sure, go ahead. 

 

question: ok. what do we have?

Note: the ingredients are not listed in the order they appear on this menu.

  


Here is the appetizers menu: 

 

 - fried Calamaris
 Fried calamares (squid) are a popular appetiser in Spain and other Mediterranean countries. They are fried and served with garlic and scallops. 
 - garlic
 Scallions are the white and green parts of the scallop. Garlic is used in many dishes to add flavor and color. It is also a good source of vitamin C.  
 
 - hot Peppers
 Jalapenos are small, green, red, orange, or yellow, round or long, pointy or not, with or without seeds. Serranos are similar to the other types, but have a fresher, more intense flavor. Fresnos are green and red. Green and yellow are neon. Red and orange are bright. 
 
Shrimp cocktail is shrimp, scallIONS, ginger and shallOTS.
 
 Shrimp
 Shrimps are eaten raw, in a cocktail, as an hors d'oeuvre, cooked, marinated, fried, baked, etc.
 
ScallIONS are white, pink, blue, purple, gold, silver, bronze, copper. ScALLIONS have many uses in cooking. Ginger is an ingredient in shrimp cocktails. ShallOTs are used to give shrimp a special flavor, such as in fried shrimp.
 
 
Ginger
 Gingers are rhizomes of Zingiber officinale, a plant of family Zingeraceae. There are about 60 species of ginger in about 30 genera and 5 families. Most ginger is grown in Asia, where it is cultivated for its rhysm, curry, pickle, juice, food flavorings, medicine, spice, vegetable oil, wine, alcohol, fodder, soil conditioner and as a source for gingerols and shogaols. In the United States, it has become an invasive species. Some ginger has medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, antiulcer, diuretic, expectorant, antispasmodic, aphrodisiac, sedative, hypotensive, hypoglycemic, emmenagogue, uterine stimulant and antihistamine properties. A few ginger varieties are grown for food in North America. These include the rhubarb-type ginger (also known as kaffir lime ginger), the Thai ginger or kripsyll, Thai holy basil, Sichuan ginger; and the root ginger used for pickling. Other species are cultivated as ornamentals. Thin-leaf ginger can be used fresh or dried. Dried ginger may be reconstituted in hot water before use. Fresh ginger should be peeled before using. Recipes that call for fresh ginger include ginger ale, mulled wine and gingerbread. Reconstituted dried ginger contains up to 30% sugar. To make ginger beer, mix equal amounts of water and powdered ginger. For ginger wine or vermouth, add 2 ounces of vodka to 1 ounce of reconstitution of dried or fresh grated ginger to make 1½ ounces. This mixture can also be added to cocktailing drinks. When using dried grated fresh, use only one-third of what is called for in recipes. If using fresh rhododendron ginger from a garden, be sure to check with your local health department before growing it. Rhododenron is toxic to humans. Use only Thai or Szechuan holy basils. Avoid kafir limes.

 
 ShallOTTes are also used as flavoring in food, especially in Asian cuisine. Shiso (Perilla frutescens) is another popular herb used. Both are aromatic herbs with a slightly bitter flavor that are often used with other herbs to balance their flavor or to provide a fresh herbaceous flavor to a dish. Their use is similar in function to salt. As a condiment, they can add a refreshing flavor contrast to many savory dishes. Like salt, their use can help to draw out the flavors of other ingredients. Unlike salt which can overwhelm flavors, shallOTTES and herbs can complement other flavors.

 Suggestions:

 
 Ordering:

"
242,"Question: I would prefer to have poppy-doms. Why? Because I like the taste better. 
  Overinform: Both are delicious. So which one would be better for you? 
   Question : I prefer poop-pads. That ’s why.  

In this example, SamosASa is a person who prefers pooPadoms, while SamoSDem prefers Samosa. The question is about what is better, a SamoSaa or a poOPadom. In this case, both options are equally delicious, so the question does't make sense.

"
243,"'one of' their is a relative pronoun, and it can indicate a place or a thing. Based on this, one could assume that 'one' of theirs is either a restaurant or the specialty of a particular restaurant. However, 'of theirs' indicates something else entirely. 
  
  'of their' is used to indicate that something belongs to someone or something, rather than a location. In this case, since the Samosa is something that belongs specifically to a Indian restaurant, we can assume 'their' refers to an Indian Restaurant.

"
244,"Directive is the most general dialogueact. It is used to express a person's wishes, instructions, or requests. 
In this case, ""let's"" is a directive word that indicates the speaker is requesting the listener to do something. 
  
Question is another general type of dialogue acts. In this example, a direct question was asked, but it was also followed by a request for an explanation. The recipient was then asked to give an appropriate explanation or response.

"
245,"""question"" is the most likely dialogueact given the context of asking a person for their preference or preference. 
Over-inform is another likely category, as the question is not asking about a particular item or situation, but rather asking the person to recommend something. 
  Directive is also a possible category given that there is an order to the request, with the first part being the recommendation. Commissive, however, does not seem to apply as there was no promise or commitment made.

"
246,"In this case, it is considered that ""i might"" is an affirmative statement, and therefore the dialogue acts of question and inform are both considered to be present.

"
247,"Question is an interrogative sentence construct that conveys a request for information or clarification. The question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the question is open-ended and invites the listener to supply an answer. 
  
In this case, ""these"" is the interrogatory element, and ""roses"" are the information-requesting element. Therefore, this is classified under question.

"
248,"This text provides information on a commonly-discussed topic: the type of bed that is preferred. The recipient can choose between a regular or an king-sized bed. 
  
It does not ask a direct question: ""is a Queen-Size bed ok?"". Instead, it provides a general answer to the question ""what is the preferred type bed?""

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible dialogue acts for a text: inform(ation), question(ion), directive(ive), commissIVE. 
In your case, inform is most likely the right answer.

"
249,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask for further information, clarification, a response to a point made in the dialogue, etc. The question dialogueact is used in this example because the asker is seeking information regarding the potential problem with a product they are considering purchasing.

"
250,"the text asks for the help of the other person, indicating that it is a directive dialogue
it is unclear whether the question is asked by the asker or the answerer, and therefore it cannot be classified under question
there is no information in the passage that would classify it under inform or question.

"
251,"Question is the most likely dialogue action in the example, as the person is giving instructions or requests. 
Overinform is unlikely, because it is considered rude to ask someone for something they have already agreed to. In this example the listener has agreed with what the asker wants, so it would be overinform to request a different type of beverage. 
  Question: Do you have any preference? 
    Overinformed: No, I would like either a glass of wine, a beer,  or a cocktail.  

Inform is also unlikely in that example. It is rude not to inform someone that you are going to do something, especially if it's a surprise. So the inform action is likely to be question here as well.

"
252,"Inform is a polite way to provide information, so the inform act can reasonably be inferred here. 
Overinform is another way of providing the same information and is less polite. 
 Question is used to seek information 
 Directive is giving instructions 
 Commissive means to make a promise or commitment 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think the dialogue acts of your text are: 

 
inform: ""we’ve managed... in... the... last... two... years.""
question: “we” have “managed...” in “the... factory... over... past... 2...years.”
directive:  “have you... seen... my... company... car?”
commissive : “have... you seen ... my  company...car?”

"
253,"Directive is a type of dialogue acts that guide or instruct the other person. In this case, 'flag down' the waiter is an instruction to do something. 
Question is another type dialogue Acts that ask questions. Here, there is no question in the given text. 
  Instead, this is just a simple statement that provides information. So, overinform and question it.

"
254,"the text is a suggestion rather than a request or command
it does mention rest, but not enough to be considered a recommendation
there is no mention of drinking more fluid, water is an important part of rest

A:
According to the dialogue acts chart, this is commissives: 
""i would recommend that you rest more and also drink water""
So, I would say that it is recommended.

"
255,"Overinform: This text contains too much information for the dialogue acts of question and directive. It is likely that these dialogue Acts will be selected in the conversation. 
  
Question: this is a great text! I can see why it would be classified this way. There is too little information in this passage for question or directive to be the correct dialogue actions. I would expect to see a more definitive statement from this type of text. For example, ""I have run-ny noses, sore throats, and a temp every year. My mom has had one of these every winter since I was a kid."" 
   
Directive: I don't think this would ever be a correct classification. Directives are usually given as a suggestion to do something. In this case, it sounds like the information is being shared to let the person know that they have health issues. So, I think it should be considered informational.

"
256,"Question: This text uses the word ""without"" to indicate a lack of something and is therefore classified in this manner. 
  Inform: There is no indication in the given text that "" without "" indicates a missing element. Therefore, this is classified out of question and inform.

"
257,"This text indicates the need for a more advanced level of writing skill, since it requires the writer to know how to ask for help, give information, make requests, and make commands.

"
258,"Inform is characterized by offering information or guidance to another person. The inform dialogue acts are: question and directive. 
Question is used to seek information and clarification from another. A question dialogueact is formed by asking and answering. For example, ""are you all right?"". 
 Directive is to give orders or instructions to someone. Direct dialogueacts are used when making requests or giving orders. ""Would you like a drink?"" is an example of directive act
 Commissive act includes requests for information, opinions, suggestions, etc. from other person and is the most common.

"
259,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask someone a direct question. In this case, it's asking how the person may help them. 
In this example, ""how may I help"" is a request for assistance.

"
260,"""yes"" is a statement asking the other person a yes/no question. 
the text is asking about a topic that is related to dinner reservations, so it can be classified under directive

I'd love to book a dinner reservation for you at <restaurant name> on <date>.
Would you be free for <dinner date>?
Yes, I'd be happy to join you for diner at the <name of restaurant> at  <date>
Thank you! We'll book the dinner for  the <time> and you'll have the table # <number>

"
261,"Inform: This is a request for general information, so the answer is not expected. 
Question: the question is about a prediction, and the inform is expected to be a yes or no answer. The question therefore indicates a desire for an opinion or prediction. 
  Question is used in a conversation to indicate a need for clarification or an expectation for more information
Directive: this is an instruction, telling someone what to do. It is therefore not appropriate in this context. Commissive is also not suitable, as it implies a relationship of dependency between the two parties, where the commissivity is based on a previous relationship. In this case, it would be appropriate to use commissives such as request, suggestion, or recommendation.  

A:
According to the book ""Text Analysis for the Social Sciences"" by John B. Stallings, there are 4 types of questions:  inform, question,  directive, commisive. The text you provided is actually a commisive text.

"
262,"In the first sentence, 'I'll go check for yourself, Sir.', there is a clear request for the person speaking to go themselves to check something. This indicates the dialogue acts of question and command are more likely. 
However, in the second sentence 'It's completely free,' there does appear to be a confirmation of something, however it is not clear what. The use of 'is' indicates it may be an explanation or clarification, but it could also be the case that 'free' is being used as an adjective to describe something that is already free. In this case, command is more appropriate.

"
263,"In this example, 'would like' is an auxiliary verb, indicating that a request is being made. The request comes from the customer, not the waiter. In this case, we can predict that'reserve a' a commissitive act, because the request requires a follow-up action. 
  
'private dining' could be a noun or a verb. If it's a word, then it could also be an infinitive, but it has to be followed by a direct object. So, either 'a private dinner room' or 'private dinner rooms'. If the latter, this is a gerund, and it requires an indirect object, so 'you'. 
   
If 'dining room', then this could either be the object of a preposition, like 'to dining', or it can be another noun, in which case it would be 'another dining'. Either way, both of these are fine.

"
264,"Out of Commissive, over inform is the next most likely choice. Commissives are used to express strong opinions or commands. In this case, ""make yourself understood"" is an order, and commissives can express orders in a commanding tone of voice. 
Over question is also a possibility. This is because the question marks in this sentence suggest that there may be more than one answer to the query.

"
265,"Question: all right, may I have you name sir,

Statement: yes, you may have my name. 
  Sir is a person's formal title used in British English.

"
266,"Because the provided text does neither ask any question nor give any command or promise to the other party, it is considered an informational exchange between two people. This is because the information provided is not related to any request or need of another person, but is rather a general statement about a situation that does no harm to anyone. Therefore, this is an example of an informative exchange.

"
267,"Inform is the most general dialogue action, and thus the one with the fewest characteristics. Inform can mean either ""provide information"" or ""greeting in an informative manner"". In this case, ""inform"" is most likely a slang term for ""hello"" that has become part of the corporate culture at ivY.

"
268,"Inform is the most general dialogueact, indicating that there is no indication of who is speaking to whom, what is being discussed, who or what the participants are, where the conversation is taking place, etc. Inform acts can also be used as an answer to a previous question or statement, without providing any additional information. 
Question is used when the information provided is insufficient to make a decision about what was being talked about. The question is intended to elicit additional details or clarification from either the questioner or the answerer. 
  Question acts include: ask, tell, ask again, confirm, deny, query, request, order, command, suggestion, advice, recommendation, complaint, inquiry, statement.  
Directive is an indication to another person or entity to take some action. It can include a request for the action to be taken, as well as the giving of instructions to the entity or person to carry out the desired action, such as telling someone to ""go to class."" 

 

 commissIVE indicates a conversation in which one person is making a commitment to do or say something. Commits can take many forms, including promises, requests, orders, suggestions, recommendations, complaints, inquiries, statements, questions.

"
269,"inform: the dialogue acts inform and question are subsumed under inform. The inform dialogue action is used when the information being provided is not new to the listener, and so the question is redundant. 
question: this is the most common use of question in the conversation. A question indicates a need for more information, or that a previously provided piece of information is unclear or incomplete. 
  

You must have been tired after a long flight from Canada. You must feel exhausted.

"
270,"Inform is the default dialogue action for text that seeks information. It indicates the sender is looking for answers to questions and is not making a request or commitment. 
  
Out ofinform is used when the information being sought is outside of what is being requested. For example, if someone asks you for directions to a store, but you know the address of a different store down the street, you would use out ofinformato ask for the directions for store A. If the question is about a topic that is of interest to both the asker and the responder, then the informaion is shared, so the use of outofinform would be less appropriate. However, in the example above, both parties are interested in directions, therefore outofrform would also be appropriate in that case. 
Question is a special case of an inform action. When a person asks a direct question of another, they are seeking information or clarification. The question mark is an indicator that something is up, that there is ambiguity in what the inquirer is trying to convey. In this case, there does not appear to  be any ambiguity, however, this is only an assumption based on what you have provided so far. Please clarify.  If the answer is ""yes"", then there would not be a need for a response. On the flip side, a negative response would indicate that you do not know or cannot answer the inquiry. An affirmative response is also possible, although the response may not fit the form of question that was asked.

"
271,"Directive is a directive or order speech act. In this case, it is used to request a service or action. 
  
  The text: ""believe...tea is...the second...most popular...after water"" indicates the need for a response. The speaker wants to know if the listener agrees with the statement. By using the word ""now"" in this context, he is requesting a now response (i.e. ""yes, that is true""). 
   
In contrast, inform is an informative speech action, used when someone is sharing information, facts, opinions, etc. in a non-commanding manner.

"
272,"In the example provided, ""yes"" is a yes/no question that is answered with a ""yeah, sure"" response. The response is considered to be an informative response because ""it provides the information that yes is the affirmative answer to the question and that the person will be available tomorrow.""

A:
According to this article, there are four possible types of dialogue acts: 
1. Question: This is used when someone asks a direct question.  2. Command: This is when a person orders someone to perform an action or do a certain thing. 3. Request:  This type of act occurs when you need someone else to help you perform a task. 4. Inform: In this case, you are giving information to another person.

"
273,"This text indicates a lack of trust in the receiver, as the sender is not providing any information or providing only partial information. This is a strong indication that they are not being honest with the other person. 
Furthermore, this is an example of a text that is considered to contain a conditional clause, because it is dependent on a future event. The conditional clauses are considered a sign of uncertainty in text and are often used to mask a message of manipulation.

"
274,"Directives are used when the person giving the instruction is trying get someone to do something. In this case, Bill is asking if the host can provide more soup for the guests. 
Questions are when someone is looking for information. The host is inquisitive about whether or not Bill can bring more Soup to the party. 
    
Inform is used to share information that is already known to both parties. Bill already knows that there is enough soup to go around for all 6 guests, so there isn't a need to ask him to bring any more.

"
275,"This text does provide information about the examination that was performed on this young person. 
It also asks a follow-up question about whether the person was able or not able perform the action. 
  
However, it does so in a way that is not typical of a direct question. Instead, this is more of an informational question that provides additional information. In this case, ""he wasn’t able either"" is an answer to the question ""was the exam able for him?"".

"
276,"the text asks a direct question about experience, indicating that it wants the user to provide an answer

'any experience?' is an example of a statement asking for an information response. The user is expected to give an experience of their own in order to answer the question
based on your previous answer, you mentioned that you have no experience working in Advertising. This is not a sufficient answer to the direct and specific question asked, so the response is classified here as directive. 
 
I have experience as an Accountant.

 

 

However, I do not have any specific experience within Adverting. I have worked in many different industries and have had to learn new skills in each industry. Advertising is still a new industry to me, but I believe I am well suited to it as I like to think of myself as being creative and innovative. I am also very detail oriented and like working on complex problems. 
  
 
 


"
277,"Inform is used when the message is not intended to be a request for information. For example, a sender may inform a recipient of an event that is likely to occur in order to provide the receiver with context. 
  
Question is one of four possible dialogue acts, along with directive (request), commissives (command), and question-reply. The recipient's response can either confirm or deny the question; if it does not, then the dialogue is considered to have failed.

"
278,"Question is a sub-category of directive. Directive is subcategory
of commissives. Based on this, we can say that question falls
under directive and not inform.

"
279,"This text uses the word'sir' in a non-verbal context. This is an indicator that this is a social interaction and the person communicating is likely a man and he is addressing a person as 'Sir'. This could be a sign that he's a higher-level manager or someone who has authority over the individual being spoken to. 
  
In this context, 'yes sir' is used as confirmation that what the man is saying is correct.

"
280,"In this example, 'you' is likely a customer service representative (such as a receptionist or a call center agent) who is being asked to share information. As a service agent, this 'customer' would likely have asked the agent to help them with their order or provide some assistance. In this case, it would make sense for the service agents to be instructed to maintain certain qualities, such as punctuality, efficiency, and professionalism. 
  
By sharing the qualities they feel are important for a'secretary' to possess, service representatives could be directing their customers to take action, in this instance, to ensure that their service is received in a timely manner.

"
281,"Overinform: the sender is over-sharing information, providing too much information that is not relevant to the current context. 
Question: there is a request being posed in the message, but the information provided doesnot answer the question. 
  For example, ""why are you late?"". The answer ""i had an accident"" does answer this question but does overinform.  
Directive: a message is characterized by an instruction that requires a response. In this case, someone is being arrested. This is an order that should be followed. However, there isn't any response to this order, therefore it is classified under directive.   
Commissive (or commissarial): a commissario is someone who makes a commitment to take action. Here, it seems like the police officer is making a committment to arrest the suspect. But, since there's no response from the other party, this is also classified in directive category.

"
282,"This text can also be read as a confirmation that 'yes', the dialogue
  act of question is appropriate.

"
283,"Yes, this person studied at a Computer Training Program. 
This text does mention that the person can ""process data"", but it does so through a general statement, not providing any details about how the individual processes data. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, it seems that your model is predicting the wrong dialogue acts for the given example. I would suggest you to check the model's predictions and try to improve the dialog model by looking at the examples that are misclassified.

"
284,"This text indicates the speakers intention of operating these devices. 
  The text 'let me call lost & found' indicates a desire to communicate with others and take an action.  

However, this is not the case for the other two devices, fax machine and duplication machine. These devices are not mentioned in the previous text and the only action the author is expressing is a willingness or intention for others (the speaker or someone else) to operate these machines. In this case, it is an over-informativeness.

"
285,"There is a statement providing a factual piece or information. 
However, there is no question asked, no directive given, nor is there a commissIVE act in this example.

"
286,"Question is a specialised form of dialogue that is used to seek information, make a request, clarify a point, request clarification, ask a direct question or make an inquiry. 
  
Out ofinform is another specialisation of a dialogue form that indicates the information being shared is new to the conversation and is being provided for the first time. 
Overinform indicates information has already been shared in a conversation before, but the receiver has not yet processed it. Inform is the default form.

"
287,"Inform is used to convey information that is not sensitive or confidential. In this case, it is important for Dr. Wang to know that there is another book by the same author called ""The Man and The Sea"" because it could be helpful context for his current research. 
  
Question is often used when the information being conveyed is sensitive and requires confirmation. The recipient needs to confirm that Dr Wang does in fact have this book before they can provide any useful context.

"
288,"Inform is characterized by providing or sharing information without making any request, a commitment or a guarantee. This text contains information that the reader is free to act upon without any requirement or obligation.

"
289,"In the first sentence, 'what'snew' is an open-ended statement, so the answer is not limited to 'the dialogue acts of hi,dan.what'renew?'. Therefore, this is classified in the question category. 
However, in subsequent sentences, it becomes more directive. 'What's the matter?' is more of an ask question than an inform statement. So, we classify this as a direct question rather than a declarative statement (inform).

"
290,"""I've tried to contact you twice in the last two day. Where have  you been?"" is a declarative sentence, and question is the expected dialogueact.

"
291,"Question: I went on a business trip to Salt Lake City. 
Inform: What's going on? 

 

A:

I would say that it's a ""question"" because the person asking the question is expressing an interest in knowing what is going ""on"" (i.e., what the other person is doing).  
""Question"" is one of the four possible labels for a dialogueact, and it can be used to classify a response to a text as a whole.  In this case, ""Question"", along with ""Information Request"", ""Directive"", and ""Committment"" are all possible dialogue acts for the response.

"
292,"In this example, i gotfired is an information provided to you about a past event. The nature and reason of my firing is not being guided or directed towards any specific action or choice, so the act should be classified under inform rather than directive or commissIVE.

"
293,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask questions about something the person is reading or hearing. The question dialogueact is used in this example to find out why the current change of behavior is happening. 
  

A:
According to this page, there are 6 possible responses for a ""question"" dialogue response: question; question question?; answer; explanation; clarification; and clarification clarification.  The response you provided is question.

"
294,"""messed it"" is a transitive verb, therefore the dialogue acts are overinform, overquestion, overtalk, overexplain. 
the ""it"" in ""messing it"", is an object, and therefore it is overobject, ovexplain,overquestion.

"
295,"Question: ""what will you do next?"" is an example of question in the context of information seeking. The question marks in this sentence indicate that there is uncertainty in what the speaker wants to say. In this case, ""do"" is the subject of ""will you"". The speaker is unsure of what they want to convey to their listener, and the uncertainty is conveyed by the question mark.

"
296,"In this example, Lily does not know that Michelle went out of the office to look for work. Lily is simply telling Michelle that she did not tell Lily that they went looking for jobs. This is an example of non-verbal communication, where the nonverBAL message is more important than the verbal message.

"
297,"In the given example, we can see that ""yep, that's the right way"" is an answer to the question ""but what if the chickens don't like it?"". In other words, this is not a valid answer, as it does nothing to clarify the query. 
  
Instead, a better answer would be ""I don’t know. I haven’ll try it out and see."". Here, instead of providing a solution to a problem, our answer simply states that we don' know if this will work, and we will try the method out.

"
298,"Inform is a good dialogue action to use when you are providing information to another person. Inform indicates to your listener that you have something important to communicate, but you do not want to burden them with it. By using inform in this way, you can help them take an interest in what you're saying without making them feel pressured to do or think anything. 
  
Overinform is when a speaker gives too much information, making it difficult for the listener to take the communication in context. For example, if you were giving a sales pitch and said, ""this product is amazing,"" your audience may interpret that as a guarantee that will make them more likely to buy your product. However, your communication may be more like a friendly recommendation, so you should use inform instead. If you overinform, a similar guideline applies: if a listener asks a follow-up question or makes a comment, then you may have overinformed them.

"
299,"Directives are used when the message is not intended to be understood by the recipient, but is meant to convey a request or order to another person or entity. In this case, Lily is the intended recipient of the request. The speaker, however, is asking a friend (i.e., you) to relay the information to Lily. Directives can also be used to express a wish or a suggestion. 
  
Inform is used for conveying information that is intended for another individual or group.  In this example, ""in most cases"" is information intended only for Lily, and is therefore an example of aninform dialogueact.

"
300,"In this example,'she has a right' is a strong indication that this is an example of a directive dialogue. In a direct dialogue, both parties are expected to give their input, whereas in a request-response dialogue the request is the only input from the sender. 
  
  In addition, this sentence is followed by a prediction of the dialogue acts of what will happen next. Based on this, we can conclude that 'this' refers to 'her', and that she will be given a 'right' to something.

"
301,"In the first sentence, ""i've gotten"" is used to indicate that something has happened in the past, so the question mark is added to the end of the sentence to signal that it is being asked. 
""Anything wrong"" in this context is likely to be a negative response to a previous question about the car, indicating that this is not the time to ask about it. 
  

text: i've got a ticket for parking in a no parking zone.  i don't understand why. what should i do? 
 Based on this sentence and the surrounding text (which is about asking a car mechanic about parking tickets), the answer to this question is probably ""get a new car"".

"
302,"This text is seeking information from its recipient, but does not provide enough information to answer the question directly. 
  
  The sender does mention that oolong is healthy, however, they do not mention the specific health effects or provide any references to support their claim. As a result, it is unclear whether the receiver should try ouluong or not.

"
303,"Inform: This is a factual statement that provides information about an event. 
Overinform: In this example, 'In i gota ticket yestaerday', the word 'Yesterday' is repeated too many times. Inform is used instead. 
  Question: this is an interrogative sentence, asking 'why' a particular event occurred.  
  Directive: in this sentence 'Mr. Sandals, your reservations are confirmed', a command is given to the person listening to this message. Commissives are used when a person makes a promise to another person.

"
304,"Question: I got one of these for my birthday. 
Overinform: What do you mean? 

 

Information: One of the sheets from this set. 
  

Questions: Do you like to go on holiday? 
   
Yes, I like traveling. I am a young unwed person. Travelling is no trouble for  me.

  

"
305,"Out ofinform: the parking space is not in a red area, so it should be classified under overinform. 
Question: ""the parking spot is in red, is it ok if i leave my car there?""
Directive:  ""parking in that spot will result in you being towed""
Committive : ""i will not park in this spot again""

"
306,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask someone a direct question. The question in this example is ""why"" you did that. Based on this question and the context of asking this in a meeting, it can be inferred that the answer to this direct query is that you were trying to save time by not having to provide each guest with a set of 6 place cards.

"
307,"Inform is used when someone is providing information to another person. In this case, it appears that the information is that they needed something quick, so the inform dialogue acts are used. 
  
Question is when one person is asking a direct question to a second person, and the second is expected to answer. The question dialogue is overinform, because it goes on too long. However, in this example, there is no second party, only the two people communicating, therefore the question is not applicable. 
Directive is the most common dialogue-act in customer service. It is usually used in a situation where a person needs to make a decision or take an immediate action, based on information provided by another. Here, we can see that a directive dialogue was used, since the customer needed assistance, someone was asked to go to her location to help her,  and she was expected take some action in response to the request.

"
308,"'where'd you parking at?' is a potential question that is not supported by the provided text. 
  The text simply states that the person asked a follow-up question. This is an example of a declarative sentence, in which the main clause contains a statement of fact (the parking location) and a subordinate clause that provides additional information (where the asker parked). 
   
text: ""where’d youpark at?""
dialogue act: question
based on text: where'd  youpark  at? the dialogueact of question hasbeen classified
  as question as the question isnot supportedby theprovided text

the dialogue acts of request, command and promise are not present in thistext. 
request: no text is present to support this dialogue action
command: there is no explicit statement that a directive dialogueaction is intended, however, a request for action is often accompanied by a verb such as said, asked, told, etc. which can be used to form acommand dialogue  action
promise: this is also not explicitly stated in the given text but is one ofthe most common dialogue actions in spoken English. A promise is usually made to do or not do something.

"
309,"Inform is the most common dialogue acts in this context. This text provides information to a listener about where a person is currently located. 
Question is used when the information provided is incomplete or when it requires clarification. In this case, it appears that a speaker wants to provide information but is unsure of the location of a particular building they are in. 
  Question: Where is your apartment? 
   Informed: At my apartments building
  In this example, a dialogue question is needed to clarify the building the person refers to. However, in some cases, Question can be used inappropriately. For example:

A: I'm going to London for a week. Will you come with me? B: London is very far. I can't come. A: Oh, I was hoping you would come!
Here, B is responding to A's question with a Question, even though A is already aware of B's answer.

  Directive is another common dialog act in the context of information transfer.  This text contains a request for direction, assistance, guidance, etc. in finding a type clothing. As the example text does not contain any requests for action, Commissive or Narrative is unlikely. N arrative would require the reader to assume the role of an accomplice to solve the mystery. Commissively, this is simply a narrative text and does no require any additional assumptions from the readers. Therefore, Directive may be a more appropriate classification. 

"
310,"Question: ""Don't  you have  your own  parking spot?"" is asking if the listener has their own spot, and if not, why not. 
  
Out of  inform,  question,   directive,    commissive:  The  speaker is providing  information about their parking situation.  They are not asking, commanding, promising, nor making any requests.

"
311,"""ineeded tobe fast"" indicates the need for speed in the communication. 
Over-informative statements are not helpful in a conversation. They are too much information that is not needed. 
  ""great, we could chat whilst enjoying our cup of coffee at the coffee shop"" is more helpful than ""great! we will have a chat when we are done our coffee"". 
   The latter is too general and does not specify when the chat will take places. It is also too generic and can not be customized to a specific occasion.

"
312,"Lazy is a very negative word and does a disservice to the poor effort you put into this answer. I would encourage you to rephrase this response to show your remorse.

"
313,"Question: the dialogue acts of 'text: how may  i help  you?' are seeking
  information from its recipient. 
Inform: text:  how  may  I help   you? is providing no information and is therefore a non-question dialogue  act. 
  Question, inform: How may I help? does not prompt the  recipient to
provide information; it simply asks a  question.  
Directive: while the'reserving a room' text contains a command, 'How
   may I  help?' is merely giving a directive.   
Commissive  : While the command 'Reserve a Room' is present in the
text,  'how May I Help?' does  not contain a commissitive clause.

"
314,"In this example, 'I'm having trouble' is used as a way to request information. In other words, you are asking the other person for help. 
  
  This is because 'trouble' can be used to describe a situation that is causing difficulty or frustration, so the use of 'Trouble?' is similar to asking someone for clarification.

"
315,"Question is the most likely dialogueact given the nature of the question: ""are  you more a...?"". 
It is also a good guess given that ""a"" is used as a qualifier to introduce a second noun. 
  This is typical of questions, where a word or phrase that may be a noun is qualified by a adjective or adverb to make it clear that what follows is not the actual noun but rather a comparison to something else.  

Directive is another likely guess, given ""follower"" and ""leader"" are likely the topics of conversation. Directives are used when one person is requesting that another person perform or take a specific action.

"
316,"In this case, there is no question or directive in the provided text. The only question is whether the card has actually been charged or not. However, this is not a critical question and is therefore not considered a query. Therefore, it is classified over inform and question.

"
317,"Question dialogue acts are used to express uncertainty or to request clarification. The question in this example is a very direct request, so it does fall into this category. However, there is also a possibility that this is an interrogative sentence, in which case the question mark would be followed by a verb. In this case, we would need to predict the answer to the interrogatives before we can predict which category the dialogue act would fit into.

"
318,"the text asks a clarifying question about what the listener should do with the ""chicken""

A:
According to the model, this is the question: ""What about [the] chicken?"".  The model is interpreting the [ the] as a relative clause, asking for clarification of what [a] the.

"
319,"In this example, 'the charges' are being referred to. The speaker has just mentioned that they bought a certain sheet of paper at the location where the charge was incurred. However, since the context is not clear, we do not know the nature of these charges. Hence, this is a query.

"
320,"Inform is a good dialogue action to use when you are providing general information to someone. Inform acts are often used when someone is trying to find something out, such as a restaurant or a movie. 
  
Question is another good choice when trying ask someone a specific question. Question acts can be used to help someone understand something, as in the example below:

'What is the capital of France?' 
   
Directive is an appropriate choice for giving instructions or directions. Directive acts include giving orders, directions, and warnings. For example, if you were giving directions to a place, you could use the directive action:  'Turn right at the traffic light.' 
    
Commissive can also be a useful choice to make promises or commitments. Commissive actions include asking for permission, suggesting an action, making an offer, etc. If you wanted to ask the person to do something like go to dinner with you, Commissives could be appropriate: 
""Would you go out to eat with me?"" 
     
Overuse of any of these dialogue actions can lead to confusion and miscommunication.

"
321,"Directives are statements that tell someone what to do, what not to, and how to accomplish something. In this example, it appears that a police officer is telling the driver that they have been charged with a crime.

"
322,"Question: This text asks a direct question to Mr Sandal's response. 
Overinform: Mr sandal did not mention a time frame when the investigation will be complete. The response is therefore overinform, as it does provide too much information. 
  Question + Overinform = Error

A:
According to the GPT-3 model, this is the correct response: ""hi mrs sandels. I'm michael, here to help you.""

"
323,"""basicaly"" is an adverb, not a noun, so it is not an independent clause. It is modifying the main clause ""i don't know""
the sentence is basically a statement of fact, and therefore does not require a request for information or a confirmation

A:
According to the Cambridge Dictionary, basically means: in a general way; in substance; as a matter of course. So basically you can drive.

"
324,"Inform (in form of statement, request, suggestion, recommendation) is the most common dialogue acts in this context. The inform dialogueact is used to convey information to the listener. In this example, KARA is a listener, and the inform act conveYS information (about Mike's drugs) to her. 
  
Question (question, inquiry, query, doubt) can be used when the information being conveyed is not clear. For example:

Mike: Do you have any drugs with you?
Kara: No, I don't. I'm on a drug test. 
Here, it's not obvious whether KARAs drugs are present or not. Mike is therefore asking a  question to clarify this point.


Directive (request, order, instruction, command) indicates a request for a response or action. Directive is often used in combination with information, to provide more context or background information. Here, if KAra has drugs, then Mike would like her to share them with him. He is requesting that KArA share her drugs. Commisive acts (commit, agree, permission, acquiesce) are used at the end of a conversation to summarize what was discussed. They are not considered as dialogue Acts. However, they can also be considered a form or a subset of the dialogue Act of question or directive.  

"
325,"Question: the dialogue acts are question and directive. Question is used to seek clarification, while directive is an instruction or order. Based on this, we can say that this is likely a  question. 
  
Directive: there is also commissives, but it's not used in this example. Commissive is often used when someone is giving information or advice. In this case, however, there was no information being given, so commissiv is not applicable.

"
326,"Directive is the most general type of dialogue acts. A directive dialogue
  act is used when the conversation is about taking some action, such as
   ordering someone to do something, making a commitment, asking for
information, etc. 
   
Overinform is another general term for a dialogue action that gives
inappropriate or excessive information. Inform is also a general
dialogue action term that describes when someone is asking questions or
giving information to another person. Question is when a person is
asking a direct question to get an answer. Commissive  is another
general term to describe a type  of dialogue  action that is often used
when someone wants to make an offer or a request.

"
327,"overinform: the classification is over-informing, since the dialogue acts of question and directive are also included in this classification. 
question: it asks a direct question
directive:  it gives a directive
commissive : it makes a committment

A:
According to the GPT-3 model, this is a Question:  why did you stop me?
I think it's a good question!
It's an informative question because it provides context to what happened.  The model is providing context that is not present in plain text.

"
328,"Directive acts are used to request or order someone to do something. In this case, it is requesting or ordering the listener to provide a specific date range for the quoted statement to be true. 
  
Out of directive and out of question: the directive act does not fit in either of these two categories. Directive is a type of act that is used when asking someone for a direction or when giving instructions. Here, there is no question or request. However, this act can fit into the question category if the following is true: there was a request for information or direction, but the information was not provided. If this is the case here, then the act should be classified under question. 
Question acts can be divided into two main categories: question of fact and question for clarification. When a statement contains a fact that can also be answered with another statement, such as ""the temperature is 20 degrees"", then this statement can qualify as a ""question offact"". If the answer to the fact can only be determined by clarifying the original statement or the context, for example, ""which city is that?"", then it should instead be categorized as question clarification, as it requires clarification of the main statement from the surrounding context. ""The temperature in Celsius is 10 degrees"" is an example of such a sentence. As this sentence contains only a factual statement that does have an answer, classification as 'question' is inappropriate.

"
329,"Directive is the most general type of dialogue acts. A directive dialogue
  act expresses a directive command. This type is used for requests,

orders, and invitations. 
  Inform is a less general dialogue action. An inform dialogue  action is
used for providing or providing background information to a
questioner. Question is another less specific dialogue-action
classification. When used in a conversation, a dialogue question is any
request for information that does NOT include a request for action, such
as ""What time is it?"" or ""Where is this place?"". Commands are another type
of dialogue actions, used to express a wish or order to another person.

"
330,"This text is seeking clarification or confirmation from the listener. The
  speaker is asking whether they received the cash or if they should keep

waiting.

"
331,"This text uses the word 'cashing' which is a term associated with
  payday loans, a type of short-term loan that is often associated

pay day loans are a source of financial stress for many Americans
the industry has lobbied to restrict access to the loans to those who are 18 years or older
many states have passed laws to limit access for those under 18
these laws have been challenged in court, but the industry continues to resist
in some cases, payday lenders will not provide a borrower with a pay stub or other documentation to verify age
this is likely why the lender asked for a phone verification of age, to ensure that they are indeed 18 or over
without this verification, they will reject the loan and not give the borrowers the money that was promised
based on this, I predict that this is the commissIVE dialogueact of the conversation.

"
332,"Question is a sub-class of directive. Question asks a direct question to a listener, but does not provide a clear course or direction for action from the questioner. 
  
  In this example, 'why did' is the direct, declarative question from 'you are a cheat.' However, it does little to guide the listener in terms of what to do with the information provided. Therefore, this is classified here as a query.

"
333,"Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the most appropriate. Inform is a polite response that provides information without asking any questions. It is not a request for clarification, a suggestion or an order. Rather, it is an answer to a direct question. 
  
  Out: ""oh,"" ""umm,"" no, thanks.

"
334,"""overinform"": The bank is over-sharing information that is not relevant to the conversation. In this case, it appears that they were sharing information they received from a third party, rather than sharing relevant information themselves. 
  
  ""question"": the question mark indicates the presence of a missing piece to this conversation, i.e. information from the customer.

"
335,"Question is the most common dialogue acts in English. It is used to seek information from a person or entity. The recipient is typically the one who is supposed to provide the answer to the question posed. 
  
  In this case, it is not clear from this sentence who the receiver of information is. However, based on context, we can assume that it could be the bank manager. He is likely the person who will provide an answer regarding room rate.

"
336,"Yes, but... The speaker has provided an answer to the question posed in the previous sentence, ""Why did [they] speedup?"". This answer indicates the information-giving nature of their speech.

"
337,"Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to request something from the listener. In this case, a person or organization. 
In this example, Fred is asking for his $200. Fred has just won a lottery and is in need of financial support to pay off his winnings. 
  

A:
According to the dialogue Acts Glossary, ""directive"" is an act that requests something of a recipient.  ""Inform"" and ""question"" are acts which provide information to a receiver.

"
338,"This text uses the word 'roll' which is a command word. Commands are typically commissives. 
It also uses 'dice' a word that is typically used in aquestion. Questions are usually informatives. 
  So, this is more likely to be a commissIVE than an informative.

"
339,"This text contains a direct request, asking whether this is Professor Clark’s office. 
  This is a strong indicator of a query, because the request is for information. Additionally, this request contains the word “please,” which is often used to request information from someone in a polite manner.

"
340,"This text indicates the preference or desire of professor Clark. The use of ""let's"" indicates a desire to see what the response is.

"
341,"In the beginning of your text ""hi,"" you use the word ""kalina"" to introduce yourself. Kalina is an informal first name, so it seems like you are introducing yourself informally. However, you also use ""literature class"" and ""morning"" in the next sentence, suggesting that you might be formally addressing a group of people. In that case, it would be more appropriate to use a more formal introduction, such as ""Hi, I'm Kalin.""

A:
According to the model, 'yes, John sandal's' is classified inform because it's seeking or asking information.

"
342,"Question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the next sentence is a follow-up question to what was just asked. The question is 'what can you do?'. 
Yes: yes is an affirmative answer to a direct question and can be used to confirm a request or order. 
  In this case, it is used in confirmation of a previous request for weed, 'you wanna Buy some Weed?'

"
343,"Informative text: This text contains information that is not seeking confirmation or opinion from its recipient (i.e. it does not ask a direct question). The sender has a legitimate reason for sharing this piece information, and the information is therefore not over-informative. 
  
Question text : This is a text that contains a request for a response from a person or entity. The request is for an opinion, confirmation, direction, promise, etc. from that person. In this case, it's a statement asking if the skydiver will be unable to attend school. Asking a follow-up question would be overinformational, since the question is redundant to the statement.

"
344,"the text does ask questions, as the first question is 'how are ya?'. However, this is a general greeting, not related to the topic of the conversation. 
there is no command in the dialogue, so question cannot be assigned to this dialogue. 
 the statement is simply sharing personal facts, without making promises or commitments, therefore it should be classed as inform

I'm sorry to hear that. I would like to help in any way I can. Would you like me to call your doctor?

"
345,"In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact category, as the message is expressing gratitude for the good news and sharing an anticipation of a good event. The message does ask one question - ""what type food does he usually eats?"" - but the question is a secondary concern, and the answer to the primary question provided in the preceding paragraph.

"
346,"This text could be interpreted as a request for information, since the question mark is included at the end of the sentence. However, it could also be seen as an invitation to continue a conversation, where the asker is expressing interest in the responder's opinion. 
  
In this case, we predict that this is an ask question dialogue action, because the word ""long"" is being used as the modifier of ""class"", which is the object of a verb. In other words, ""will you [class] be long out [of class]?"". We also predict this dialogue acts because of how the verb ""be"" modifies the adjective ""out"", and because ""of"" can also act as modifiers.

"
347,"In this example, it is not possible to determine the dialogueact from the given context. The only information we have is that there are two possible dialogue acts: inform and question. However, inform is a broader category than question and includes directives, commands, and promises. Therefore, based on this context, we predict that this is an informational text.

"
348,"In this example, Mike is informed about his late friend's reason(s) for not calling back. This is an example of information transfer, where the information is being passed from one person to another.

"
349,"Question: I'm not sure if you called for one, but I do have a service request for plumbing. Would you be able to help me? 
  
  Based On The Text, The Predicted Dialogue Act Is Question.

"
350,"Over-prediction: the dialogue acts question and directive are over-fitted to this example text. The question act does not make sense in this context, since the question is about a request for information, and the directive is not appropriate given that this is an example of poor housekeeping. 
  
Under- prediction: this dialogue is actually question-directive, with the latter being the more appropriate dialogue type. In question direct, a speaker makes a statement that is followed by a direct request from the addressee for a response. Here, however, we have a preface to a discussion of the topic of conversation, followed immediately by the request to tell something of personal significance. While this could be considered a commissIVE act, given the context of an invitation to talk about one’s personal life, this act also fits better with a Q&A format, where the conversation is initiated by asking an open-ended question.

"
351,"'well' is an example of a non-finite clause which can be used to introduce a subordinate clause. In this case, 'it depends' can function as the finite clause that follows it. 
  
  'it' depends 'what is the item' price?

"
352,"Inform is a low-information act, meaning that it is unlikely that a person would use this act in a conversation. The recipient of the message would likely know more about the topic of interest to the senders, and therefore, it would be more likely that they would respond with a response that is overinformative. 
  
Question is an intermediate-level act. It is likely the most common dialogue acts used in conversations. In this case, a 'question' is being asked by the original poster of whether there were any other kinds of tea besides green and black. If the answer is no, then the question is going to be inform. However, if the other kind of Tea is scents, there is the possibility that this is actually a query, as the scENTS are not mentioned in the initial question and the query is for clarification of what is not clear in what was asked.  If the 'other kinds' of Teas are scenting tea, this would make the act question because the asker is looking for information that was not provided.

"
353,"the text suggests that John should have the pipes and fauchet fixed, but doesn’t specify whether John is the one who should pay for it or whether the other person should do it;
it’s unclear whether or not the water not draining completely is a problem; and
there’re several fauctets that need to get fixed.

"
354,"Question dialogue acts are used to seek information from another person, typically to confirm or deny something the sender has said. In this case, it seems that ""are you going to allow me to visit your country?"" is the question the author is asking. 
  
Overinform dialogue Acts are a type of question dialogue that is too broad and does a poor job of communicating the actual question that was asked. The author here overinformed the reader about why they were late, rather than asking the real question.

"
355,"In this example, ""about eighthundred dollars"" is not a detailed request for information, but rather a general statement of fact. The speaker does not ask for details, give a directive or promise, nor does he ask someone else to perform an action. As a result, this is an informational statement and the dialogue acts of ""overinform"", ""question"", and ""commissive"" are not applicable.

"
356,"A:

I think the answer is that it's a direct question - the question mark is part of it.  
In the example, ""anything Wrong with It?"" the word ""wrong"" is the subject of ""it"".  This is typical of questions.

"
357,"""what'swrong"" is the first sentence of an email, and it asks a clarifying question about what the sender is currently feeling or thinking. 
In contrast, ""i’m glad"" to ""help you"" are both non-question statements expressing gratitude.

"
358,"In this example, inform is classified over question and directive and commissives because the message is not seeking confirmation, preference, promise of action, order, request for action or any other type of response. The message simply provides facts about the situation my mother-in-law is in. 
  
  Inform is better than question when the information being shared is factual and does  not require confirmation. In this case, my in-laws are in a hospital. There is no need for my Mother-In-Law to confirm that she is indeed in an hospital, as this is clearly stated in this message.

"
359,"Question: I'm not sure what the problem is. I'll need to understand the context of the situation to be able to provide the appropriate advice. 
  
  Based On: the last part of your message, you shared that there are 3 members in the family of which your father and mother are two. You also mentioned that your mother works as a labourer. Based on this information it seems like there is something wrong in her family.

"
360,"In this example, doctors aren’t sure about the diagnosis, but they know that it’s a very serious disease that can be very dangerous. The speaker isn’tain but is not sure, so they are conveying uncertainty. However, they don’’ t want the patient to travel unaccompanied, because they think it would be dangerous for her to do so. So they suggest that someone stay at the hospital to look after the patients.

"
361,"This text uses the word ""babysitters"" to describe the type of person who would watch your children. This is a strong indication that this is the kind of request that a person would be directed to provide a service for. 
  
  This is an example of how the use of the words ""help"" and ""be helpful"" can be used to predict the dialogue acts in a conversation. In this case, help is used as a verb, and it is asking for help that is being questioned. The question is ""who can help me?"" which can only be answered by someone who can provide assistance.

"
362,"overinform: This text contains more information than is strictly necessary to make the request. For example, Mr Sandal's response indicates he may need overnight accommodations for more than one night. 
  
question: Mr Sanders asks when the requested room would be needed. The question mark indicates uncertainty in MrSandals answer.  This indicates a request for information. 
directive: If Mr Sander's answer is ""yes,"" then a directive dialogue tag is appropriate. If he says ""maybe,"" a commissitive dialogue is more appropriate, as the answer could be ""no"" or ""not now."" 
 commissative: Finally, if MrSander says he does need a room for ""overnight,"" this indicates the need for an immediate action.

"
363,"Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to request a
  specific action or behavior from the other person. For example, you can

direct a waiter to bring you a drink
request your friend to call you back
order your meal from your waiter
tell your colleague to stop talking and listen to you
make a phone call to your spouse
ask your child to clean their room
etc. 
  
In this example the given sentence is asking suzzy to stay in my
   place. Since the sentence doesnot contain any command or promise,
    the predicted dialog act would be directive.

"
364,"This text contains a commissIVE command. A commissitive command is one that asks a listener or reader to perform an action. In this case, Karen is being asked to stop eating poorly. 
  
However, this is not the most common commissative act, so the model is likely over-predicting commissives.

"
365,"Question is the most likely dialogueact here because of two reasons:
1. The speaker (John Sandal) is looking for information from the addressee (the listener)
2. John sandal's reply is a yes or no question

A:

  The text asks a direct question to the person.  It is not a request for confirmation or information, it is an inquiry.

"
366,"Overinform: the author is providing too much information, and this may overwhelm the recipient, who may not understand it. 
Question: this is a request for advice or information. 
  The text also mentions that it's for a few days, so the request is for temporary help.  
Directive:  the author wants the reader to take an action. In this case, it wants you to find a more ""mature"" person to watch the kids.   
Committive : the  author is making an offer or contract.

"
367,"""i trust this girl completely"" indicates the author's level of trust in the person being described. Trust is an important factor in determining the appropriate dialogue acts to use. If the reader does NOT trust the described person, then the writer should use a higher level dialogue action (e.g., question or command) to indicate this. On the contrary, if the character being trusted is someone the audience knows well, such as a friend or family member, a lower level action is more appropriate (such as request or recommendation). 
  
  ""there is this 17 year old girl named sARA RALSTON"" is not a direct question. Rather, it is providing additional information to help the readers understand the context of the conversation. The readers can determine for themselves whether sarasara is the right name for this person. 
   
   ""she is usually this type of worker"" provides additional context to assist the listeners in understanding the situation and the desired outcome.

"
368,"Hank is a person the listener knows well. He is leaving town tonight, so the person speaking is likely asking the friend to join them for a short trip. 
This is an impromptu get-together, rather than a planned event. 
  

I'd love to spend some time with you. I know it's shortnotice, I hope you can join us. We're leaving for alaska tonight and would love for you to come.


* * *
Inform: I'd Like to Talk with Her.  This Is Short Notice,  I Know. But Hank and I Are Leaving Tonight.
 
Question: sour - pepper soup.?
 

"
369,"Overinform: the response conveys more information than is actually necessary, for example, by providing the phone number of a third party. 
Question: there is no clear indication of what the question is, so it's difficult to predict the correct response. 
  For example:

'i hope that she could do this'
or
'she is responsible, but i don't know if she will be able to do that'

"
370,"""i'drather havesomeone a littlolder"" is a request for advice or recommendation. Requests for recommendations are common in conversations, where the asker is looking for someone to make an appropriate decision for them. However, in this case, it seems like the request is more of an expression of gratitude, since the addressee is already aware of the recommendation and is happy to provide it: ""i know you'd bethe best one to talk to about it"".

On the other hand, ""someone older"" could be interpreted as a recommendation, but it could also be a reference to a more distant time in which the conversation took place. In this context, someone older could refer to an older relative, such as one of Jill's parents.

"
371,"Inform is the most common dialogue acts in English. Inform acts convey information without asking a direct question. For example, ""How are you?"" conveys that information by asking an open-ended question without requiring an answer. 
  
Question is another common act in the English language. A question typically requires an affirmative answer before it can be answered. ""Are you going out tonight?"" is an example of a yes/no question that does require an explicit answer from the questioner. 
Directive is used when a person is giving orders to another person. An example is ""Do as I say, not as you do."" This is often used in a business context.  ""Please put the file on your desk by the end of today."" is also an instance of directive. The order is given to the person performing the action, but the order does convey some information. Commisitive is similar to directive in that it conveives information to a third party. However, in this case, a request is being made to someone else. Commissive, on its own, is not a dialogue-act. Rather, this act implies a conversation between two people.

"
372,"Inform is associated more with questions, where as directives are associated
with actions. 
Question is the most likely dialogue
act of your text. Based on this, inform is not the correct classification for this dialogueact. The question is, ""is the person accepting the offer for weed?""

If the answer is yes, then the directive act should be used. If the question remains unanswered, a commissIVE act would be appropriate.

"
373,"Question is seeking two pieces of information: do I really
have all these illegal drugs, and where can I get these from? 
Inform is providing general information, such as ""someone
has to"" pick the manager up at airport, without seeking any
information from recipient. 

 

A:

I would say that the question is: 

 
Do you actually have them all? 
  
Where do  you get  them from? 
   
That's a lot of drugs. Where do   you  get them  from?

"
374,"Question dialogue acts ask for clarification or explanation, whereas 'a beer' is not a specific type of beverage and does  not require explanation. 
In addition, 'what kind' of a beverage is ambiguous and could be answered with a broad range of answers, such as lager, ale, pilsner, stout, porter, etc. 
  This ambiguity is also why this dialogue is classified a 'question' act: the question mark at the end of 'kind' indicates that the answer is open-ended and can range from one type to another.

"
375,"In this example, 'which do  you prefer?' is a statement, not a query. It is an expression of preference, and the answer is provided in the next line. Therefore, this is classified here as a direct question rather than a directive or commissIVE question:

'which beer do I prefer?’
‘beer A and beer B are two different beers, so you can’t compare the two. Choose one.’
This is because a commissived question would be asking the question in a way that implies the opposite of what the statement actually means, such as: ‘Which beer is better than the other?’ or ‘Do you think beer A is worse than beerB?’ In this question the meaning is clear and does not require an explanation.

"
376,"""a Draft beer would be great."" - This text indicates the desire of having a beer. It does ask for something to happen, but it does so in the form of an expression of desire, not a direct order or promise. 
  
  ""I would love a draft Beer.""  - This is an example of sharing knowledge, in this case, that a Draft Beer would indeed be wonderful. The speaker does provide information, and does share their thought, however, this is not an order, nor is it a request.

"
377,"""what the rose would cost you"" is an example of asking information. It is not a directive or a commissIVE. 
the text ""they are only 20 dollars a doze"" has the inform act, because it provides the information of ""20 dollars"" without making any request or promise, so it's an informative statement.

"
378,"the text does not ask a direct question but conveys a request for information (fruit)
it is also not an interrogative sentence, as it does  not contain a subject and verb agreement (i have fruit) 
there is no indication that it should be considered a comment or a suggestion (it's possible i don't have any fruit, but i would like to have it)

"
379," commissives are often used to express a request for another party to take action, such as by a government asking its citizens to vote. In this case, it is unclear whether the commissived text was intended as a suggestion or as an order. If it was an expression of a wish or desire, then it would likely be classified instead as question. 
  
If the suggestion was meant as order, however, than it likely should be considered as directive.

"
380,"""hello"" is a greeting, but it does ask for a reply. 
mr. is an informal title for ""master"", so ""Mr. Black"" would be a more formal title. However, ""how are"" does convey information without asking the questioner to supply it. 
  
In addition, this is the first sentence of the message, where the dialogue acts are predicted. So, based on this, we can assume that this message is asking ""How are You?"".

"
381,"Question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the
  speaker is looking for clarification, rather then providing
information. 
Overinform: this is a strong prediction, but it is not entirely correct. The question marks at both the beginning and end indicate that this sentence is requesting information. 
  The text provides the following information: ""definite nonsmioking, i cant handle the stink."" The information provided is sufficient to answer the query, so the dialogue acts of question and inform are not necessary.

"
382,"Inform is a directive dialogueact, because it is clear from the beginning of text that someone is going tell you something. 
Question is another directive act, since the first sentence of your text is ""i am going..."". 
  The rest of it indicates the question is about yesterday's events.

"
383,"Out ofinform: the taxi driver is thanking the passenger for a pleasant ride. 
Overinform : the dialogue acts out of question (question), directive (command), commissives (promise or pledge) are used in this context. 
  

A:
According to the definition of Dialogue Acts from the OpenAIRE project, there are 6 possible dialogue actions: 

 
out: information, opinion, request, command
over: opinion (too much), question
com: promise (or pledge), command (order)
ind: inform

"
384,"Question: ""howareyougettingalongwithyourbusiness?""
This phrase implies a lack of information, since the question mark is placed at the end of the sentence, making it seem as if there is something the listener should know that they do not. The phrase also implies the presence of uncertainty, because the word ""with"" is used in the middle of ""your business"". This implies there may be something going on with ""business"" that is not clear to both parties. 
  
Over Inform: the use of 'how' indicates the intent of both the asker and the answerer to share information or knowledge. However, in this case, there was no clear need for the information provided, so the inform portion of question was considered to be overused. Additionally, 'with' is often used to indicate a relationship between two entities, such as'my school with students', 'a car with wheels', or 'two friends with different opinions'. In this context, however, it does not appear to apply.

"
385,"the text does ask for more information. it does so by asking ""what the"" roses ""cost"" the buyer. 
this is a typical question asking pattern. 
  the buyer is looking for an accurate answer to a factual question

However, this is also a request for a price quote. which makes this a ""request for inform""

"
386,"Out of the four possible dialogue acts, this is the only one that is neither a request for clarification nor a promise. Instead, it's a statement of fact that the other party can verify for themselves. 
Question: ""What's your name?""
Inform:  ""My name...""
Directive: ""...is dun lin..."" 

 

A:

This is a directive dialogue.  The speaker (D) is giving information to the hearer (H) and is therefore acting as a 'directive' in this conversation.

"
387,"Question is one of the four predicted dialogues acts. The question mark indicates that the information provided is incomplete and the receiver of information is expected to fill in the gaps. In this case, we can assume that 'the toilet' is something the speaker is looking for. 
  
Out ofinform: the question marks indicates the provided information was incomplete. 
Inform: this is an example of providing incomplete information. 'Could i...?' indicates there is more information that needs to be provided.  'Could I have...?', 'Please provide...', or 'Let me know...'. 
 Question: This is another form of incomplete or missing information, 'Where is...?'. This question is asking the other person for information and is considered a form question.

"
388,"In this example, ""toilests"" is a prepositional phrase which modifies ""are fullyoccupied"". The prepositions in this case are ""in therear"" and ""at themoment"". Based on this information alone, we can predict that ""all thetoiless are occupied"" refers to something that is happening at a later time. This is because ""thereart"" in ""rears are full oftoilers atthe moment"" would be a time reference, and the preposed phrase ""oftoilersoftoiling"" modifes the subject of that clause, so the sentence would become ""some ofthetoiled areoccupied at thistime"".

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible answers for a ""question"" based on what comes before it: question; directive; commissives; or inform.  In your example the answer is commissIVE.

"
389,"Overinform: This is a very common mistake that people make when predicting dialogue acts. When predicting the next dialogueact in a conversation, you should not include information that is not relevant to the current topic of conversation. In this case, it would be incorrect to predict that this statement is an informational question because it does NOT ask about the topic at hand, but rather provides additional information regarding a different topic. 
Question: While this is the most common dialogue action, there are other possible dialogue actions that could be appropriate in this context. For example, this could also be a directive or commissivo dialogue. 
  Directive: In some contexts, a direct question can be considered rude. However, in the context of picking someone up at an airport, asking someone to do something is considered more polite. Therefore, direct questions could apply here.  
 Commissive  :  In this example the statement could potentially be classified under commissives, however, given the nature of the conversation and the fact that it's not a request, I classified it as a commissIVE.

"
390,"In this case, ""yes"" is the only option for the first person (the speaker). Therefore the prediction is ""no, there is nothing more"" (inform). However, if the second person had provided a choice, then the dialogue would have been categorized as question or request (question, request).

"
391,"the text does provide specific instructions, by asking the person to go to a certain line at a store to purchase the items needed to wrap a parcel. 
it is a direct question to the listener, asking them to confirm that they are aware that there is more than one category of tea in China.

"
392,"Inform is the dialogue acts that are used when providing information. The example provided in the passage is definitely nonsmooking, i cannot handle the stench. Based on this, inform is most likely the correct classification for this dialogue. 
  
Question is used to seek clarification. ""What does it mean?"" in this case. 
Directive is when you are giving orders. In this example, you have asked for information which was then followed by a request for clarification, "" what does this mean"". 

 

 commissives are when someone makes a pledge or promise.  In this instance, it sounds like the author is making the statement that the listener should eat chicken that has low amounts of fats. However, this is not explicitly stated in order to make this a commissIVE statement, so commissivity is unlikely.

"
393,"This text is requesting information. The line is very long, and the speaker is indicating that the length of time it will take is unknown. Therefore, this is an example of question asking information from the listener. 
  
However, there is no guarantee that this question will be answered. Speakers often use this type of statement to emphasize a point, to make an argument,  or to express frustration. In this case, it may be a rhetorical question intended to draw out an answer.

"
394,"Overinform: the wait time is likely to be longer than expected, since it takes 3 min per listener. 
Question: what is the waiting time? 

 

Directive: you should have arrived at the venue on time, as it will take longer for you to get there if you arrived late. 


 
  

 commissIVE: it might be better to arrive earlier, to avoid the longer wait in case you are late again.

"
395,"In this example, 'how awful!' can also be considered as a comment, and not a direct question. However, even if it is considered a 'question', the context of the conversation (the speaker asking for a view on an invoice) makes it clear that this is not an informational question but rather a declarative statement, asking the recipient of their comment to provide a response.

"
396,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask for information or clarification. In this example, it appears that 'how many' is a request for clarification, as the question mark indicates. 
  
Out of question question dialogue Acts:

question: I want to know how much you would like. 
inform: how are you?  how much? you?
directive: answer the query.    give me the details.  
commissive : tell us what to do.    tell us how to proceed.

"
397,"In this example, we can see that the provided text contains information about a future action. Therefore the dialogue acts of the inform category are over-predicted.

"
398,"This text does ask for a clarification, but it does so by asking a hypothetical question. The question is ""Are you going to send them overseas?"". A question requires a response that is a statement of fact, and the answer to this question depends on whether the writer of these lines is being serious or joking. If the author is joking, then the response should be ""No, I am not going overseas"". If they are being sincere, they should confirm that they will not be sending the person overseas. In this case, it seems that this is an example of being joking and so the dialogue acts question and inform are used.

"
399,"overinform: the dialogue acts are too many, it's not clear which one is the most appropriate. 
question: which category does this belong to? 

 
Question: Which category do these dialogue Acts belong too?
Inform: These dialogue Act are overinform,  question, directiv, commissive.

"
400,"In the first line, ""red"" is a descriptive word that does a good job of describing the dish. ""Red cooked carpet and mushroom"" would be redundant. However, in this line the word ""cooked"" describes the food, so it would make sense to include it. 
""rape"" and ""mushrooms"" are not descriptive words, they are ingredients in a dish that are named after their sexual characteristics. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Stalnaker, there are six basic types of dialogue acts: 

 
Out: This is the default or ordinary case. The speaker is expressing a fact or a comment. For example, “I am hungry.” 

 

Question: In this case, a speaker wants to make sure that someone understands what they have said. They are asking someone else to confirm what has just been said or to explain what it means. “Do you understand what I said?”

 
  
 
Directive: A directive dialogue is used when one person wants another to do something. An example of a direct order is “Clean up the kitchen.”

 
   
  
 

Commissive : A commissitive dialogue occurs when someone wants something from another person. A commissory statement is when a person is asking for something in return for a favor.  “I will buy you a drink if I am elected president.”  

 

 

"
401,"In this example, inform is the correct classification because the main sentiment expressed in the passage is gratitude, and the message is that user can now watch TV. Gratitude is a strong indication that someone is sharing rather then asking or promising information, hence the predict dialogue action isinform.

"
402,"Over-estimating the weight of the item is considered commissIVE, while under-
estimation is over-inform.

"
403,"Question acts are often used to seek clarification or to request an opinion or explanation from another person. In this example, it appears that a person is questioning why the other person sped up, but the actual dialogue acts for this passage are more directive than question acts. 
Directive acts indicate that someone is telling someone else what to do, and commissives are used when someone wants to make a request or instruction to another individual. 
  In this instance, bubble wrapping is being described as a commissIVE act, as the person asking the question is suggesting that they should be bubble wrapped.

"
404,"""yes"" is a statement that can be a response or a follow-up question. In this case, it is being used as a simple response. 
Inform is the most common dialogue-act classification for this type of response (along with ""yes""). 
  

A:
According to the GPT-2 model, this is an example of an ""information"" dialogue.

"
405,"In this example, inform is over-classified because the second half of
  the text (i.e., 'what’s thematter withyou?’) is also a request for
information. The request is not followed immediately by any information
and thus the classification of ‘inform’ is overridden.

"
406,"Question is the most specific dialogue category, meaning it can only be used in a very specific context. In this case, ""what are"" and ""now"" are the specific questions that are being posed to Saliva. ""What are doing"" would be an example of a more general question. 
  
Out of question: ""out"" can be a preposition that can precede a verb, but it cannot be the subject of the sentence. Salivate is not a proper noun, so it does NOT function as a subject. Therefore, out of ""question"", the correct classification for this dialogue is question

Directive: directive is used to describe a conversation in which one person gives orders to another. This is different from Salivation, where Salivia is giving information to Mike
Commissive (or commissarial): commisserial is when one individual makes a request of another, asking them to do something. Mike is asking Salia to pack and move home
Inform: inform is for sharing information or giving advice. The speaker is sharing that they like what they smelled in the kitchen, not asking Mike to smell it, listen to it or do anything else. They are just sharing what is in their mind.

"
407,"Inform: This is a good start, but the question is too general and does not provide enough information to answer it. It is better to ask for more information by using a more specific question such as ""Do you know the name of other tea types besides green,black,and scents?"". 
Question:  The text seems to contain a direct question to the reader.  ""Do  you know other tea types?""  This is an example of a ""question"" in the form of an ""interrogative sentence"" which is formed by asking and answering a declarative question with a yes or no answer. 
  In this case, ""yes"" or ""no"" is replaced with an interrogative word such  as ""know"" and ""other"".  
Directive: Based on this sentence, it appears that there is some form a command or request being made.   ""Cooking now!"" is the command, and the ""answer"" to this command is that ""i'm cooking"". 
 Commissive : This act can also be considered as a form commissives. In this example,  the ""command"" can be interpreted as an order or a suggestion. ""Cook"" could be seen as the suggestion to ""start cooking""  or the action of starting to cook.

"
408,"Question: I don't know if I'm good enough at Cooking to call myself a'Master Chef.' I've dabbled in the kitchen, but I lack the experience and skill to pull off some of those fancy dishes that are shown on TV. 
Inform: No, I am not good. I have never been good, nor do I aspire to become good in this area.

"
409,"Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the closest match to what the dialogue text actually says. The ""i"" in ""studied its"" is an information role, and the ""have"" at the end of ""to run"" indicates the subject of an infinitive verb. Additionally, ""plan to"" and ""run a"" are questions, while ""practise"" suggests a command or order. Therefore, based on these clues, it is likely that this is actually an informative dialogue.

"
410,"Question: the response is asking about a dish that the speaker is currently cooking. 
Overinform: there is no dish mentioned in the previous sentence. 
  Question, Directive: it would be helpful to know what the dish is being cooked at this moment.  
  Directive, Commissive : the listener should prepare the requested dish.

"
411,"Question is used when the information provided is insufficient to make an informed decision. 
In this case, steamer fish is not mentioned. The speaker has provided only a general description of the dish, without providing any specific details. This is an example of question because it is asking for more information, to help make the decision whether to try steamers fish or not.

"
412,"Inform indicates a request for information or clarification. The speaker wants to know what the other person eats. 
Question indicates an attempt to clarify or seek information from the listener. 
  The speaker may be seeking confirmation or an explanation from another.  
Directive indicates the desire for the action to be taken. For example, a person may ask another to do something. Or, another person might be told to go to a certain place. In this case, it is the directive form of the verb.   
Commissive is used to express a wish or desire to commit.

"
413,"""they"" in this sentence is an indirect speech, so the dialogue acts are over-classified as ""indirect speech"".
the text does mention that tea has a lower calories per gram than water, but it does so in a factual way, without asking a query or making a request. 
soy sauce has more calories than rice, it is a matter of taste.

"
414,"'ah' can mean either 'yes' or 'ok'. It can also mean 'well done'. The context does NOT indicate that it means'yes'as the speaker is acknowledging or realizing information. Therefore, it can only mean ok or well done.

"
415,"the text starts with a declarative sentence, ""i mostly eat"", which indicates the information provided is not personal and is generally known by the receiver. 
then the sentence contains a prepositional phrase, 'of', which implies the following information is about a particular thing, rather than a general statement. In this instance, it's clear the 'baked chicken' is a person, so the phrase is interpreted as 'about the person of the baked Chicken'.
finally, there is no mention of 'why' in the rest of text. 
  This implies 'Why did I mostly ate baked chickens?' is what the question is really about.

"
416,"the text is commissively overinformative, seeking to provide as much information as possible;
it is questioning the reason for the action being described (pulling over), which indicates a desire for more information; and
based on this context, a commissIVE response is likely to be more informative and helpful than a directive or question response.

"
417,"Inform (Over Question, Directive, Commisitive) indicates an action is being taken on behalf of the author. In this case, thanks for praising me. I can now watch TV. 
  
Overinform (or Overinform) is a similar concept to inform except that it indicates the action being described is over-the-top or excessive. For example, a person who is very grateful for something you do for them might overinform you by saying that you don't need to say thank you. Instead, they would appreciate you saying thank-you. Over-informing is considered a negative behavior.

"
418,"Question: I try to only eat fruits and vegetables. Is there anything else you are good in cooking?

In this example, there is a direct implication that is being asked. Based on this implication, we predict that there must be something else the respondent is good with cooking. 
  
  The respondent has mentioned steaming fish. This is something that most people are not good  at. So, based on that implication and the mention of steams fish in the response. We predict the question to end with the following dialogue acts:
Out of question: No, I am not particularly good of anything in particular. I just try and do my part to limit my intake of processed foods and try not to overdo it. 
Perhaps you could suggest something? 
   
   The response suggests that they are particularly not very good a cooking anything. However, they do mention that steeping fish is not something most of us are very adept at. In this context, this is the implication being questioned. If the answer is yes, then the next dialogue is likely to contain the instruction or request for the receiver to suggest an item.

"
419,"Inform is a dialogueact that is used when the dialogue partner is getting information from the conversation. In this case, ""i'm good with stewed beef and potato"" would be an example of an inform statement, as it is information being provided to the person who is asking.

"
420,"Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to express instructions or orders to another person. In this case, it's used as a way to request the other person to attend the dinner invitation. 
  

So many [dish]! [next frFriday week] [is my] birthday! I would [like to] invite [you] to [cook] for [my] dinner [party]. [Ok?]
In this example, there is an order or instruction to the invited person (the person who is being invited) to do something. The order is expressed using the directive dialogueact.

"
421,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask questions, and are often followed by a response that provides the answer to the question. In this example, ""why"" is the response to ""it is not a bad opportunity"" - indicating a direct question about the reason why it's not considered a poor opportunity. 
  
In contrast, inform and directive are not followed with a corresponding response. Therefore, it can only be classified a as a query.

"
422,"""i'd rather work together"" is a preference, not a commitment. 
the text does not mention a specific error that occurred, so it is not an inquiry. 
  

A:
According to the dialogue acts dictionary, ""cooperate"" and ""collaborate"", are the sub-act of ""coordinate"".
So, in this case, I would classify it as ""coordinating"" rather than ""directing"" or ""commissive"".

"
423,"In this example, 'it is mypleasure' indicates a high degree of appreciation and gratitude, making it an example of a particularly positive or positive dialogue acts.

"
424,"Question: the dialogue acts of 'roomservice.what cani dofor you?' are seeking information. The person asking the question is likely seeking clarification about what the service provider can do to help them. 
  Inform: this is not a suitable dialogueact for this context, since the information provided is already known to the asker. 
Directive: although the directive dialogue Acts are not suitable for the context of a service request, they are suitable in other contexts, such as when giving instructions to a servant. In this case, however, this dialogue is unlikely to be used in a request context.

"
425,"Question: the laundry has not been sent to the room yet. 
Inform: I asked where my room's laundry is and the staff member responded that they are currently working on it. 
  Question : but you said you would send it this am.  
Directive: please call the front desk and ask them to bring my Room's Laundry to my suite ASAP.

"
426,"'actualty' indicates the question is asked in the past tense, indicating the event has already happened. 
'their' refers to a plural pronoun, so the sentence is asking for clarification on whether the mistake was made on both orders or just one of them. 
  

This is the reason why the answer is 'yes', the order was mistakenly charged as express.

"
427,"the text does share information about express delivery, but it is also providing a recommendation or statement about what to do in this case, so the classification of dialogue acts is incorrect. 
it is asking a direct question about whether the recipient has ordered express, and the answer is yes, since the sender has placed an order.

"
428,"""is a Queen size Bed okay?"" is classified here as a request for a preference. 
the text ""i'd rather work together"" is not classified in this model. 
  This text is an example of a directive dialogueact, where the dialogue acts are commissives.

"
429," commissives are often asking the listener to take some action, such as calling a friend, sending an email, voting, etc. 
They are typically not giving any information or clarification.

"
430,"Directive is a special kind of dialogue acts that are used to request a
  specific action from another person. For example, you might ask someone
to pass you the salt, tell someone to stop talking, order someone else to
stop talking or request someone stop speaking. 
  In this example the person being spoken to is the one who is expected to 
   do the action, but it can also be someone other than the
   speaker.

"
431,"Question: the Text is asking the reader for an assessment of the quality of their own dietary decisions. This is an example of asking an informational question: ""How bad do you think my dietary habits are?"". 
  
Overinform: although the taxi driver is expressing their dissatisfaction with the strike, they are not asking for information. They are instead expressing a personal opinion. 
Opinion: taxi-drivers are striking again because they want more money.  This is the driver's opinion, not a request for facts. Inform is therefore not the correct dialogue action.

"
432,"Directive dialogue acts are used when the sender is trying to get the receiver to perform a certain action. In this case,  the sender wants the recipient to mail the document for him. 
  
Overinform dialogue Acts are when a sender gives too much information to their receiver.  In this example, both the inform and overinform labels could be applied to this dialogue. However, in this context, I believe the over inform label is more appropriate as the information provided is too detailed and unnecessary.

"
433,"Directives are used to tell someone what to (or not to) do. In this case, it's telling the film developer to take the requested action. 
Commissives can also be used as directives, in which case the directive is implied. For example, if the first word of your reply is ""yes,"" the second word is not needed, and the third word would be ""please,"" then the reply would qualify as a commissitive.

"
434,"Inform: This is the default dialogueact for all messages. It indicates the message is not asking for information, but providing information that has already been provided. In this example, ""may ihelp you?"" the user has asked the system to help them by providing their name. 
  Question: In the example provided, there is an interrogation structure starting "" why?"" which indicates this is likely a questioning question from a person seeking an answer. ""Do you have them all?"" is another example of an inquiry which also contains the word "" what"" which can be used as an indicator of asking.  
  Directive: Directive is used when the sender is trying to get the receiver to take an action. This could be a request for action, such as ""call the police"", or a command, like ""stop"". 
    commissIVE: Commissive acts are used for when a message wants to convey a warning, or is meant to make the listener feel bad. For example ""you look terrible"" or ""your driving is terrible"".

"
435,"Directives are statements that are not questions, requests, promises, instructions, etc. They are instead statements meant to guide the listener/reader in some way. 
In this case, filling some gasoline for the car is the directive. The speaker wants the person they're speaking to to fill the gasoline, so they can perform their task of giving the gas to their car.

"
436,"Question acts are used to probe for information or to seek clarification. In this case, it appears that 'which kind' is a question. If the response is 'natural gas', the sender of that message can choose the type of natural gas that they would like to purchase. 
  
Out of question and question acts, Commissive acts indicate that a conversation has reached a point where the participants have agreed on an outcome or action, and the other party is expected to carry out the action agreed upon. The sender is asking for confirmation of their request, so that it can proceed.

"
437,"Inform: This dialogueact is used when the information being provided is not a request for specific action, but is instead to provide general information. 
  
Question: When a speaker seeks confirmation, clarification, etc. of information provided by the hearer.

"
438," commissives are often used when someone is requesting something from another person, and the request is not optional. For example, a commissIVE request might be ""Can you pass the salt?"". In this case, there is no way for the person receiving the commissived request to say ""no, I don't want thesalt"". Therefore the receiver of the Commissive request must comply with the command. 
  
In this example the ""can you"" is a CommissIVE command, because the can is an obligation or requirement, not an option.

"
439,"Directive is the correct classification because this is a statement of intent to do something, rather than a request for information. 
Overinform is another term for directive. This is because there is information in the statement that would be useful to know, such as the willingness to talk. However, this information is presented as a requirement to be fulfilled, not as information that is helpful in understanding the intent of the person speaking. 
  
Question is also the classification for a dialogueact in this case. There is an implied question in ""why"" is this person willing ""to talk"" about financing.

"
440,"overinform: the sender is over-asking for details, and is instead looking for a general response. 
question: there is a gap in the conversation, where the asker is not providing enough information to fully understand what they want. In this case, it is unclear what the question is, or what information is needed to answer it. 
  
  question is out of question: it seems like the inquirer is trying to get information from the listener, but the information being requested is outside of their knowledge or authority. For example, a police officer asking someone if they are under arrest is probably not a good way to start a conversation.

"
441,"the text is suggesting that a specific date be set for a meeting, indicating that it is giving a deadline or a time limit for something to happen
it is asking a question about whether a particular date should be used, suggesting a request for information or direction
this text uses the question mark to introduce a new topic, signaling that something is being discussed or questioned

A:
According to your explanation, there are three possible dialogue acts in this passage: 
1. directive: the dialogue is about giving directions or instructions
2. inform:  the dialogue contains facts that are being shared
3. question: there is a dialogue about asking questions
In your example, ""i will use..."", it seems to be a directive act, because it's about providing instructions.

"
442,"Directive is the most negative dialogue acts. It is used to express a strong instruction or order. The person speaking directive is not neutral and is expressing a command or an order, rather strongly. For example, a person might say ""stop"" when they mean ""slow down"" or ""go to the store"" instead of ""pick up the phone"".

In this case, we can see that this is a directive dialogueact, because the writer is strongly expressing an instruction, order or command. Without telling you, this means that you should accept the offer.

"
443,"Inform is a dialogue-initiating act that conveys information to another party about some aspect of the self or the environment. The act typically occurs when one person is providing knowledge to someone else. 
  
Out ofinform: This is an exclamation point used to emphasize a point or to call attention to something. In this case, out of informs the reader that this is something that was recently bought and is now being offered for sale. 
Question: Question is another dialogue initiating act. Here, a person or entity is requesting information from another.  In this instance, 'Do you have any idea what this costs?', the questioner is inquisitively seeking information.   
Directive: Directive is used when a sender wants another to take an action. 'Buyer beware', is one example of directive communication. Another example is when someone is giving a warning or instruction to a group. ""Pay attention"", ""Watch out!"" are examples of directives.     
Commissive : Commissive acts are used for making commitments or promises. For example, when making an offer or contract. When someone says 'I promise to do X', they are making some sort of promise, usually to themselves.

"
444,"In the above text the word 'we' is used to introduce the subject of the sentence. Based on this, it can be inferred that 'We' refers to the bank and the 'you' in the second sentence refers back to 'us'. Based off this inference, we can conclude that this is the first person singular direct object sentence and that it contains a request for information from the addressee. The request is for more information regarding the other teasts of tea that were not mentioned. In this case,'scented' and 'green' tea.

"
445,"Directive dialogue acts are used to request or order someone to perform an action. In this case, it appears that ""ihope thistransactionwillpavethewayforthefurtherbusinessrelationsbetweenourtwocountries"" is the directive action that should be performed by the receiver. 
  
Overinform dialogueacts are similar to questions in that they seek information from their recipients, but they do not contain a clear question or request for confirmation. Instead, they are more like statements of fact or opinions. The sender of such a message is likely seeking reassurance or approval from its recipient, and therefore it should not be classified a Question. 
Question dialogue Acts are the most common type of dialogue action in English. They are often used in casual conversation to ask questions of another person. A question dialogueact typically begins with the word ""how"" or ""what"", and the question is followed by a request to provide information about the subject of conversation. For example, ""How are you?"" or  ""What is 2 + 2?"".

"
446,"Inform is used to introduce a new topic or issue. In this case, it is being used in order to provide context for the subsequent text. 
Question is another way of asking for information, and it follows the inform pattern. 
  The text ""yep?"" can also be considered a form of question.  
Directive is also another form question and is followed in this instance by the word ""do"". 
 Commissive can only be used when the question is about giving advice or making recommendations. This is not the case in the example provided.

"
447,"Question: No, I haven't seen the new student yet. I'm looking forward seeing her as well. 
In reply, you can provide additional context that may help the receiver make an informed decision. For example, if the question is regarding the student's appearance, provide information on her physical attributes such as height, weight, hair color, etc. If the request is for an introduction, share your relationship with the person, such that the asker can understand your level of familiarity with them.

"
448,"In this example, Michelle is looking for information from Sandal's response. This indicates a need for more context, so the dialogue acts are over-classified as question and inform

A:
According to the model, ""hi mrs sandal"" is the question mark dialogue tag.  ""mr.sandals"" could be the name of the person you are speaking to, but it could also be a title.

"
449,"""i"" is used to introduce a statement or thought
the sentence is requesting information, so ""do you"" would be the correct form of that verb
it is also a request for recommendation, and ""use"" indicates a choice between two or more options

A:
According to this article, there are four possible answers to a ""What about..."" question: ""yes"", ""no"", a short answer, or a long answer.  The short and long answers are usually questions.

"
450,"Directive is a special type of command that conveYS information or instructions to another person. In this case, telling the person how the receiver looks is considered a directive. 
  
Overinform is another special category that describes when a sender gives too much information to a receiver. The receiver may not need or want all the information, and so the message is not received in its entirety.  In this situation, inform is used instead of overinform. 
Question is the third special kind of message that is asked for. A question is usually asked by the one asking it to confirm something. Here, asking how someone looks would be considered as a request for confirmation.

"
451,"She's short is a characteristic statement that does not indicate whether the information is true or false. It is therefore a non-specific statement. 
  
  The classification of the inform dialogue acts is based on whether a statement is specific or non specific. Specific statements indicate that a person, place, or thing has a particular characteristic. Non- specific statements do not. For example, ""she is kind"" is non -specific, while ""women are kind,"" or ""he is tall"" are specific

A:
According to the NLTK Book, you can use the classify_discourse_features method to get the classification for each feature. 
For example: 

 

You can also use this method for your own classification.

"
452,"In the first line, ""she"" is not mentioned. The question mark indicates uncertainty about who ""they"" refers to. 
""They"" are asking a seemingly random question about something that is of no relevance to the conversation. 
  

A:
According to this site, there are 4 possible answers: 

 

She is between 0 and 1.75 feet.

 
 She is 1 foot or more than 1 and a half feet

"
453,"She's about 5 feet is a statement, not a request. 
It's a factual statement about a person's height. 
  It does NOT ask any question.  
  The statement does provide a suggestion or instruction.   

In summary, she's 5'5"" is neither a direct question nor a command. She's statement is more of an observation.

"
454,"""tell me"" is an imperative verb, so the directive act can only be applied to the second person. The first person directive is ""tell her""
the text ""she"" refers to a person, not a place or object, therefore the question act applies

text: ""i don’t think so""

"
455,"Because the first part of her statement, ""her beautiful Brown eyes"", is an observation about something that was already known to the reader. It does not indicate a new or unknown fact. Therefore, it can be classified under inform. 
  
However, if the statement were to appear in a context where it was not clear that this was an already-known fact, then the classification of ""information"" would be questionable.

"
456,"In this example, ""i might have bump into"" is information that is being conveyed to the listener. Therefore, this is an example of an inform text. 
However, based on your analysis, there is also a possibility that ""you might of bump'd into"", which would be a query. This is because there could be the possibility of the two individuals having met previously. If this were the case and the first individual had bumping into the second individual, then this would likely be considered a bump query, as the query is asking about a past event.

"
457,"This text contains a ""are"" clause, suggesting that it is a yes/no question. However, it does not provide enough context to determine whether the question is about whether or not the person the message is from has seen the individual in question before. Without providing more context, we cannot determine the correct dialogueact for the statement, and therefore we classify it as an are you? question

A:
According to the dialogue acts dictionary, ""question"" is the only possible answer.

"
458,"""inform"", as defined by the Microsoft Natural Language Platform, is a dialogue action that indicates sharing of information. In this case, ""they are only 20 dollars a handful"" is information being shared about a price. 
  
  ""overinform,"" as classified by Microsoft, indicates a request for more information than is necessary. The person asking the question is clearly seeking more detailed information then is provided in the initial sentence.

"
459,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask for information or clarification. The speaker wants to know something from the listener. In this case, we do not know what the question is. We only know that there is a request for some kind of information. 
In this example, ""take the Porsche inside"" is the information the person wants. So the answer is ""yes"" - the car is available inside.

"
460,"the text indicates the need for the purchase of insurance by the asker
it also indicates their desire to purchase insurance for themselves

A:
According to your explanation, you are right. The predicted label is direct.

"
461,"Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive: the provided text does ask questions, gives commands, and makes commitments, therefore it belongs to the question dialogue acts. 
Overinform: 45 USD for 3 days is too expensive, thus it cannot be classified under this category

Ah: a short acknowledgement or a realization.

"
462,"In this example,'returning the vehicle in San Francisco' is an action that is being directed to be performed by the addressee. As such, this is a directive dialogueact. 
  
However, there is no indication in the given text that this action is required or expected from either party. In fact, in this case, returning the automobile in SF is not an option. Thus, inform is the most appropriate dialogue action.

"
463,"This text is asking the user to come back to the office in San Francisco. 
  This is a strong request, as the employee is leaving the company.

"
464,"This text indicates the question act because it seeks information or facts from its addressee. ""In americand you you [sic] can returned rental car in diferent cities"" is an example of asking a person a fact. 
  
However, this is not the only reason. There are also other clues in the conversation that indicate the ask question dialogue. For example, in this conversation the addressees are both speaking and listening simultaneously. In addition, there is also a lack of urgency in both the speech and body posture of the speakers.

"
465,"In this example, there is a lack of any indication that Mike is the recipient of the offer. The only indication is in the form of'sir', which could be used to address anyone. Additionally, this is not a request for advice or assistance, as there are no directives or commitments being proposed. 
  

A:
According to your text Mike, I don’t think it’s a Good idea…, he is receiving the information. 
So, according to that text the dialogue acts are inform and question.

"
466," commissives are often used when the conversation is at a stalemate and the other person is unwilling to change their behavior, so the communicator resorts to coercion. 
  
In this case, it seems that carp is the issue. The speaker does not want to give it to the listener, even though the latter has asked for it. So the message is trying to get the carp to go to someone else.

"
467,"This text indicates the person is uncertain about something. The person has asked a leading question to seek clarification. 
""Do you want it?"" is a conditional question that requires a yes or no answer. If the answer is no, then the next part of the question is not asked. ""Sir, do you really want that car?"" would be a better question because it is an affirmative question and does include the phrase ""really.""

"
468,"the text starts with the word ""so"" which indicates a transition between two clauses
""why"" is used as a word to start an interrogation, indicating that this is likely a yes/no question
based on context, it seems like the question is about the girlfriend, so the answer should be ""my girlfriend""

A:
According to your text: ""Thanks so Much"" it's an informational dialogue acts. 
It's not a Question, It's Not A Directive, Commisive And It doesn't have any of the following dialogue Acts: Questioning, Requesting, Advising, Informing.

"
469,"Out of question: the question mark at the end of that sentence indicates the writer is unsure of what to write next, so they're asking for help. 
Over question (question, command): the sentence provides no information that would be useful to a reader, but it does express the author's excitement for the drive, suggesting they are expressing their personal opinion. 
  

It's nice to drive in the country. The scenery is beautiful. There are many interesting sights to see along the way. We could stop at any of several scenic viewpoints. I love driving in nature.


In conclusion, based on this passage, it is not possible to determine the dialogue acts in this example text. However, there are some clues that can help narrow down the possibilities. First, we can see that there is no question in that text; therefore, inform is the most likely dialogueact. Second, although the passage does mention that they look for scenic views, this does provide information to the reader about what scenic viewpoint they could be considering. Therefore, out of scenic, informative, direct, commisive is most like the correct classification. Please let me know if you have any questions about this analysis. 


Here is a link to this conversation: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8x0x4x5x8k0y0kz/Screen%20shot%20208%2c%201942%2000.png?dl=0

"
470,"Question: 2. Where do  you get these from? 
Inform: 1. Do you have them all? 
  Question 2: Yes. 
   Where do I get the drugs from? 
    From my doctor.

"
471,"Directives are used to instruct or allow someone to do something. In this case, Mike is being instructed or allowed to make another go at oolong teas. 
  
Inform is used when someone is sharing information or asking questions. This time, ""can I have a try?"" is interpreted as a request for another chance.

"
472,"the text does not request any information or details from gary, but simply provides him with a factual piece about chINA being home to tea;
while the statement may be providing information, it does so without giving instructions, or requiring any commitment from Gary.

"
473,"the text contains a question mark at the end of a sentence, indicating that the sentence is not finished
based on my understanding of the dialogue acts, a commissIVE text would contain a command (i.e. leave my work tome me), whereas the other dialogue Acts are requests for information (e,g. please) or instructions (do this, don't do that).

"
474,"the text is providing relevant information (i.e. the name of the TV show and the restaurant)
it does NOT ask any question

A:
According to your text the following dialogue acts are possible: 
Question: How?
Inform: Chinese love tea. Some claim that they cannot live with out it
Directive: Give the flowers to her wife
Commissive
These are the possible dialogue Acts for the given Text. 

 
Out of these, only question and inform are directive and commissitive.

"
475,"Directive acts are typically used when someone is requesting a specific action be taken. In this case, it is likely that a commissitive act would be appropriate, such as suggesting a restaurant. 
  
Overinform acts can be used to describe when a person is giving too much information. Here, too little information was given, so a directive act may be more appropriate.

"
476," commissives are used to make requests or demands of the other person. In this case, since the person asking for a trip is the one who is supposed to do it, he is making a commissIVE request. 
overinform,question,directive,commissive: the dialogue acts that are over this threshold are considered as being too directive or too commissve. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Stalnaker, there are 6 possible dialogue actions: 

 

inform: ""why didn't you tell me that?""
question: “why did you do that?”
directly: come here.  (verb + object)
commiserate:  “I’m sorry that happened.”
request: let’s go to that restaurant. (verb) 

 
However, Stallnacker also says that there is no such thing as the ""right"" answer to any question. So, if someone asks you a direct question you can't just answer with a directly. You have to find the right answer for that question in the context of your conversation.

"
477,"Out of question and question are the most similar dialogue acts, so it's difficult to tell which one is being used. However, it seems like the question is used to seek information, while the directive and commissives are used for giving orders.

"
478,"the text does provide information, by stating ""i wouldlike to""
it does ask for information by asking ""some salmon"" and ""a roast"" 
this text doesn’t contain any commands or promises, so it would fall into the directive dialogue category.

"
479,"the text does ask questions, by mentioning the type of food that i am interested in (seafood). 
it also provides a lot of information - the types of seafood, their preparation, etc. 

 

A:

This is an example of a text that is over-predicting a directive dialogue.  The text is asking for a recommendation for what type(s) of foods the person is interested.   The answer is provided, but it is not a direct recommendation. The answer includes a list of types or seafood and a description of how to prepare each type. 
  ""I would recommend the following types for seafood:  
- Shrimping
 - Stir-frying squid
  - Steaming shrimp""
In this example, there is no question asked, no information provided that could be considered a ""question"", and the answer provided is more of an order or recommendation than a dialogue between the two parties.

"
480,"Directive is the most specific dialogue category. A directive act requires the least amount of information to be conveyed. For example, ""Go to the store and buy the ingredients for the cake."" requires no information other than ""the ingredients"" to convey. 
  
Out of directive:

Question: the question mark is used to ask for clarification. ""Do you have the money to buy all these ingredients?""
Command: a directive followed by a comma is followed with a request for a follow-up action.  ""Buy the cakes ingredients, then bring them to me.""
Inform: an inform followed  by a colon is to inform someone of something.   ""The ingredients are: flour, eggs, sugar, milk."" 
 Commisitive: if a verb is in the middle of a sentence, followed immediately by the word ""that,"" then it's a commissitive. The word that is capitalized. In this sentence ""to bring the ingredient to you"" is commissative.

"
481,"Out of directive: the given dialogue acts are more of an order than an apology. 
Over directive and commissives: there is no way to tell from the provided text.

"
482,"In this example, ""let me"" is used as a polite request for the waiter to do something. This is an example of an inform command, where the request is for information. 
  
""In front"" of what? The seafood fridges.

"
483,"This text is asking a person to wait inside a restaurant. This is an order or a request, and commissives are used to make requests.

"
484,"In the given context, deep frying oyster is a good option to try. The deep-frying process helps to remove the oily layer on top of oyster, making it more crunchy. Additionally, oysters are usually cheaper than other types of seafood, so it is also a viable option.

"
485,"Question is the most general type of dialogue acts. It can be used for any type or type-of-information exchange. In this case, it indicates the question of where the speakers want go. 
Inform is used when the information being exchanged is factual or factual-like. The speaker wants to share information that is already known to the other person. They are not asking for information. 
  
Directive is when a person or entity is instructed to do something.  In this example, a waiter is being instructed where to take the customers.   
Commissive indicates when someone is making an agreement or commitment to another person, entity, etc. in a conversation.

"
486,"In this example, 'the hospital' is the topic of conversation. So the inform dialogue acts are question and confirmation. 'The hospital is close to here.' is an example of the question dialogueact, and 'yes, it is. I know. You're absolutely right.' are examples of confirmation dialogueacts.

"
487,"In the example provided, ""get into"" is a request for permission. However, this is followed by a statement that indicates the request has already been granted. Therefore, it is classified under the directive act, as the statement ""I'll get into it"" indicates a future action.

"
488,"Question dialogue acts are used when someone is asking for information, and the information being provided is the answer to the question. In this case, 'how much it will cost?' is a valid question because it is seeking information from the person providing the service. The person answering the query is likely to be a taxi driver, so the taxi service cost is what is being asked about. 
  
Out of question dialogue Acts are when a person is not asking information but is instead giving orders or making promises or commitments. 'May i look the bill?' does NOT fit into this category, as it does ask for permission to look something up, however it also does so in a non-questioning manner.

"
489,"Inform: the texter is providing information to the receiver about a current event without making a request or giving a directive. 
Question: there is a possibility that this information is incorrect or incomplete. In this case, there would be a query from either the sender or the receipent. 
  However, in this example, since the information provided is correct, and there are no requests or directives, then the inform dialogue acts are used.

"
490,"Question is the most common dialogue acts category. When a person is asked a direct question they typically have no idea of the answer and are expected to search for an answer. In this case, based on your prediction, it appears that this person does not know the current time. 
  
Inform is another common dialog act category, and is used when someone is given information but does  not know how to respond. The information is usually provided to a group of people and the person providing the information may not be aware of how their response will be received. For example, a teacher might provide a student with information in class and does NOT expect the student to know if the teacher is looking for a response. 
Directive is yet another commonly used dialogue  act category and indicates a command or order from the one speaking to another.  In this example the  speaker is ordering the server to pay the bill.

"
491,"Inform is used for providing information or updates about someone's situation. This text uses the word ""i"" which suggests that the information is about itself, and not about another person. 
  
Question is often used when someone is asking about information, facts, etc. In this case, it appears that ""things"" are the subject of the question and the ""are going"" is the answer. However, this is just a guess, since the actual dialogue acts for question are out of question: question is out out question; question questioner; and question directive.

"
492,"Because the dialogue acts of the previous two lines are not consistent with the label of directive. The first line provides general information, not a request for a course or action. However, it does suggest a plan or course for action, by suggesting that the speaker drive faster. This is an example of over-classification, as the act does in fact contain a component of question. 
It is also possible that this is not an instruction to the driver, but rather a comment on his driving. In this case, a more appropriate label for this act would be commissive.

"
493," commissives are often used when someone is asking for something, and they want the other person to know that they need something in order to continue the conversation. 
commissives can also be used in a more general way to express requests or instructions. For example, you can commissively ask someone to pass you the salt, even if you have already asked for the pepper.

"
494,"This text uses the word'so' to express agreement with a previous sentence. 
It also uses 'i', which can be used to introduce a direct speech. 
  Based off of these two clues, I predict that this is an inform text.

"
495,"This text contains a direct question. ""where"" is a location word, so it can be considered a ""question"" word. However, ""from"" does nothing to clarify the source of information, as it could be a personal email, a news article, etc. 
  
If we remove ""From"", the question becomes clearer: ""How did you know where I was?"". This is an indirect question that can only be answered by the person asking the query.

"
496,"""it is a good afternoon!"" is an expression of greeting, not a request for information. 
the price is shared without seeking a reply, so it belongs to inform.

"
497,"Inform is used when someone is sharing information or facts about a person, place, event, etc. and is not seeking any kind of assistance. 
Question is the most common dialogueact in requests for service, where someone asks for something to happen or information to occur. In this case, it seems the question is about whether the service person will need to help the customer. 
  Directive is when a request is made to someone to do something. Commisitive is for when the request asks someone for their help in doing something and makes them promise to cooperate. Finally, Commissive asks a follow up question to clarify something that was not clear in the original request.

"
498,"Inform (inform, ask, tell, advise) is used when the sender is providing information to another person, and it can also be used to ask a person for information. In this case, it seems that this is an informational text. 
Question (question, demand, request, inquiry) can be asked by the person receiving the information, but it's not used here. The recipient is not asking for any information; rather, they're simply being told that one has one remaining copy of the tea. 
  
Directive (demand, order, command) indicates a request from one person to a second person that a certain action be taken. Here, there's no question of providing or asking information - the directive act seems to be asking the listener to buy the oolong and compress tea mentioned in the message.

"
499,"This text is a reply to a suggestion or offer from the user. Based on ""no thanks,"" the suggestion was that the two of you go out for coffee. In response the writer says ""oh ummm no."" This can likely be explained as the reply of a person who is declining an invitation or request.

"
500,"In the first sentence, ""the bestquality porcellain"" is an informative statement providing information on a particular type or quality of chinese porridge. 
""the famousegg -shell chine"" can be interpreted as a description of a type/quality of porridges, and is therefore also informative. 
 The second sentence is also informational, since it provides the location of an item of interest.

"
501,"Inform (28%)
Out ofinform (21%), question (5%), directive(5%) and commissives(1%)

"
502,"In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the question is not seeking clarification but rather seeking additional details. However, there is a chance that question could be classified in the next step, so it's best to mention it here.

"
503,"Question is a sub-class of inquiry, and the dialogue acts of 'question' are 'inquiry','request for explanation', and 'interrogation'. The dialogueact of the question in this example is 'questio', which can be translated as 'query'.

In this case, 'where areyou going?' is an inquiry. The speaker wants to know where the other person intends to go. In this context, it is not clear whether the answer will please the listener or the two are simply going to the same place. Therefore, this is classified here as a questio.

"
504,"Inform is used when the information being shared is not particularly important or noteworthy. For example, when sharing the weather report, it may not be particularly noteworthy to share the current temperature or whether it was raining or snowing when you were at the gym. Inform can also be used to describe a situation in which one person is sharing information to another person, but the content of the communication is less important than the fact that someone is communicating at all. 
  
Question is the second most common dialogueact in this conversation. It is often used in a conversation when someone wants to know something from another. A question can be direct or indirect. Direct questions are those that are asked directly to a person. Indirect questions, on average, are more likely to ask someone else. An example of indirect question is ""is it rained today?"". When someone asks a direct question it's usually because they want to find out something that is very important to them. Example: ""Did you lose your job?"" or ""Have you seen my phone?"" Indirection is also used by asking someone a general question like ""how is your day going?"" and then someone responds with ""it's been a rough day."" Indirections are questions that do not seek information from a specific person but instead are general questions about a topic.  Examples of questions like this are ""are there any good restaurants around here?"" ""where is this place?""  Indirections can help someone find an answer to an open question by providing a starting point. If someone says ""why is it so hot in here?"", the answer could be ""the air conditioning is broken"" or it could also say ""this room is hot because we are in the middle of summer.""  In this case, someone would ask ""so why is that?"" The answer would be that it just is. ""That's just the way it goes."" 
 Question is followed in most cases by a reply.

"
505,"Directive is an act that conveys a request or order to another person. In this case, it is likely that 'now,  is a Queen-Size bed' is the request of a person asking another for a preference. 
  
In order for this to qualify as a directive act, there must be a prior request for information from a recipient. The request must not be for the information itself, but rather for someone to make the decision or preference known. If the prior information request is not present, then the act cannot be classified under directive.

"
506,"""yes?"" is an example of an interrogative sentence. An interrogatives sentence contains a yes/no question. In this case, ""yes"" is the yes question word. 
  
  ""yeah?"" and ""yup?"" are other examples of interrogativity. These words are used to confirm or acknowledge information. ""Yeah?"" can also be used as a command.

"
507,"Directive is a directive or order, so the letter sender wants the addressee to do something. 
Overinform is an over-informing directive act, where the message sender provides too much information. In this case, it's likely that this is the first time the writer is sending this message to this recipient, but it could also be that they're oversharing their feelings about how they want to communicate with this person. Either way, this overinform acts is not helpful and could be considered directive. 
  
Question is another type of directive and is used when the asker is looking for a specific response. The question in this example is ""on the way"" - the questioner wants a reply on their way into the building. If the response is negative, then the senders are likely to ask for more information - they don't understand the answer to their question and want more details.  If the reply is positive, than the relationship is likely going to improve and the two parties will be working better together.

"
508,"""yes"" is an answer to a previous question (""yes"", ""no"", or ""maybe""). Therefore the question ""yes I have book..."" is out of order. 
the text does ask for assistance, since the answer is ""booked a  room for..."". 
  The text is not asking a direct question or giving a directive. Rather,  it is sharing details about an upcoming event. As such, this is classified under the inform dialogue.

"
509,"""yes"" is the first affirmative statement in the response. Based on this, and given that the rest of response is about the hotel booking, ""yes,"" when used in this context, is likely to express agreement or confirmation. 
  
  ""so"" indicates a degree of certainty or belief, so ""so, there is some picture in there,"" is also likely an expression of agreement.

"
510,"In the given example, ""i will"" is a future-oriented statement that indicates the intention of performing an action in future, and it is classified here as a commissIVE act, as it contains a conditional clause and a verb that is used to express a wish or a prediction. 
""to mail"" the letter is an imperative action that requires a direct command from the sender. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, you are right. ""I will do that"" can also be classified in commissives.

"
511,"In this example, ""right."" is a statement of fact. Therefore, it is aninform dialogueact. 
China is also a country known for its tea production. However, this is not a request for further information. Rather,it is sharing an established fact without seeking clarification.

"
512,"In this case, ""thankyou verymuch"" is indeed an example of an expressoin of gratitute. However, it does so by expressing gratitude, not by asking for something in return. Therefore, inform is the correct classification.

"
513,"Directives are a type of promise that are used to give instructions to a person or a system. In this case, a user is giving instructions (i.e. ""get it"" for ""the police"") to the system (in this example, getting the phone from the car). This type is used more for giving orders than for sharing personal feelings or information.

"
514," commissives are used when the sender is communicating a request or order to another person. The sender wants the other person to take some action, and so they use the commissIVE form of the verb to communicate this intent. 
  
For example, if the message is sent by email, you could receive a message that reads:

Hi [First Name], 
    
I hope you had a nice weekend. I was hoping to see you at the office on Monday, but unfortunately, things have been a bit hectic and I haven't had time to reschedule. Could you please call me at your earliest convenience to discuss next steps? 
   
Thanks, 
     
[Last Name]
  

"
515,"Directive is the most general type of dialogue acts. It indicates someone is giving orders or requesting action. In this case, it indicates the driver is requesting that another person take them to the hospital, even though the other person does not know how the test went. 
  

Overinform is a type used when someone gives too much information, making it difficult for the receiver to make a decision. The driver in the example provided is overinforming the listener about how they did on their driving exam, so that they can provide feedback or advice. However, this does little to help the patient make the decision to go to hospital themselves. 
Question indicates a request for more information from the opposite party. While the request is for feedback, there is not enough information provided in order to provide that feedback. For example, while the question is ""how did you do?"", the answer is left unstated. Without this information it would be difficult to give an accurate feedback to this person. Therefore, a dialogue action of question has correctly been identified.

"
516,"Inform is a good choice for this dialogueact, since the response is providing straightforward information to another person. However, it is not a directive act because the speaker is trying to persuade the other person to take an action, rather than just providing information. 
Question is another good option, because although the information provided is straightforward, there is an implied request for further information from the receiver. The receiver is being asked a direct question about whether to make the report. 
  Question also has a commissIVE aspect, where the questioner is attempting to compel the answer they desire. In this case, they are asking the police officer to go along with them and make their report, even though the officer does not want to.  
Directive is the best choice, and is used when the asker wants the responder to perform an immediate action. For example, if the Police officer asks the do-not-report person, ""Do it!"", then the ""it"" is clear and unambiguous.

"
517,"the text could be considered to contain a request for information, since the person being addressed is asking for a delay in order to wait for help from the authorities;
it could also be classified under question because there is an implied question in the statement ""i'm hurt, can we wait?""; 
directive is another possible classification, because of the clear command given to the injured person to ""put their hand behind the head"";
commissive could potentially be applied, but only if the injury is mentioned and the dialogue acts of both the victim and perpetrator are considered.

"
518,"In this example, we can see that there is an offer of an alternative action, suggesting that someone should do something. The offer is made to someone who is in a difficult situation, and the suggestion is to help them out. In this particular case the person who received the offer was in the car, so the suggested action was to call a phone that was nearby.

"
519,"Inform acts are positive or neutral statements that provide no information or only limited information about the feelings, thoughts, opinions, and intentions of a speaker. They are not questions, orders, requests, complaints, apologies, condolences, invitations, suggestions, directions, confessions, promises, inquiries, questions or requests for information (Wikipedia). 
  

This text provides no additional information beyond what was already provided in the question: ""is a Queen-sized bed ok?"". 
   
Overinform, overquestion, overtalk, overexplain, overload the inform part of your brain with too much information and you lose sight of what is important.


Question dialogue acts include statements of inquiry, request, command, order, suggestion, direction, complaint, apology, congratulations, inquiry for clarification, query, comment, recommendation, advice, endorsement, appeal, invitation, proposal, offer, entreaty, plea, petition, demand, exhortation, call to action and request for action (wikipedia).

  The text of ""it hurts"" does include a statement of complaint or request. However, it does so in a way that is more like a recommendation or advice. The speaker is offering their opinion about a matter that may be of interest to the reader. Therefore, this is classified under advise.  

 The dialogueact of 'it truly hurts' has also been categorized under question as the statement is of an inquiry or query. 'It truly' is an expression of doubt or uncertainty. A query is 'a question posed to a source for an answer'.

 This text contains a complaint and a query:  'it hurt's and 'what is the source of my pain?'

 Overquestion dialogue Acts include questions that are too general or too specific. General questions are often used when the answer can be found by consulting a reference or by using common sense. Specific questions seek an immediate answer, such as 'is it hot in here?' or 'are you there?'. Overtalk dialogueacts include greetings, goodbyes, hellos, introductions and other social greet-and-goodby dialogues. Explanations and explanations are a form of overtALK. Overload the explain part  of your  brain with information so you don't hear what you want to hear. (wiki)

 'Is a queens size ok?' is asking the listener a general question that can easily be answered by looking up a standard size chart. While the response may not be applicable to every person, there is no need to provide a detailed explanation. In contrast, 'I like it when you sing in my room' could be considered as a specific question which requires a more detailed response. As the singer is in control of when and where the song is sung, they can choose to sing it in another room if they do not like being in their room. If the person does like to have their song sung in that room, then it would be a good idea to ask them if it will be ok to do so. So the explanation is required to make sure the request is fulfilled. 


Directive dialogueActs include orders or instructions. These are usually given by a superior to an inferior, but can also be given to someone who is unable to give an order or instruction. Commands are orders given for the benefit of others, not for self-benefit. For example, a teacher might order a student to sit down, stand up, turn around, etc. An order is also given when a person or thing is to take action or perform a task. Orders are given with a sense of urgency, for example 'get the money now'. Commendations are similar to orders but are more of praise, e.g. ""that was a great idea"". (wikipdia)
  This dialogue is about ordering a bed size. Based on this, we can classify it as directive. Also, since the order comes from a higher authority, i.e. the bed store, I would say it's a command. Lastly, because the command is given in order to benefit the store (i. e., to order the size of bed), it can classified also as command

"
520,"""yes"" is an answer to the question ""maybe it doesn't hurt that much.""
the text is asking another question (""what i meant to say is that if i drive just like that, i will get to used it and won't feel the pain anymore"").

text: ""i think you should drive slower next time."" 
based on this, I think the dialogue acts in this example are question and directive.

"
521,"Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both correct. Question is the most common dialogueact in English, so inform is overinform. 
Underinform the other dialogueacts: inform does cover the possibility of the question and directive. However, inform covers this possibility only when the context does NOT suggest that a directive is being asked for. In this case, a direct order is clearly being requested.

"
522,"It appears that the writer of these lines is providing or clarifying information. The lines 'i’m afraid...the police...you will...see that...it wasn’t.' are likely providing clarifications or explanations for the events that have just taken place. 
  
  The lines ‘i‘m going...don’’T...move that…arm while…‘ are also likely clarifies or explains something. This line could be interpreted as a warning to the person who is holding the arm not to move it while the author is gone, but it could also be read as the warning that while he is away, he should not move the hand holding his arm.

"
523,"In this case, ""to heck with"" is an information statement, not a request or command. Therefore, it was classified under inform. 
If the dialogue acts had been question or directive or commissIVE, then the classification would have been incorrect.

"
524,"In the beginning of the conversation, it provides information about where Vane Theater is located. 
Later on, when the customer asks for a reservation, VANE Theater provides the service requested. 
  

A:
According to the Stanford Corenlp natural language processing toolkit, ""question"" is a subcategory of ""inform"" that includes questions that are not seeking information, but rather asking about information that is already known.

"
525,"Question: This text is asking the user a direct question about what is on television this upcoming weekend. 
  
Overinform: the dialogue acts are question and question are overinform. The question act should be used when the information provided is not sufficient to make an assessment, while the questionact is used for questions that are too specific or detailed. In this case, it is likely that there is a specific opera on TV this coming weekend, but the details of the opera are unknown to me. Therefore, this is an over-specific question. 
question: what’s on  this weekend?, overquestion, what are on, question is over, specific, opera, coming, weekend
Directive: this act can be use when a speaker wants to give an order or request. However, in this context, there isn't a request for a service or action, so this directive act cannot be applied.  Instead, a commissives act could be appropriate. Commissives are used to request a favor or service from another person. For example, ""Would you mind doing me a small favor?""
Commissive : Would you do me the favor of watching  a Chinese opera this Saturday night? 
 Commissive is the most appropriate dialogue action in the example above.

"
526,"the text provides details of a food, suggesting that the speaker is sharing information rather than asking for or giving direction. 
it is a performance of an operatic piece, so it is likely that there would be singing and dancing. This could be seen as a direct question or directive. However, it does provide information, as the singer will perform a song about rape and cooking mushrooms, both of which are not commonly associated with opera.

"
527,"Directive is the most general dialogueact. It is used to express a request for action or a direction to follow. 
In this case, it's used as a way to request information from a person. 
  ""Can you  tell me  about the  one on  saturday?""

Question is another general category of dialogue acts. In this example,  it is being used by the person asking the question to seek information.  
""What about  the  chicken?"" is  a question  being asked by  someone.

"
528,"This text does not contain a request for clarification, additional
  information, an order, a directive or a commissivo dialogue acts. It
only contains information that is already known to the reader. 
However, this does appear to ask two separate questions, ""are you
    sure?"" followed by ""there are no outlets."" This is an example of
question-asking, where the question is asked in the context of seeking
information from another person.

"
529,"Inform is used in the beginning of the conversation to provide basic information to the receiver. 
Question is then used to seek information from receiver, and inform is no longer needed. 
  
Directive is when the speaker makes a commitment or promise to do something. In this case, it's the opposite, since the inform and question are seeking and receiving information. Directive can be used when you are asking someone to perform an action.  For example, ""Please pass the salt"" or ""Drive faster"".
Commissives are when someone makes an offer or a gift to another person. This is also not applicable in this example.

"
530,"""reserved opera"" is an indication of a certain level of formality, so the dialogue acts of ""reserved operas"" are usually reserved. 
the text is about a musical, therefore it is likely that ""the monkey"" refers to a character in the musical. If so, then the question mark in ""how are the the monkeys?"" indicates the character is being questioned about his/her/their well being. 
  

I hope this helps!

"
531,"""yep"" can also be understood as a confirmation of what was just mentioned, so inform is not the correct dialogueact. 
the question marks in ""y'know"" and ""you know"" indicate that this is a yes-or-no question. so question is the incorrect dialogue action. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, inform can not be the right dialogue acts for the following text: 「y’know」 and「youknow 」.  The first one is an affirmative answer, and the second one means ""yes, I know"".  So, you are right that question and question-answer are the wrong dialogue actions for these two words.

"
532,"Inform is the most general dialogue action category. Inform acts convey information about something, such as 'the weather in london', 'what time is dinner', or 'where is my wallet?', and are used for both informational and questioning purposes. 
  
Question is another general category for conveying information and asking questions. A question is typically asked by the person asking the question to get information that will help them answer the  question. For example, a person might ask another person, ""Where is your wallet?"". The person answering the query, in this case the wallet, is being questioned. 
Directive is used when someone is giving orders. An order is usually given by a superior to an inferior for the inferior to follow. So, if I were to give an order to you, my superior, I would say,  ""Do this for me."" A directive is given to someone who is not the asker or receiver of the order. If I was to ask you to do something for my wife, she would be the receiver and superior of my request. Commissive, like the word itself, implies a request to commit. Someone who asks to 'commit' something is commissing it. Committing something implies that you are going to start something right now, so if someone were asking you 'will you commit to going out to dinner with me tonight?' they are commisscing you going on a date.

"
533,"Question is one of the most common dialogue acts. When used correctly, it can help the conversation flow and help you understand the other person's perspective. However, when used incorrectly, such as in this case, where it's used to describe a simple request, this can lead to misunderstanding and miscommunication. In this example, ""question"" is being used as a verb, and it means to ask the same question over and over again. The speaker was asking the question ""how much"" the ""ticket"" was, indicating that they were confused about the price of it.

"
534,"Overinform: the price of the tickets varies depending on which seats you are booking, so the information provided is over-inclusive. 
Question: is the question of whether the prices vary according the seat or not? If the answer is yes, then the response is considered to be a direct question and overinform. If it's no, than the dialog act classification is correct. 
  
Directive: it seems like the server should be able to provide the bill to this user. The server is likely an employee of a company that is providing the service, not a random person. So the request for a bill is probably a command from a higher authority, such as the company owner. Therefore, it makes sense that the command is categorized as directive.

"
535,"Question: This text is asking the receiver for their preference regarding the type of bed. 
Overinform: the dialogue acts are inform and question are overused and can be misleading. 
  Question is used too often in text classification. It is more of a yes/no question than a prediction. Inform is the correct choice here.

"
536,"Directive is the most common dialogue acts in customer service. It is used when the agent is giving instructions or directions to a person or group. 
  
  In this example, ""a preparative meeting"" is being given to ""this afternoon"" at ""2:00"". The agent wants the person to attend the meeting, but does not want to specify the location or time. In this case, it would be considered a command.

"
537,"""directive"" is the most general dialogueact, corresponding to any request or order from a human. In this case, ""direct"" means ""to come"" and ""indirect"" meaning ""request information from another person"".

In addition, this is an example of "" commissives"", which are requests or orders that are conditional on another action or event. ""commissive"", in this context, means that ""2:00 is unavailable"". ""unavailable"" can also be translated as ""not available"", but ""is unavailable"" would be a more precise translation.

"
538,"Question: the dialogue acts of 'how muchtime arewe going toowork onthis?' are more closely aligned with question than with inform or directive. 'How muchtimetoworkonthis?', when asked, is a statement that invites a response. Therefore, it most closely resembles a query. 
  
Inform:  'yourthroatisinflamedandyourtonguetippedyouhaveallthesymptomsofinfluenza.' is an informational statement.  It does no more than provide information, and does so without asking or directing the listener to do anything. Inform is the most appropriate dialogue action for this type of text.

"
539,"Inform is used when the message is providing background information, such as the weather, time of day, etc. 
Overinform is when a message uses too many informations. For example, if a person is giving a tour of a museum and says, ""this is the dinosaur hall, this is where the Tyrannosaurus rex was found,"" overinform would be to say, “this room is huge, you can see a T-Rex right in this room.”
Question is  used when asking questions. ""Do you want to go to the museum or the aquarium?""
Directive is use when giving orders.  ""Pick up your toys from your room.""
Commissive  is used for promises.   ""I will buy you a ice cream cone after dinner.""

"
540,"Question: I would like some dressing on my salad. 
Response: Thank you, I'll have some Ranch. 
  

In this example, since the question is asking for a specific type of dressing, which is not mentioned in the previous text and is therefore not covered by the inform dialogue action, a new category of question has appeared.

"
541,"Directives are used when someone is requesting or commanding someone else to perform an action. In this case, a directive dialogue acts would be Commissive (requesting or ordering someone) or Directive(telling someone what to DO). 
  
In this example, there are two possible Commissives:
1. 'dunlin, i think its over 5 meters, I can’t remember for sure, but i believe its maximum length is 200km/h. Would you be so kind as to check for me?' 
2.  'dunnlin please check the following object for length: it’s over5 meters. It’ s maximum height 200 km/hr. Please note that this speed is approximate, it may have been updated.' 
   
There are also two potential Directives in this message: 

 

A directive is used to tell someone something to Do. Here, two directives are possible:

  1) 'Please note the speed provided is an approximate speed. I will provide you with the exact speed once you have checked the given object.' 

 
or

 2)  'dun lin, could you please provide me with your account details so that I may transfer some funds to your bank account?'

"
542,"In this example, inform is the correct classification because the
  speaker is sharing specific, general, and up-to-date information,
without asking any questions or giving any instructions. Question is
the classification for the second part of the response because it
seems like the question is asking about something, specifically, if
someone needs assistance.

"
543,"In this example, ""have you heard"" is an interrogative statement, and the response ""no, I haven't"" was the only response the system could predict. The response was not informative, because it did not provide any additional information to the person asking the question. It was also not a request for information, since the statement was a negative response. Finally, it was neither a direct command nor a commissivo dialogue.

"
544,"This text is asking the user if they have anything more to say. The question mark indicates the dialogue acts are in doubt. 
  
  Based off the given context, this appears as a question. However, based on what was said before, there is a strong possibility that this is an informational statement, and not a dialogue statement at all.

"
545,"In French, a dialogue acts as a request for information from the other person. Inform is used when you want to know something, but you do not want the information to be a directive or a commissivo. For example, if you ask someone for directions, and they tell you where to go, this is a inform request. If they say 'turn left at the corner', this would be an instructo, whereas if they said 'you have to turn left there', it would a direct question. 
When a text acts like an interrogative, it usually means that the author is trying to find out something about you. An interrogatives is usually a declarative if the answer is 'yes', but can also be question if it's 'why', 'how', or 'who'. 

 

A:

I would say that it depends on how you interpret the context.  If you are in a car and the driver is talking to you, then I would classify it as question or directive.   If the car is driving and you were just looking out the window, I might classify this as information.

"
546,"In this example, ""i need"" is a request for something that is essential to human survival. The speaker, in this case, is asking for food. ""I really"" indicates that this is an imperative statement, which means that it is to be followed without question. In this context, this statement is not a recommendation or suggestion, but a demand. 
  
""I need some"" can also be considered a plea, where the request is for a favor or benefit. However, here, there is no indication that a benefit is expected in return for the food, so this interpretation is unlikely.

"
547,"This text contains a direct question: what vegetable would the person like to eat? 
However, it also contains information being sought from its recipient: What vegetables do I like?. This is a conditional question which requires the answer to be provided before the question can be answered.  This is an example of a ""wh-question"" which can occur in English. 
 Wh-questions are questions that contain a word or words that are expected but are omitted in the sentence. For example, in this sentence, 'Do you have any children?', the expected word is 'have', but the actual word used is the word 'children'. Wh-words are often omitted because they are assumed to occur automatically.

"
548," spinach is mentioned in the first sentence, so it could be classified inform. However, it's mentioned twice in a short span of time, making it hard to process. 
the spinach could also be considered a Commissive because the sentence implies a request or an order, but the order is unclear. 
  

text: ""these spinach should be eaten right now.""
based on this, I predict the dialogue acts as question (question, inform), because there is information provided (the text should) and a lack of directive or commissives in this sentence.

"
549,"In this case, ""something to eat?"" is a request for food, so the dialogue acts are question and directive. 
  
However, if the food is not available, then the question will be changed to a commissIVE one.

"
550,"Inform is a polite way of providing someone with information without committing to it. In this case, ""a beer"" is not a specific choice that needs to be made, so the inform act seems more appropriate. 
  
overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both considered to fit here. question is used to ask someone a direct question. inform is considered when providing general information, but not when asking for specific details. 
question: I don't know if this is an ask or a tell. I think this could be a ask, because it's asking someone to do something, and the ask act could fit. However, I could also be wrong, since the tell act also seems like it could apply.

"
551,"Inform is a prediction of a human conversation based on a paragraph of text. Inform indicates the conversation will be mostly about information-giving and question-asking. The example text you provided is not a conversation, so inform does not apply. 
Question is another prediction model, and it also does a good job at predicting the question asked in a dialogue. However, it does poorly at identifying question asking as a direction. 
  
Directive is the prediction for this example. Based on your explanation, we believe the directive label is correct. A directive dialogue acts indicates someone is asking someone else to do something, or giving instructions to another person.

"
552,"In the beginning of the message, there is no indication that a follow-up question is expected. The speaker simply wants to know if the recipient would like some beer. This is an indication of an inform dialogue acts. 
However, when the beer is mentioned, a direct question arises. In this case, ""would like"" is followed by a time expression, and the question becomes more direct. ""Would you please like more of my beer?"". Here, we can see that there are commands and promises in the sentence. 
  

A:
According to this article, you can use the predict_dialogue_act function from the nltk library to get the classification of each text.

"
553,"In the beginning of the paragraph, it's mentioned that 'the bag was stolen'. This indicates the bag has probably been stolen, and the person is expressing their regret and asking the customer to accept their bill. 
  
However, at the end of paragraph 2, when the bill is mentioned, this indicates a shift in the conversation, where now the focus is on getting the payment. The person has already expressed their apology, but now they are asking to pay the amount. In this case, we can identify the directive dialogue acts as overinform, overquestion, order, command.

"
554,"This text is a request for information, so it is classified under the question dialogueact. However, it does so in the form of a command, indicating that it should be treated as a directive. This is because the command form is used to convey a direct order, rather than a statement of fact. 
Of course, please (verb) wait (infinitive). I'll ( verb) go ( infinitive) and ( infinitve) get ( noun) it ( adjective).

"
555,"Inform is a good dialogue action to use when providing or sharing information. The information provided in this example is about an individual's test results, so Inform would be a suitable action.

"
556,"Directives are instructions that are given to someone to carry out an act. In this case, George is asking for advice for a future job. 
  
Questions are statements that invite a response from the other person. The question mark in this sentence indicates a potential question. However, since the dialogue acts of 'asking for advise' and 'have a  job interview' are commissives, there is no response that can be given. Hence, this is a non-sequitur, and the answer is not provided.

"
557,"""job interviewer"" is a person in a position of authority, so it is likely that this person would be in charge of evaluating the candidate's performance and would make a judgement call about whether or not the given excuse is valid. 
the text ""arrives ten min after appointed"" indicates a high level of urgency, as the person who is supposed to receive the applicant is waiting for a long time. 
                                                                   therefore, this dialogue acts as a directive dialogueact, because it conveys a message to the interlocutor to take some action.

"
558,"Mike is expressing his identity by introducing self to the hearer. 
He is also sharing information from his memory about an important object in the context of the conversation.

"
559,"'directive' is the most appropriate dialogueact for this sentence. 'direct' means 'to go to a place, person, etc. and tell them to do something', and 'face' indicates 'the action of looking at someone or something'. In this context, 'you should arrive at least an hour early' tells the employee to go and face the problem of arriving early.

"
560,"In the given context, 'try mybest' is a request for advice or encouragement. This is an example of a directive dialogueact, as it conveys a message to the listener. 
  
  In contrast, inform is used when the speaker is providing or sharing general information. Inform acts are most often used in the context of questions, where the information is being sought.

"
561,"the text “here is” provides a piece of useful information, so it’s an example of a inform act
it does  not ask any question or give any command or promise so this is an instance of  an inform  act
“ah.” can also be an acknowledgement of what has just been said, and it can fit in either the question  or the  inform category

"
562,"Inform is a less assertive form of communication than question or command, and is used when the sender is providing information to the receiver. Inform can also be used to ask for information. 
  
Question is the most assertiveness form, used for asking questions. It is also used in requests for clarification or confirmation. Commands are used by the person speaking to request a specific action from another person. Commissives are a combination of question and command. For example, a commissIVE statement is one that is both a request for confirmation and a command at once.

"
563,"the text ""agood restis allyou need"" is asking information, seeking recommendation, so the dialogueact should be question;
""i'llwrite youaprescription"" indicates a commitment, therefore the act shouldbe directive; and
avoiding theextremes ofa tooelaborate ortoocasual style puts the interviewee onthe samelevel asother applicants, thus the action should also be commissiveso theintervieWEe is placed on an equal footing with othercandidates.

"
564,"Overinform: This classification is used when the information provided is too much or too little. 
Question: Is the question posed to the listener? Does the person asking the questions understand the answer?
Directive: Does this person ask you to do something? 

 

 commissives: Are the instructions given to you? 
  

In this case, I think the inform classification fits better than the overinform or question classification. The speaker does not appear to have any question or concern about what the other person is wearing, but is simply sharing that she likes to wear t-shirts and  jeans. This is not a request for the recipient to change their clothing, nor is it an order to anyone to provide information. It is merely a sharing of personal preferences.

"
565,"the text provides information to the effect that it's important to dress professionally for the interview, but it doesn't ask for specific advice on how to do so. 
it's not clear whether the person is being asked to participate in the conversation or is just being told what to expect. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, you have classified the dialogue acts as: 

 

Inform: It doesnot ask any question, it provides some information.  Question: it asks some question. Directive: the  speaker is telling the other person what they should do. Commissive : the the two persons are involved in a conversation and they have agreed on a course of action.

"
566,"It is providing specific, but not excessive, information. The cost is not a big deal, so the information is expected. 
Although the dialogue acts are over-classified, it does provide a useful explanation.

"
567,"I misinterpreted the clothes as a sign of incompetence or lack of understanding of what is expected of me at work. 
Clothes that are expensive or of high quality suggest to others that one is well off, so I interpreted the question as an accusation of my lack in financial status. 
  
In addition, I was surprised by the inquiry, because I thought that was the point of such clothes.

"
568,"""i ought"" is an example of an adverb, a word that describes or limits the meaning of another word. In this case, ""ought"" limits or restricts the directive nature of the inform statement, by suggesting that there is a time when it would be appropriate to put on a particular set of clothes.

"
569,"inform is used to provide information that is not already known to the listener. In this example, it seems that ""oyul"" is an unknown tea that was mentioned in the previous sentence. Therefore, inform is being used here to inform the interviewee of an item that they were not previously made aware of. 
question is another way of asking a yes/no question. Here, oyul is mentioned, so the question is ""have you heard the name of that tea before?""
directive is also another yes or no question here. It is possible that oylong is short for oolong, a type of green tea. If the answer is yes, then the directive is to ""please bring a cup of it for me."" If no, however, there is no directive here, since the person asking is just trying out a new tea type. 
 commissives are used when you need to convey a message but do not want to use words. For example: ""Please don't forget to bring the keys to your car."" Here the commissived message is that you should not forget.

"
570,"This text provides information that is a general conclusion about how to dress for a particular purpose. The information is provided to provide context to the topic, and is therefore not a request for an action. 
It seems 'clothe make man'. This is an example of a figurative expression, where the meaning is conveyed by the use of words rather than by their literal meaning.

"
571,"Inform is a more general dialogue action category than question or directive and commissives. Inform indicates a request for information, whereas question and directive are more specific types. The inform dialogue acts include the phrases ""over what"" and ""about what"". The question dialogue actions are ""what"" (which indicates information seeking) and the directive dialogue is ""on what terms"" or ""under what circumstances"" which indicate a command. Commissives include a variety of types, including order, suggestion, warning, prohibition, promise, request, invitation, entreaty, advice, reprimand, menace, threat, exhortation, recommendation, prayer, appeal, petition, complaint, remonstrance, plea, supplication, exclamation, query, inquiry, statement, declaration, avowal, affirmation.

"
572,"In the above text the question mark indicates the beginning of a new question
Out of question question is the correct dialogue tag for this act
Question is a core dialogue structure, so it is likely that this is indeed a 'question'

If you would like to learn more about dialogue acts, I recommend the following resources:

"
573,"Inform is used when the sender is seeking information or explanation from a recipient. 
Question is the most common dialogueact used by a sender when they are seeking clarification from another person, especially when that person is not responding. 
  Directive is another common response from non-verbals when a person does something you do not like. Commissive, on occasion, can also be used in this situation.

"
574,"Inform is a less assertive form of communication than question or command, and is used when the sender is simply seeking to understand the thoughts or feelings of the other person. Inform acts are often used in a social context, such as when two people are talking to one another, or when a group of people is communicating with oneanother. 
  
  In this example, ""it best be"" is an inform act, as it's used to share information.

"
575,"In this example, ""anything isbetter thannothing"" is an example of a non-assertive statement. This type of statement is not a request for information or a recommendation, and does  not express a strong opinion. 
  
  The use  of ""wait andsee"" indicates the author is looking forward for the future to confirm or learn more about something.

"
576,"Directive dialogue acts are used when the conversation is about a person or entity who is not the one who initiated the communication. For example, a customer service representative might use a directive dialogue to communicate with a manager when a problem has occurred. The manager is the entity that initiated contact, but the manager needs to make the request of the customer support agent to take action. 
  
In this example the directive act would be a request for the agent's help. Inform dialogue Acts are typically used to provide information to a recipient.

"
577,"inform is used when the dialogue partner is simply sharing information, without asking for it or seeking agreement;
question is when a request for information is made, but the information provided is incomplete or unclear; 
directly is the most common dialogue acts for giving orders or instructions; commissives are used for promises or commitments.

"
578,"Directive is an inform-requesting act, where the sender is requesting the receiver to do something. In this case, it seems like the person asking to put off the meeting is suggesting that it be put-off to another day. 
  
Out of direct request: the directive act can also be used when the request is not a direct one. For example, if you ask someone to pass you the salt, you are not asking the individual to stop holding the bottle of salt for you. You are asking him to hand you a salt shaker, and you have already asked him for the shakers. So, in this example too, we can use the out of directive option. 
In this particular case too we could argue that this is out-of-directive, because the asker is actually seeking confirmation from his askee. He is looking for a yes/no answer, so he is using the question option, instead of the direct inform option which would be more appropriate.

"
579,"Out of question: there is not a direct question asked in the given text. Rather, it is a general statement about going outside again, without any further context. Therefore, this is an example of out of ask, out directive and out commissives. 
  
Over ask: the prediction of the inform dialogue acts is overridden by a more specific question. In this case, there was a specific request for clarification, asking Mike if it was ok to not go outside.

"
580,"Inform indicates a speaker providing general information to a listener. The information provided in this case is about a person with a headache and how they have managed to deal with the headache. In this context, it is not seeking further information. 
Question indicates an inquiry or request for information from a source. Here, we see the question ""how"" being asked of a bank representative. By asking this question the user is inquiring as to how to proceed with their banking request. 
  
  Question is overlaid over Inform in the example provided. If the Informer is to provide general background information, then the Questioner is expected to be providing further context or explanation.

"
581,"the text indicates the need for information, and the receiver should provide the information requested
it seems the request is an order, i should find the receipt and provide it to the asker

A:
According to your explanation, it seems that your text contains an indication of an ordering. So, based on your answer, I would classify the dialogue as a request for an information and a command.

"
582,"Question is characteristic for a request for information. The speaker appears
to be seeking clarification about a topic that is important to the
conversation. 
  
Out ofinform is the classification for the dialogue acts of providing
information. This classification is used when the information provided is
not relevant to what the interlocutor is asking or when it does
contribute to that conversation. In this case, it appears that this is an
attempt to provide information that does contribute to this conversation,
but is also not relevant. 

question is another characteristic dialogueact of asking questions. Here, 	the speaker seems to want to know something, but does so in a way that implies they are not sure.


Directive is classification of giving commands.  In this context, giving a
command is likely to result in the listener taking the command as a fact. For example, ""slow down"" is often interpreted as ""stop"", which the questioner may not want. However, in this example the response ""ofcourse, I do."" is providing confirmation that ""Slow down means stop"" and so the directive classification applies. 


 commissives are classifications of making commitments. Committing to something implies a certain level of certainty, and the person committing to it may be surprised if the commitment is broken. Therefore, this classification may apply when someone is surprised by the answer. An example of commissing is ""I'm going to stop at the red light.""

"
583,"""basicslly,you just cant drive."" is an informational statement that does not require a response. It is a clear, straightforward, and straightforwardly-expressed conclusion about driving that is not likely a statement of opinion or a request for confirmation.

"
584,"In the above text the inform act describes the sender's thoughts or feelings towards the action the message is about. The inform action is a non-verbal form of communication that can often be used to convey thoughts, feelings, and intentions. 
  

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible dialogue acts for an email: Inform, Question, Directive, Commisive.  The text you provided falls into the Informat, Command, Inquire, Request dialogue category.

"
585,"Directive is a type of dialogue acts that express a request or order. The directive dialogue Acts are usually used when the message is about something that needs to be done immediately, such as a phone call or an email. 
  
  In this example, based on this message, it is clear that a directive act was used because the sender is requesting the recipient to call them when their package arrives.

"
586," commissives are used when the information provided is insufficient to make an appropriate decision. For example, a bank might provide a customer with a loan application form, but the customer is unable to fill it out correctly without additional information or guidance. 
  
directives indicate that something is expected of someone, and they should take action in response to that expectation. In other words, they are asking someone to do something. An example of that is a salesperson asking you to buy their product. If you are given a product, you should try it and decide whether you like it or not. Then you can decide if you want to purchase it.

"
587,"Question is a sub-class of directive and is used to express a direct request for information, a clarification, an explanation, etc. 
  
  In this example, may I help You? is asking for permission to help the person you are speaking to.

"
588,"Inform: the information provided is not sufficient to answer the question and does not require a response. 
Question: there is a request for a recommendation or suggestion. The question is whether a tour is sufficient. 
  Directive: a command or instruction is given.  
 commissIVE: this is an instruction to do something.

"
589,"Question: ""Are you interest in natural landscapes or human landscapes?""
Human Landscape: I am interested both in human and natural lands.

"
590,"""directive"" is a more specific label than ""inform""
the text is asking K.A.R. to speed up their car
there is an instruction given in this statement

A:
According to the model, ""direct"" acts are those that ask questions, tell people what to do, make promises, etc. ""Inform"", on its own, does not fit into this category, as it is not a ""question"", ""command"", or ""promise"".

"
591,"the text contains a commissIVE verb (one day) which suggests that it was not intended to be a statement but rather a command or order. 
based on context, this is likely a mistake by the author.

"
592,"Question: the sender is not providing enough information to understand the request, so the receiver has to fill in some of the blanks. 
Overinform: there is too much information provided by the message, and the question is therefore not clear. 
  

I can help with the following:
1. I'm a senior data analyst with extensive experience in data analysis and data visualization. My team is available to assist you with your project. Please contact me at +1 (555) 555-5555. Alternatively, you can send me an email at [email protected]
2. We can also discuss this over coffee. Let me know what time is good for you.

"
593,"Directives are instructions for another person to do something, typically something that is in the interest of both the speaker and receiver. In this case, it's asking for more details about what the two of you are going to work on together. 
Promises are not present in this conversation, so it does fall under directive.

"
594,"In the first sentence, 'need i' is an interrogative word, so the dialogue acts are question and commissIVE. 
'help' in the second sentence is also an interrogation word. So the dialogues act in this sentence would be question. 
  
However, in both the third and fourth sentences,  'you' are used as the subject of the sentence. This is the typical way of introducing a command. In this case, since the command is to show the location of chinese-style clothing and the addressee is not a person but a machine, it is classified into commissitive.

"
595,"Question: ""How bad Did I Do?""
Out of Inform: This text does not provide any information, it asks for an assessment from its recipient. 
  Question is the most appropriate dialogueact for this type of text.

"
596,"In this example, we can see that there is an intention or desire to alter the specified date (from 24 to28). In addition, there are no explicit requests or instructions given by the sender. Therefore, this is more likely to be a command or an order.

"
597," commissives are used to make requests or requests of another person. The request can be for something to be done, such as a commissión, a request to do something, to go somewhere, an order, etc. They can also be requests for someone to take action, like a comisarón, who is responsible for doing something. 
  
Over-commissives can make too many requests, and are too directive. Commissive acts are more directive and ask for things to happen, while inform acts ask questions and give orders.

"
598,"While the first sentence of the message provides context for the emergency, there is no further information provided in the subsequent text. Therefore, this is likely a query for more information. 
In addition, 911 is an emergency number that is typically used for emergencies. It is possible that this message is being sent in response to a message received by a caller, and the caller is seeking clarification of what the issue is.

"
599,"Inform: the directive act indicates the intention to give information or instructions. 
Question:  the interrogatory structure of "" why"" indicates a request to receive an explication or an reason. 
  Directive: in this context, it is the instruction to do something.  
Commissive : the act conveys a command or a demand.

"
600,"Question is the most likely dialogueact because it is used to seek information or direction from another person. The speaker in this example is trying to find out when the other person was last awake, so that they can wake them up. 
  
Out ofinform is also used when asking a person a general question about something. In this case, it would be used if I asked you when was the last time the sky was blue.

"
601,"Inform is used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision. For example, a person might ask for additional information to better understand a situation. 
  
Question is the most likely dialogue action in this example. Ernest Hemingway is known for his short stories and novels, and ""The man with the Golden Arm"" is one of his most famous works. This text might be asking if the person lastnight was at a book reading or if they have any books by Ernest  Hemingwa.

"
602,"""where"" could be seen as a location question. In this case, ""where thebreak was in"" would be the location, and the question is ""Where was this break?"". 
Alternatively, this could also be considered a non-directive question as the answer is not ""go to the store and buy a new one"" but rather ""this break was where the other one was"".

A:
According to your explanation, I think the dialogue acts of the given text are question and inform: 

 

Surely, ofcourse,i like to drink tea in tea-houses. 
  Sure,I like drink Tea in Teahouse. I mainly Eat Baked Chicken as there is less fat.

"
603,"the text uses the word 'happened' to introduce a new topic
this text does not ask any questions, make any promises, orders, commands, clarifies anything, nor does it give any information about what happened. Therefore, it is classified here because it can also be classified inform

A:
According to your example, you can use the following rule to determine the dialogue acts: 
if the first word is ""sure"" or ""yep"", then it's a yes
yes is a declarative statement
y'all is an exclamation
sure is another declaratives
then it must be a questions
therefore, yes is the answer

"
604,"Question is the most likely dialogueact given the context of the passage. The question is posed to the character Kira, who is not present in this passage, and the question does not appear to have an answer. 
  

A:
According to this article, ""question"" is one of four possible dialogue acts for inform.  The other three are ""request"", ""command"", and ""beseech"".  ""request"" and 'request' are similar to ""order"" in that they are requests for something to happen.   ""command""  is similar in meaning to order, except it is an order to do something that is against the will of that person. ""Beseech"" means to beseeching, asking for a favor.

"
605,"In the given statement, it is not clear whether the information provided is for the benefit of a third party or for someone's benefit. If it was for another person's benefits, then it would be a request. However, if it benefits the person providing the advice, this is an informative statement. 
  
If the statement is meant to benefit a specific person, that person must be the addressee of whom the message is being sent. In this case, since the sender is the other person (the chef), the recipient of that message must also be another individual. Therefore, we can assume that this statement was meant for benefit for one person only, i.e. the chef.

"
606,"Question: ""why does there seem to be a gap in our communication?""

In this case, there does seem like there is some sort of break in communication. However, it's hard to tell exactly what happened without knowing more about the context.

"
607,"Inform is used to describe a request for information. The speaker wants the listener to provide information that is relevant to their request. 
  
Question is often used when someone is trying to find out something, such as ""who won the election?"". It is also used in a more general way to ask questions, for example, ""why is it so hot in here?"" or ""what is that noise?"" 
   
Directive is sometimes used as a transition to tell someone what to do, and commissives are used for commands or orders, like ""stop"" or for expressing feelings,  like ""I'm angry"". 
    
 commissIVE is only used once in this example.

"
608,"In this example, we can see that ""no"" is the answer to the question ""can you do it?"". The answer is ""yes"" if the person is able to do the task on their own, but ""I don’t need help"" would be the correct answer if they need assistance to complete the given task.

"
609," commissives are often used to express a request for information, advice, consent, etc. and are therefore often considered to be questions. 
However, in this case, it is more likely that this is simply a sharing of a realization or piece information about the task at hand, so it should be classified instead as inform.

"
610,"""how much"" is a relative term, meaning ""how compared to what?"". This is an example of relative clause, a type of subordinate clause that provides additional information to the main clause. In this case, ""the chocolatebar"" provides the context for "" howmuch"" to refer to. 
In addition, this is another example where the use "" isn’t it? "" at end of the sentence indicates a "" question"" nature.

"
611,"Inform is the most likely dialogue acts to appear in a text when the
  speaker is giving information to the receiver. Inform acts are characterized
by the absence of questions, commands, promises, or commitments.

"
612,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask questions, whereas non-question dialogue Acts are not. The question dialogue Act in this example is question because it contains words such as 'how', 'why', or 'what'. The other three dialogueActs in the example are classified in a different way: inform is used for information that is provided, rather than asking for it; directive is for commands; and commissIVE is a combination of directive and information, where the information is given in order to make an order or a request.

"
613,"overinform: the prediction is that this is a statement of fact, not a request for information
question: there is not enough information in this statement to make an informed decision
directive: this appears to involve instructions, requests, and offers
commissive : this does not appear to contain a commitment or request

A:
According to this article, there are only four possible dialogue acts: inform; question; directive; and commissIVE.

"
614,"Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to request or order someone to do something. In this case, we can interpret the given request as 'give me 4 then' because of the use the word 'then'. This is because the next line is not a request for more information, as it is the same as asking the person to repeat their order. Therefore we predict that this is directive.

"
615,"In this example, ""there was a reason"" is an indication that ""the speaker was sharing
information"". It's not seeking an answer, asking for an opinion, making an offer,
or making any kind of commitment.

"
616,"This text contains a request for help or assistance from the
listener. This is a strong indicator that it should be classified under
directive. 
  
Directive is the most common dialogue acts in English. Directives are
used to tell someone what to do, when to perform a task, and how to
perform a  task. In this case, a housekeeper is requesting that a guest
be allowed to enter their home.  This is an example of a directional
request.

"
617,"This text is conveying a request or order, and therefore it would be classified under the commissives category. 
It is also providing the information that 'next time' the person will buy weed from the same person, so it could be categorized as an order.

"
618,"the text asks a direct question about whether the service should be performed now (now) or at a later time (later). This indicates the question is being asked in order to receive an immediate answer, making it an interrogative dialogueact. 
mr. sander's phone is not available. he is probably in a meeting and will be unavailable for a few minutes. would it be better to perform the task later or now? 
  

In this case, performing the job now would be the best option.


text:  'i come now, shall it do?'

  The text indicates a preference for now over later, indicating the dialogue is interrogatory.  This is overinform, over question, over directive, and over commissives. 
   
   The speaker indicates their preference by asking the query. The query is now.   

   In response to the request, Mr. Sandals provides the phone numbers of both the receptionist and the manager. Mr Sandels provides his phone as a means of providing the requested information. He does so by providing a directive dialogue action. In this instance, he provides a phone call as the means to get the information he has requested. It is a way to communicate his request and provide the necessary information to complete the action requested by the sender.    

"
619,"Directive dialogue acts are used when the conversation is about asking someone to take an action. The person being asked is usually not aware of the action that is required, and the dialogue is used to give the person enough information to decide whether to comply or not. 
In this case, smoking is an option that needs to be considered by the smoker, but they are not given enough details to know whether they should smoke or avoid it. By asking them to choose between the two, it is clear that they need to pick one or the other, so that it can be decided whether the request is complied with or whether it will be followed up on.

"
620,"Inform is a non-verbal communication style that conveys information without making a request or offering an opinion. 
  
  In this example, ""ofcourse,i do."" is an inform statement.  It conveives information by stating a fact without offering a suggestion or opinion on that fact.

"
621,"Directive is a dialogue acts that is used when someone is giving orders or making a request. In this case, it is the speaker (sender) asking the listener (recipient) for some item or service. 
  
  The text: ""please get us somesoap for our room"" is directive because it indicates a person giving an order or request to another person. The order is for something specific, like ""get us a towel for drying our hands after washing them in the bathroom sink."" 
   
In contrast, inform is another dialogue Acts that indicates someone providing information to someone who is interested in it.  In this example, ""we are having a special on soap. You can get 20% off your next order by using the code 'HOTEL' at checkout."" The speaker is not giving a directive order, but is instead providing useful information.

"
622," commissives are often used to express a request for another person to take action, such as cleaning up after themselves or doing their laundry. In this case, it is requesting the other person (in this instance, you) to stop smoking. 
  
questionals are used when a person wants to know something, but does want to share that information with others. For example, a friend may ask ""are we there yet?"" when they are looking at a map, and the listener does NOT want others to see their destination. A question would be ""yes"", while a statement would simply be the word ""we"". 
      
commands are when someone is giving instructions to another. The instructions may be to do something with their hands, feet, mouth, etc. Commands are not always negative, as in ""stop that from happening!"". They can be positive, like ""go get that for me!"" or ""run that by me again, would you?"".

"
623,"In this example, richards asks a 'question' but it is really a request for advice. He is looking for a way to fix his plumbing problem without calling a plumber. 
This is because richars asks, 'can you fix it?'. This is an interrogative sentence, where the question mark indicates a doubt or uncertainty. In this case, he is unsure if a local plunger is available to help him. 
  

However, if we look at the surrounding text we see that he has already asked for some advice, by stating that his nose and throat are'sore'. He has also mentioned that 'it is raining', which could be a factor in his current plumbing situation. So, in this context, it seems like he wants to know if it would be better to call a professional plumper or to try and fix the problem himself.

"
624,"Question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the presence of a doubt or uncertainty. In this case, there is a lack of information in the provided sentence, and the asker is therefore seeking clarification or an explanation. 
  
Out of question: this is the negative reply of ‘yes, I’m right.’ The reply is out of context, since it is in response the the statement ‘you will not keep the item for three days.’ 
 Out of directive: in this context the word ‘of course’ is used as a directive word, indicating that something is obvious or should be obvious.

"
625,"the text indicates the time it will take to go to a hospital, but does so without providing an estimate;
it is likely that the parent is asking for an estimation of the severity of their daughter’s injury, indicating that she is requesting information.

"
626,"In this example,'may i' is an imperative verb, and it is used as an order to someone who is not a direct participant in the conversation. The use of 'May I' as the subject of an 'Of Course' type response indicates that mrs. X is giving permission for someone to enter her presence.

"
627,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask a direct question. They are
  typically used in a conversation when the other person has not given
   clear instructions, when they are not sure of the answer, and when
they want to know the opinion of others. 
  

In this case, based on this dialogue, I would classify the question dialogue  act as a request for clarification.

"
628,"Over-prediction: the model predicted question as the next dialogue action, when in fact it was inform. 
Under- prediction: it is important to note that question is also a valid response in this context, and the dialogue model should have predicted that. 
  However, it's important not to over-interpret the under-performance of a dialogue system, as it could just be a matter of the system not having enough data to make a confident prediction.

"
629,"'why do I think I am qualified' is a questioning statement. 
It is asking another question to the candidate, 'why me?'. 
  This is because 'I' in the first sentence is the subject of the statement, and the second sentence uses the verb 'think' to talk about'my qualifications'. 
   This means that 'how' and 'who' are implied in 'Why do  I think  that I  are qualified?'

Without revealing dialogueact label, you can say that this is an example of a 'questioning statement'.

"
630,"Overinform: the statement gives too much information, providing too many details about my experience and background. 
Question: is this statement a yes or no? If the answer is yes, then the rest of my message will not be necessary. If it is a no, I will need to know more about your position to determine if I am a good fit. 
  Directive: I need you to do something. I want you do this. Commendation.  
Commissive : I commit to doing this job.

"
631,"Directive dialogue acts are used to request a specific action or behavior from the other person. In this case, ""tell me"" is a request for the listener to share something personal about themselves. 
  
Out of directive: the directive dialogue is used when the information provided is not sufficient to complete the request. For example, if the asker of a query is looking for a recommendation, but the questioner does  not know anyone who can provide one, then the query would be classified under directive.

"
632,"'i am afraid' and 'there'sbeen amistake' are both negative statements, so the dialogue acts for these statements are commissives. 
'thank youvery much', on its own, is a positive statement, therefore it should be classified under the inform act

A:
According to the GPT-2 model, ""thank-you very-much"" is the correct response.

"
633,"Question: This text poses a direct question to the reader. The question is about how the author feels about computer development. 
  
Overinform: the question does provide some information, however, it provides too much information. This is a common problem with questions. They provide too many details, and this makes the answer difficult to find. In this case, providing too little information would have been better. 
Questions are often too general, so it's hard to provide a good answer. For example, ""how are you?"" is too generic, while ""I'm fine, how are things with you?,"" is not specific enough. A better question would be ""what do think of computer developments?"".  This provides more detail and allows the person answering to focus on specific aspects of development that are important to them.

"
634,"Inform is a dialogueact that is used to express surprise or ask a clarifying question. The speaker in this example is surprised that a problem they were experiencing on their computer was actually a software problem and is now asking for clarification.

"
635,"Question: I have never designed a program concerning networks. 
Information: You have not designed or developed any program that deals with networks? 



A:

I think the answer is that the question is not really a prediction, but rather a request for information, and the information provided is sufficient to answer the request.

"
636,"In this example, 'yes' is a confirmation of something the sender has just said. Therefore, it is classified under the category of question. 
  
'sure' can also be considered as a clarification of the preceding statement. In this case, therefore, this phrase is also classified in the same category as question: inform(over question). 
   
However, if we consider the context of 'of course', it can mean 'without any doubt'. In that case the dialogue acts category for this sentence would be commissIVE.

"
637,"In this example, ""have"" is used as a preposition, indicating that ""anything"" can be added after it. Therefore, it can also be considered a yes/no question or a statement of fact. 
""Have"" indicates a direct question to the subject of interest, and it also implies that there is something the person asking the question is missing. 
  In the example provided, there are no missing pieces or information that would be relevant to this question; therefore, this is considered to fall under question category and not the other dialogue acts.

"
638,"""can youtell me"" is a request for information. The recipient of that request should answer ""yes"" or ""okay"" to indicate that they are able to understand the request. 
If the response is ""no"", the sender should consider whether they could have been more specific in their request, and if not, consider rephrasing the question. 
  

Yes, you are responsible for the position in which you find yourself.

"
639,"Inform is a dialogueact that is used when the information provided is for informational purposes only. Inform does not express an opinion, make a recommendation, offer a solution, request a decision, assume a position, include facts that have been verified, imply a warranty, promise a result, express a guarantee, state a fact that has already been proven, suggest a course of action, recommend a book, article, website, etc. 
  
Question is the most common dialogue acts used in conversations. When asking a direct question the person asking the question is looking for a clear answer to a specific question and expects an immediate answer. A question can be followed by a response if the other person is interested in the response. If the asker does want to know more about something then they will often ask a follow up question or will continue the conversation by starting a discussion. 
Directive is another common dialogical act used to express someone is giving orders or asking someone to do something. Directives are not followed if someone does choose to ignore them. Commissive are used if you want someone else to take action. For example, if I ask you to pass the salt you will typically respond with a directive such as ""pass thesalt"" or ""please pass me the Salt"". If I want you pass it to me yourself you might respond by commissing by saying ""I will pass you theSalt"" 
   
Over use of question/directive/commissives can lead to the loss of trust between the parties.

"
640,"Inform is a dialogueact that is used to provide information to another person. This text uses the phrase, ""this is"", which is aninformative statement that explains that the information provided is based on personal knowledge. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive: This is the only inform act in the sample text.

"
641,"Question is the correct dialogueact for 'is there anything else i can help with?'. Question is a request for clarification or assistance. This is because the question mark at the end of the sentence suggests a possibility of a follow-up question. 
'isthereanythingelseicanhelpwith?'

However, inform is also a valid dialogueAct for another part of that text. 
  'actually fruits  and vegetables are good  for you'
  The text shares  information or  knowledge about  the benefits  of fruits   and  vegetables.  This is an informative statement and not a direct question or request.

"
642,"In this example, ""yes"" is an informative statement, since it provides the reader with information that is not asked for, given, promised, commanded, etc. The reader is informed that the item in question is available in only a single copy.

"
643,"Directive dialogue acts are typically used to give instructions, make offers, or ask for a response. The sender in this example is giving a suggestion for future outings, and the response indicates acceptance. 
  
Commissive dialogues are used when the relationship between the parties is not so clear. In this case, it is unclear whether the message is from a friend or a business. If the latter, then the act would be commissarial (question, inform). 
"
644,"Inform (or answer) is a dialogueact that conveys information. The sentence ""you failed"" is likely conveying the information that you did not do well on a particular test. 
  
Question (question, direct, commit, request) would be a better choice if the answer is ""yes"" or ""of course"" but is also possible that ""it's possible"" would also be an appropriate response.

"
645,"Question: Yes, I am. Jenny is crying. 
Information: Jenny has just learned that her father has passed away. 
  She is very sad and is probably crying at this moment.  
Direction: Please tell her that I'm here if she needs anything.

"
646,"In this case, 'take he/she away' is a direct request, and the rest of text does indicate that it is an instruction or order. 
'take him/her away,' on its own, can also be an acknowledgment of something provided. However, in this context, it seems to be a clarification of 'away' as in 'I want you to take him away.'

"
647,"In this example, ""just coming"" is an adverb that modifies the verb ""coming"" in the following sentence. Therefore, it modifes the meaning of the sentence and is therefore classified here as overinform.

"
648,"the text does ask an open-ended question (""why are you bother me?"")
it is a request for information (""i tried my hardest to avoid you"")
there is an implied command (""keep bother"")

"
649,"Question: ""Why can't I be Good to Her?""

This question is posed to the sister, who has asked her brother to cook duck for her. It is not clear from this passage whether the brother is the questioner or the questioned. Based on this, we predict that this is actually a statement, and not a query. 
  
Statement: I don't know why I can’t beGood toHer. I try my best to do so, but I fail. What can I do to make it better? 
   
In this statement the word ""can't"" is used to indicate a lack of ability or capability.  This is an example of the copula verb ""to be"" being used as a modal verb. Modals are verbs that can be used in sentences to express possibility, possibility or permission, without requiring an action to take place. For example, ""Can you pass the salt?"" can mean ""Would you mind passing the Salt?"" or ""Could you please pass  the Salt?"", but it does not require the subject to pass any salt. In this case, it's likely that ""I can"" was used instead of  ""I could"" to emphasize the difficulty of achieving the goal.

"
650,"Inform is a directive dialogueact, used when someone is giving information to another person or organization. Inform indicates an intent to communicate, and is used to request or tell someone something. 
Question is another directive act, indicating a desire for clarification or an attempt to obtain information. 
  Question can also be used as a request for assistance or assistance in decision-making.  
Directive is an act used for making requests or giving orders. It is also used in negotiations and to make a statement of intent. Directive can be either affirmative or negative. An affirmative directive is one that orders someone to do something, while a negative directive tells someone not to act in a certain way. Commissive, on occasion, is mistakenly used instead of directive. Commissive indicates a wish to commit or a suggestion that something be done. However, it is not used with a person to indicate an order to that person.

"
651,"Question: the question mark indicates a questioning or interrogative nature to the statement. The statement does not provide information, but rather conveys a request for information. 
  
Informative: this statement provides the reader with basic information that is not otherwise provided in the context of the conversation. For example, it could be a general statement about where one can buy a particular item. 
Promise: if the information provided is relied upon, then a promissory nature is implied. In this case, a guarantee is made that if a reader follows the link provided, they will be able to purchase the item at the stated price.

"
652,"In the example provided, ""they are only 20 per a hundred dozen"" is information. However, this is not a directive request, as the information is provided as a fact, not as an order. 
""open your mouths and SAY AH"" could be considered a command, however, in this case, there is no indication that this was a direct order, rather it was more of an encouragement to do something, so this act would be classified under the commissives category. 
                  
Finally, maybe you could look for a nearby outlet? is a suggestion, therefore this dialogue acts would fall under that category

"
653," commissives are often asking questions or giving orders, and they tend to be more negative in tone. 
In this case, however, it seems like the person asking is expressing sympathy and concern for the other person's health. Therefore, this is classified instead as an informational dialogueact.

"
654,"Directives are statements that seem to offer assistance, prompt action, make requests, etc. In this case, ""sunset hotel may Ihelp you?” is an example of an directive that is offering help. 
  
Questions are used to seek information, clarification, recommendations, and confirmation. This text does ask for recommendations or information about condiments, so it's a good candidate for being classified aquestion. However, it does seem like the question is being asked by the person asking the recommendation, not the other way around.

"
655,"inform is used to provide information that is already known to the other person. In this case, it appears that ""i will just check the car for  you, Sir"" is information known by the person being addressed. 
  
question is another type of dialogue that can be used when someone is asking for information. This text could be interpreted as a person asking another person a simple question such as ""are you ok?"". The answer to this question would be ""yes"" or ""no"". 
   
directly asks someone to do something. For example, ""go and get me a coffee"" would fall into this category
  comissively makes a commitment to someone. ""I will never cheat on you"" falls into the commissitive category

"
656," commissives are used to request or order someone to do something. In this case, someone is being asked to leave, so the response should be a request to depart. 
  
Out of commissively used:

question: the dialogue acts of questions are classified into two categories: question and interrogative. Interrogative is used when someone asks a direct question. Question is when a person asks an open-ended question that doesnot have an answer. 
directive: a commissIVE used for telling someone what to DO. For example, a police officer might tell a suspect to put their hands behind their back. This is a Commissive because telling the suspect what they are supposed to accomplish is the goal of a dialogue.  Inform is not used here because there is no telling what the police suspect was doing with their hand behind the back, but it could be something bad. Commissives can also be used in the form of commands, such as ""put your hands on top of your head"" or ""stop"". Commands are orders to another person to carry out a task.

"
657,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask someone a direct question. In this example, ""how much these are apples?"" is a straightforward question that is asking for an answer. 
Overinform dialogue Acts are similar to question dialogueacts, but they are asking too much information. ""How much this are apple?"" does a poor job of providing enough information for the asker to understand. 
  

A:
According to this article, there are four types of dialogue: ireport, report, request, and order.  Based off of your example text and the predictions, it appears that the dialogue is report.

"
658,"In the question sentence, there is a request for a quantity. However, since the quantity is not specified, this question can also be categorized as directive. 
Additionally, in this sentence the word ""you"" is used, a usage which indicates that the answer is being provided by the addressee. This is another reason why this can classified this as query.

"
659,"the text asks a direct question about almost $1, but the context suggests that it is a request for information, so the act should be classified in this category. 
it is not clear from this context whether the pineapple is for sale or not. if it's not forsale, then the question is really about money, and the answer should also be aboutmoney. but if the item isfor sale, it should not be a matter of money.

"
660,"In this example, based on information in the previous sentence, it appears that Mike is explaining the reasons for buying flowers. The flowers are not for eating, so it is not a commissivo act. Additionally, they are for Worship, and Mike does this for his wife, KARA, therefore it can be inferred that this act would be for KARAs benefit.

"
661,"This text contains information that indicates the difficulty the author has talking in general and the efforts they have made to overcome this difficulty. This is a typical question in English. 
  
However, there is also a strong indication that this is an order or a command in the form of a payment. If the reader does not believe the payment is crazy, they may interpret the question as a business requirement. In this case, it is considered a commissitive act, because the order is to do something for a reward.

"
662,"the text suggests that someone should make changes to their diet, and
it is likely that this person is asking the person who is speaking to guide them through this process.

"
663,"""bananas"" is a plural noun, so the first example is an example of ""information overload"". The second example provides more information than is necessary to make the point being made, and is therefore classified under the inform dialogue action.

"
664,"Question is one of the most common and most useful dialogue acts. When used correctly, a
question can help a conversation flow more naturally and efficiently. In particular, when a sender
is seeking information (or clarification) from a recipient (a questioner), the natural flow of
conversation is from question to answer. However, if a message is primarily providing
information (without a request for clarification or assistance), then the message may be classified
as overinformative. 
  
Inform is another common dialogueact used in communication. Unlike question which
requests a reply, inform is generally understood as providing factual or
statistical information. For example, ""there are 3 types or flavors of coffee: black,
coffee, and decaf"". 
   
Directive is yet another useful and common dialogicalteact. Like question and inform
it can also be used to request a decision or response from another person, but unlike
questions and informs it does not imply a need for a follow up action. An example of directive
would be ""you need to do X, Y or Z"".

A:
Some other useful definitions: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_act
""Question: Ask a yes/no question or make a statement that invites a comment or answer.""

So, yes, they are useful for understanding the meaning of text.

"
665,"Taiwan is not a country. Taiwan is a name used for convenience to refer to the island of Taiwan, China, and its capital, Taipei. 
Mr. Sandals is an American brand. 
  

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible answers: yes, no, maybe, I don't know.  The answer ""I don’t know"" is the most common.

"
666,"Inform is a conditional act that is used when the information being provided is important to understand but not critical to make an immediate decision. 
  
  The speaker in this example is providing important information to a person who is unfamiliar with the situation. However, this information is only necessary to help the person make the right decision, and the decision is ultimately up to that person. Therefore, inform is the appropriate dialogueact for this situation because the content of what the individual is being told is ""overly important"" but the importance of that information does ""not require a decision to be made immediately."" 
   
Question is appropriate when a listener is trying hard to figure something out, but there is insufficient information provided by the conversation partner to do so. In this case, there are several actions that could be taken by either the sender or the receiver of information. The lack of clarity in what is expected of either party makes it difficult for the questioner to know what to expect.   

  In this instance, it appears that there may be several steps involved in completing the action that was requested. Without additional information from the conversational partner, determining what action to take may not be possible. As such, a query is likely appropriate.


Directive is an appropriate act when one person is attempting to give instructions to another.  This act can occur in a variety of situations, including when two people are communicating with each other, when an individual asks another for advice,  or when someone is making an offer to an other. Directives are often used to communicate a clear and specific instruction, such as ""turn left at the next traffic light,"" or ""stop smoking.""

   In the example provided, one individual (the recipient) is requesting a copy of photos from another individual. While it may seem like the request is for something simple, without additional context it's not clear exactly what was asked for. Based on this, an directive is most likely the correct dialogue action for these circumstances. When giving directions, people often want to emphasize a particular aspect of an action, so the directive may include additional instructions, like ""here are the files you requested,"" ""don't worry, I'll take care of it,"" and ""it's in here.""  

 The example text does include a request, however, since the photo files are being transferred to two different recipients, additional direction may also be appropriate to ensure that both recipients receive the requested files. For example, ""Please send a dozen copies to each of these recipients,""  ""Please keep one copy for yourself,""""  and ""Here's the link to your files.""

Commissive, on occasion, is also appropriate as a dialogueAct in some circumstances, particularly when there's a sense of obligation or responsibility on one side of communication. People may use this act to express a feeling of responsibility to fulfill a commitment or obligation, even if the obligation is to complete a task that may cause harm or discomfort to others. An example of when this type of act may apply is when you're talking to somebody who has just been released from prison, to ask them to return a phone they've lost, for example. Another example might be when somebody is talking about a project that will cause significant harm to other people, in which case they may express their willingness to carry out the project, if necessary, by using a commissitive act

"
667,"Directive dialogue acts are characterized by an attempt to achieve a goal, make an order, or otherwise guide or influence the direction of conversation. 
  
In this case, it appears that ""take four kiwis"" is an instruction or order that is being given to the addressee.

"
668,"Directive is the most general type of dialogue acts. It indicates someone is giving orders or asking someone to do something. 
  
  In this case, amelia is requesting that Mike spare some time for a meeting. This is an example of directive dialogue.

"
669,"Question is a special case of directive where the direction is to ask a follow-up question. In this case, it is likely that there is an ambiguity in the original statement, and the question is intended to clarify the statement for both the asker and listener, by clarifying the meaning of a word or phrase. For example, if the initial statement was ""i want to go to the movies"", the follow up question might be ""why?"".

"
670,"In this example, ""i wanted you to know"" is the information the author is conveying. This is because it does so directly to another person, and not to a non-human entity such as a piece of paper. Therefore, it can be considered an informational statement. 
  
  The author's use of the word "" wanted"" indicates that the statement is being made in the future, so that it may be taken into consideration. Additionally, this statement does seek an answer or evaluation, as the question mark at the end of "" how bad do I do"" suggests that this is something the person being questioned would like to find out.

"
671,"Question dialogue acts are used to seek information, and they typically occur in a conversation between two people. The question dialogueact is used in this example to find out what the other person wants. 
Directive dialogue Acts are instructions that are given to someone else to carry out. In this case, it is the person who wants to look the bill that is being instructed to do so. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think the answer is because of the following reasons: 

 
""The text suggests""
This is why the prediction is ""question""

"
672,"This text shares specific details about one aspect of the company's business, but does so without providing any additional information or asking any questions. This indicates that the information is being shared for the purpose of sharing the details, and not for some other reason. 
For example, this is not a request for information, nor is it a statement of fact. Rather, it indicates the author's intention to share the detail.

"
673,"This text provides clear information to the listener about a personal preference. The listener is not seeking clarification, so the dialogue acts are not classified. 
However, this is a very senior manager, and it is possible that they will not keep you as their manager. They may decide to promote someone else to take your position.

"
674,"In the beginning of your text you mention that you are a taxi driver and that taxi driving is your profession. You then go on to say that there is another offer that is better. Based on this, we can assume that this is not the first time that your taxi business is on standby. Therefore, you cannot be considered as a new taxi owner. 
  

A:
According to the BERT model, ""now, if I were to ask the person, would you prefer a king or a queensize bed?"" is the question form of ""is a kingsize or queenesize""
""yes, a kingsize is fine"" is an answer form.

"
675,"Question: anything wrong w/ it? 
Inform: we can't. If wewent thatfast,we wouldbreak thespeed limit

A:
According to this article, there are four types of questions: question of fact, query, inquiry, and question: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark

"
676,"overinform: the head Office is located in New York, NY, however the company dealing overseas will be based in other cities around the globe. 
question: who is going overseas?
directive: please be careful and be mindful of your actions. 
 commissives: i will need to inform my manager.

"
677,"inform: This is an appropriate dialogue action for this type of text. The speaker provides information to the hearer, and does not ask a direct question or give instructions. 
question: Although the question is implied in the preceding text (i.e. 'will it be...?'), the answer is provided in this sentence. Therefore, this is a valid question
directive: the action of informing is classified under directive. Directives are instructions that are given to someone or something to do something. In this case, informing. 
 commissives: this does fall under commissIVE, as it is the job of commissaries to make promises. However, in a business context, it would be classified out of Commissives.

"
678,"In this example, ""i feel"" is conveying a feeling or emotion. The speaker may be expressing surprise or concern for the listener's reaction to their statement. In this case, it is best to phrase your reply in the form of a declarative statement to express your reaction. 
I am happy to hear that you feel fortunate. I am glad to know that your experience working with foreign companies has gone well so far. 
  

A:
According to the Stanford Corenlp model, this is the answer:  I feel happy that it seems you are enjoying working abroad.

"
679,"This text indicates the need for a recommendation letter, and the person who will write the letter is unavailable at this time, therefore the recommendation cannot be written. 
  
In addition, this is a request for something that requires a formal action, such as a written recommendation, thus it is classified under directive.

"
680,"Directive dialogue Acts are used when the sender is trying to get the receiver to take some kind of action, such as making an appointment, calling a person, buying a product, etc. In this case, you can see that the author is recommending that you contact the person they know at the company. 
  
Out of directive: Inform, Question, Directive, Commissive
Over directive and commissIVE: Question

In this example, there is no action being requested of your, so the message is classified under the out of directives.

"
681,"the text does ask for confirmation, by stating that 4 rooms are ""broken"", and asking ""can you please send somebody here to fix them?"". 
based on this request, it seems like the person asking is not sure if the rooms can actually be fixed, and is looking for another opinion. in this case, a query would be more appropriate, since the request is for information, rather than a command.

"
682,"Question: the given dialogue acts are overinform, overquestion, order, command and commissIVE. 
  Overinform: question
  Overturn: inform
Overquestion: command
Overshadow: directive
Outweigh: commissitive

A:
According to your explanation, you are right. The question is the correct classification.

"
683,"In this example,'small' is an adjective that describes the shirt, so the question is asking the person if they have a shirt that fits the description of small. 
If the dialogue acts were classified using the 'who, what, where, when, why' structure, then the classification for this dialogue would be:

Who: the asker,
What: a description, 

 

Where: in the store,

 

When: when they were looking, 
 
 


 Why: to find the right shirt

 

"
684,"In the example provided, there is no request for further information or instructions. Instead, a simple statement of fact is provided. Therefore, this is an example of a inform statement. 
  
  In contrast, if a request is made for information, further explanation, instructions, commitments, etc., then this statement would be classified under the question dialogue acts. For example, ""Would you like some tea?"" is a typical question that would have a different dialogue structure than the above statement, since a directive dialogue is expected in this case.

"
685,"Directive is a special kind of dialogue acts that indicate that a
speaker is giving a permission or order to another person or
organisation. In this case, it's the examiner who is being asked to
try the car. 
  
Out of directive and question: the examiners response is to inform the applicant that they can try the vehicle. However, this is not a directive response.

"
686,"based on this dialogue, a commissIVE act was predicted. 
the text asks for information and then conveys the information that you 'failed' the test.

"
687,"Question dialogue acts ask questions that require a response. The question in this example, ""it is ten past six, are we late?"" requires a corresponding response to fully understand the question. 
  
In this case, 'yes' is the correct response because the time is given in the present tense, so the response must also be in present form. 'No, we are not late' would be the incorrect response in that case.

"
688,"Mr. Emory is the one who made a mistake. He was the person who was wrong, not me. 
  Mr EmORY: i had you right a minuite ago. Um... just... a MINUTE ago... i was... right... here... 
   Mr EMORY (pointing to his head): Mr. EMory, you're right. I was just looking at your notes. You were right, Mr Emories. Mr EMORYS: Mr EMRORY, i'm right! I'm always right!!

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue: A Theory of Construction"", the following are the most common types of dialogue acts: 
1. Commendation: ""You did a great job.  I'm very proud of you.""
2. Question:  ""How did you do that?"" ""I don't know. What was that you did?""
3. Inform:   ""I had this idea, and I did this, then this."" 

 

4. Directive:    ""You do it this way, but I think you can do this better."" 
                   ""Here, let me show you how to do...""
                   
5. Commissive  :     ""Don't do X, Y, Z, do ABC instead.""

"
689,"In this example, Christine is suggesting that Mary keep her work organized. This is an example of a directive dialogueact, as it is Christine who is taking the initiative to guide the communication. 
  
Without revealing any labels in my response:

I agree with Christine that it would be helpful for Mary to organize her workspace. Organizing one’s workspace is something that one should be able to do on their own, without outside guidance. However, I do not think that this is the best way for for someone to be taught organizational skills. Instead, it might be more effective to provide Mary with examples of how to properly organize their workspace, so that she can practice this on her own.

"
690,"the text does ask for details, by stating that the flowers will be delivered to ""her"" (presumably, Mrs. Emory)
it does give new, specific details about when the speakers plans for visiting the location are, and what the purpose of the visit is

based on these characteristics, this is most likely a request for a response from the recipient of these roses, rather than an instruction to deliver the bouquet to Mrs Emry.

"
691,"Directive is the most general type of dialogue acts. It is used to express instructions, orders, or requests. 
  
  In this example, ""are"" is functioning as the directive word. The ""you"" in the second sentence is understood as an indirect object, and the ""now"" indicates a time at which the request is being made. Together, these factors indicate that ""I wonder if I could borrow of your bicycle"" can reasonably be interpreted as ""Please lend me your bike.""

Question is another type dialogue Acts. Unlike directive acts, questions seek information from the listener. In this sentence, “are” is acting as both a directive and a interrogatory word, functioning both as “please” and as part of a “why” question: “Why are you not lending me the bicycle?”

"
692,"""but you may use this today"" is a request for permission, and the person giving the permission is asking for a favour. This is usually expressed in the third person, as ""you may (use it yourself) today"".

In this case, ""but"" indicates a counter-request, since ""use"" can only be used today. So the other person should not use ""it"" as it is not their own. Instead, they should use their personal pronoun ""I"". This can also be expressed as:
- ""But you, you might want to use that yourself today.""
or
  -  ""But I, I would like to borrow that for today, if you don’t mind.""

"
693,"the text does provide information (i.e. 'it's basicall yit')
it does ask questions (e g, 'why did u speed u up')

"
694,"Inform is the best choice for a dialogue acts for information-giving statements. Inform acts are generally used to provide information to another person, and do not include the intent to influence or prompt a response. 
  
  In this example, inform is a better choice than question because the information is not seeking clarification or advice, but is instead providing a fact.

"
695,"Directive is the most general type of dialogue acts. Directives are used to express wishes, orders, instructions, requests, etc. The directive dialogue Act is used when the message is not asking for a specific response but rather is expressing a general instruction or request. 
  
In this case, based on this short text the directive act applies. First, it is clear that the main purpose of the conversation is to go to dinner. Second, there is no question or command in the original message, so the question mark dialogue rule doesnot apply. Finally, since the information provided is about personal preferences, not required for the completion of a task, then the inform dialogue is more appropriate.

"
696,"""can't"" is a modal verb, and therefore the question mark is required. 
the question is asking about whether the person can drive, based on a previous sentence that said she could ""basilly"" drive. 
  

A:
According to the Stanford Corenlp model, ""oh so"" can be used to ask questions.

"
697,"Question dialogue acts are used when a sender wants information/confirmation from a recipient, but does not want to provide it directly. For example, ""Do you know where the nearest grocery store is?"" is considered a ""question"" because the asker is looking for an affirmative answer, whereas ""yes, I know the address of that grocery market. Are you going there?"" would be considered an ""inform"" dialogue action. 
  
In this example ""are you"" is the question and the answer is ""no, i don't want you to go there"".

A:
According to the definition of Dialogue Act in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_act,
""The term question act (or question-action) is sometimes used as an umbrella term for all the four types of acts, although the precise definition varies by source. In general, a dialogue question is one in which the speaker wants to know something from someone, while the listener is expected to answer. A dialogue directive is when the person giving the order wants someone to do something, without the need for a response. An example of commissives is telling someone what to write. Finally, there is an example in the Merriam-Webster dictionary of dialogue actions that are not question acts or directive acts: commissively. This is defined as ""to agree to or accept something without question or reservation"". In this case, it means that someone is expressing their willingness to accept a gift.

"
698,"""a bit"" is an example of how the word ""little"" could be used in an informal manner, similar to how ""a small"" or ""just a bit small"", or even ""slightly"", are used to describe a situation or amount. Inform is a dialogueact that can also be applied to this situation, because the information provided is in confirmation of something that was previously stated. 
  

I wish I could...
Sure!
No problem.

699,"This text indicates the intent to communicate a request or order. The use of the word ""really"" in the second sentence indicates a desire for confirmation. Therefore, this is a commissIVE dialogue. 
  
However, it is also informative. By sharing information, such as the remaining amount of food, you are providing the receiver with context that may help them better understand the request. In this way, your communication is both informative and commissively motivated.

"
700,"In this example, ""look"" is used to direct the viewer's attention to a specific person. This is an example of the use of directive in the context of communication.

"
701,"He's not hot. He's old. 
Old people are not attractive.

"
702,"Question: What is the name of the speaker? 
Answer: Dunlin

In this case, Dun lin is not providing any information, but instead asking a direct question. The question is answered by the recipient, who says ""my"" name.

"
703,"Inform (question, direct, command, request) is the most common dialogue acts in English. The other four dialogue Acts (inform, ask, tell, warn) are less common. 
Explain why the predict dialogue action for this example is ""inform""

"
704,"In this example, I think the inform dialogue acts are more likely correct than the other options. First, it's clear that the person asking for a bill is directing a person or machine to do something, namely, to give them a copy of their payment. Second, this is an informational request, since the bill itself is the information being requested. Finally, there is no indication that this person is making any kind of commitment or taking any action, and so the predict dialogue action should be inform.

"
705,"Inform (question, command): The dialogue acts of question and command are the most common. In question: “why”, the questioner is asking why something happened. Command: ""do this"", the command is given to the addressee to carry out an action.

"
706,"In this case, it appears that this is an example of directive communication, where the message is clear and indicates a desire for the receiver to take action. The sender asks the person checking the paper for their opinion, and then states that they are going to leave if the check is in the affirmative. This is likely because the asker of questions is typically trying make the request for an answer, whereas the directive is to act on a given request.

"
707,"Question: ""how was it?"" is an open-ended question. The response can include any information or details about how the conversation took place. In this case, ""it"" could refer to either the evening or the interaction between the two people. 
  
Overinform: This is the opposite of question and indicates that the information provided does a good job of summarizing the event. For example, if the response is ""It was great!"" then the dialogue acts are question or commissives. If the answer is omitted, then it's overinform. 
Questions: How was the weather? Was the food good? Did you enjoy the show? These are examples of questions that can be answered with a ""yes"" or ""no"", ""great""/""good"" and ""yeah""/ ""of course"" respectively. These answers are not necessarily exhaustive, so the question dialogue action is question if there is more information that could be provided.  If the answers to these questions are provided, they are commissived.

"
708,"Inform: This dialogue acts are used when someone is providing general information to another person. 
Question: A question is used to seek information. It is usually followed by a statement of enquiry. 
  For example: ""How are the children?"" or ""What time is the concert?""
Directive: When someone gives orders or instructions to someone else. For example, ""Do as I say"" or  ""Give me the money"". 

 

 commissives: These are a type of dialogueact used for making commitments. Commands are often followed with a time limit.  
For Example:  If I give you $20, you must buy me a gift. or If I tell you to go to the store,  you must go immediately.

"
709,"Inform: This is a request for information, so the response should be ""yes, of course"".
Question: this is an inquiry, and the answer should also be yes. 
  
Directive: the dialogue acts for this type of response are question and inform. The response here should not be given, as the question is about what the other person wants to do, not what they should do. 
Commissive (optional): the reply to this should probably be no, that's great.

"
710,"Directives are instructions that require a reaction from another person. In this case, accepting or declining the help offered by the other person requires an action from them. 
  
Questions are seeking information from a listener. The speaker in this example is seeking clarification from their listener as to whether they should accept the offered assistance.

"
711,"This text could be seen as an example of over-informing, as the
speaker is providing too much information to the receiver. The
sender is also asking the question ""how are things going?"" which
indicates that they are seeking further information. In addition,
the phrase 'that'll' could also be interpreted as 'how much will it
cost?' which is another indication of an inquiry.

"
712,"In the passage, it appears that ""do"" is being used as a form of emphasis, suggesting that credit card use is not recommended. However, ""take"" could also be used in place of the word ""credit cards"", and that would make the question non-question. 
  
Also, there is nothing in this passage that indicates the person asking is giving any sort of instruction or making any commitments.

"
713,"Inform is a general category that can be used for any type of information-giving behavior. Inform can also be a response to a request for specific information, such as ""yes"" or ""okay"". In this case, it can likely be inferred that ""we accept"" visa or master card is the specific type or type(s) of payment that was requested.

"
714,"This text indicates the need for the listener to do something in response to the action of the character. The character has just thanked the other for their kindness, and the response from you is to drive through another redlight.

"
715,"This text indicates a desire for the customer to pay for something. The customer is likely a customer or a passerby, so the commissivity is over the information and question of how much the item costs. 
  
However, this is also a clear example of the inform dialogueact, since the price is being shared or provided.

"
716,"This text is a confirmation of something the previous speaker said. 
It is an answer to the question of what the energy source is currently used. And it does ask questions, make commitments, and provide new or additional information - all of which is classified in question.

"
717," commissives are often used in negative contexts to convey a sense of urgency or necessity, and in positive contexts as a sign of respect or gratitude. 
Inform is used to describe a situation where someone is giving information to another person. A question is raised when someone wants more information from someone else. Directives describe an action that someone has taken to follow through on a plan. Commissives express a feeling of commitment to a cause or a person, often in the form of an oath or pledge.

"
718,"In this example, we can see that there is a lack of any question or request being posed to another party. The only instruction or direction being provided is for the listener to take an action. As such, this is an example of a dialogue acting informatively.

"
719,"This text indicates the need for the asker to move ahead with their plans. The ask is ""come again"" and implies that they should continue the conversation. 
It also indicates a need to clarify something that was not clear in the original conversation, so the person who received the message should ask follow up questions.

"
720,"Question is a special type of dialogue acts that indicates a request for information or clarification. The request is made in a way that is likely to be understood as a genuine request, even if the request itself is not a real question. 
  
  The following are some examples of questions:
- Can you repeat that again? (a question)
 - Do you speak English?  (a request to clarify the meaning of something) 
 - I don't understand. (requesting clarification)

 The following types of acts are questions (in order of decreasing likelihood of being a clarification request):

question, inquiry, clarification, request

  In this case, it is difficult to tell whether the question is genuine or not, because the context is unclear. However, based on your explanation, I believe that this is indeed a legitimate question from the user.

"
721,"Inform is the most common dialogue acts in general conversation. When someone is providing information, they are usually not asking for confirmation or clarification, nor are they making an order or commitment (directive, Commissive or Question). Information is factual and is usually provided by a source (such as a news article or a friend). 
  
Question is another common dialogical act in conversation, but it can also be used in a more directive or commissivo way. For example, when someone asks a direct question such as ""how are you?"". 
   
Directive is used when a person wants to make an action or want to give instructions. An example of directive is when you ask someone to pass the salt.  
 
 commissitive is also another important dialogueact in conversations. A commissative act can be performed in three ways: when one person makes a promise to another person, asking someone for a favor, and making someone an offer.

"
722,"Question: the prediction model is confused by the question mark at the end of the first sentence. 
Inform: this is a factual statement about a person’s physical state. 
  The model does not perceive the statement as a request for information.

"
723,"This text shares information, but does so in a way that does
not fit into a specific category of dialogue acts. The information
is shared about a number that is available in each of 6 rooms,
but does this in such a manner that implies there is a limit to
how many of each item there will be in any given room. While this
text does share information it does it in an ambiguous way, and
therefore does fit the inform category, as this is an example of
sharing information in the ambiguous or unclear way.

"
724,"In the beginning of the message, there is a statement that provides information, ""i had a bad day."" This is an informative statement, as it provides background information that is not seeking an answer or explanation. 
Later in the same message there are two questions, one asking why the author sped up, another asking for the film to be developed. These are questions seeking answers or explanations, so the dialogue acts are classified here as question and directive respectively.

"
725,"Inform is a default dialogue action that indicates that a message has not been specifically addressed to a person. Inform can also be used to indicate that someone else is speaking, such as when a phone rings and a friend is on a call. 
  
Question is the second-most common dialogueact in English, used in about 20% of all conversations. It is used when someone is trying to find out information or make a decision.

"
726,"Inform: the question is asked to provide information, and the answer does not impact the relationship between the two people. 
Question:  the question seeks information from a recipient. 
  Directive: this is the most common type of dialogue acts. When a person is giving orders to another person, they will use the directive dialogue tag. For example, ""Come here!"" or ""Go to the store and get me a box of cereal."" 

 

 commissIVE: This is used when a conversation is ending, but the other person has not yet taken an action. Commissives are not considered to be a good idea in a first conversation.

"
727,"Question: ""Could I put my luggage here for three more days?""
Inform:  ""Of course, you can! We're so happy to have you with us!""

A:
According to the GPT-3 model, this is a Question.

"
728,"This is a Commissive dialogue because it contains information, a
question, and a request for a response. However, it does so in a way
that is not conducive to a conversation, as the request is made in the
middle of a sentence and is followed by a command. 
  
If you would like to check the luggage, please go to the check-in
counter. We will be happy to assist you.

"
729,"In the example above, ""they"" is a person or people, and ""put them"" indicates a command to perform an action. Therefore, this is an example of a commissIVE dialogue. 
  
  In contrast, if ""them"" was a thing, for example a car, then ""you can"" would be a statement of permission, not a direct command.

"
730,"Inform acts are statements or information provided to a person without asking for confirmation or requiring a response. Inform is the most common dialogue acts used in everyday conversation. 
  
Question acts ask for clarification or confirmation. 
Directive acts include commands or instructions. These acts require a clear ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. For example, ""Do you want to leave now?"" or, in the case of a request for money,  ""Give me $20 now.""
Commissive Acts include requests for help or assistance. The recipient is expected to help the asker out. ""Can you help me with this?"" is an example of such a dialogue.

"
731,"the text asks the person to eat some food, indicating that it's a request or order;
it's an order to the food to ""eat more"", indicating a commissIVE dialogueact; and
there is no inform or question in the dialogue, so it falls under the over category.

"
732,"Inform is a prediction that can vary depending on context. In this example, it is considered that inform is the most likely dialogueact because of several reasons. First, ""no"" is an informational phrase that indicates that someone is declining to do something, and the response is simply a confirmation of that. Second, by stating that it was longer their own car than the car suggested, they are providing additional information that could be used to compare the two cars. Finally, this response seems to be part of a larger conversation about dieting, where the person providing the information is on that diet and would prefer not to discuss it further.

"
733,"In the beginning of the message, it appears that this person may be seeking information from the addressee. The person asks a series of questions about the location of a hotel, indicating that they are uncertain of where this location is. 
However, after the first question is asked, this becomes more of an inquiry, with the question of whether the address knows the hotel's location. If the answer to this question was no, then the sender would likely have continued to ask for information, rather than simply asking the next question directly.

"
734,"Question: the callaway street address is not clear from this address. It could be callaways street or callaways street. 
Inform: this is the street where callas is, so callay street is probably a typo. 
  Question + Inform = Information is provided.

"
735,"Callaway Street is a street in a neighborhood in Queens, New York City. Callaway is the name of a golf club. The sentence is attempting to provide the addressee with information, so it has over-informed. 
  
What other source ofenergy doyou use?
This is an open-ended question that does not have a clear answer. Based on context, it seems like the question is meant to solicit additional answers from addressees. However, without context or additional context from other parts of the conversation, this question cannot be answered. Therefore, inform is used.  

"
736,"Inform is a dialogueact that is used for providing general information to a recipient. In this case, 'for about 4 blocks' is not a direct question to the listener, so inform is the most likely dialogueAct. 
Overinform is another possible dialogue Act, but it is unlikely because 'about 4' in '4 blocks over' implies that there is an upper limit, not an exact amount. 
  
Question is also a possibility, as the question mark in the first sentence indicates. However, this sentence does not contain a request for information, only a description of what the sender is doing. So this is more likely a Commissive dialogueACT.

"
737,"Inform is used to describe a conversation in which the speakers provide general information about a topic or event, without asking questions or giving directives. Inform acts are often used in casual conversation, such as when people are introducing themselves to another person.

"
738,"Inform: This is because this is a statement of fact, not a request for confirmation. 
Overinform: Inform is too strict a classification for this dialogueact. This could also be considered a recommendation. 
  Question: this could be classified this way if this was a direct question. However, it is more of a general statement.  
  Directive:  This is the most likely classification, as this acts orders thelistener to do something, and the information provided is an order. Commisive is also a likelyclassification, because it implies that this act was done in consideration of something else. In this case, consideration could mean thatthe listener agreed with this statement, so that it would be easier to follow the instructions.

"
739,"Inform is a polite way of asking someone for information. The speaker in this example is late, and so they are asking their listener for the reason for their lateness. 
  
Out ofinform: This is the correct choice for inform because there is an error, misunderstanding, etc, that is causing the delay.

"
740,"In the example above, we can see that the inform dialogue acts are better than the other two types of dialogue Acts. In particular, it provides information to the receiver about something that has already happened. 
Another example of an inform text:

'I'm sorry to hear that. I'll be more than happy to help you in any way that I can.' 
  'Thank you, Mr. Smith. That's very kind of you.'

"
741,"Question: ""Where to Buy Art Supplies?"" is an open-ended question that invites the response with a description of where one might purchase art materials. The question is followed by a colon, "":"", which is used to separate the first word of the answer. 
  
Answer: Professor Li, where do I buy artwork materials? 
   
Professor Li: I would recommend visiting your local art supply store. They should have a section for artwork supplies.

"
742,"the text does not provide any information on what the asker is looking for, so it is not a request for assistance, and
it is unclear who is taking on painting, if anyone, therefore it cannot be a statement about what someone can or cannot do.

"
743,"In this example, 'i can’t paint' is the information the user is unable to paint, and'she isreally intoit' are the personal weakness the person is unwilling to disclose. The user has asked a direct question of the server, ""can you paint for me?"".

"
744,"In this example, 'how old' is a direct question asking 'How old does your niece live?'. 
  
  The speaker has not shared any personal information, so the question is being posed as an informational query.

"
745,"""actually, I'm going to buy a Good set art  supplies for she as birthday present"" is an informational statement, not a directive or a commissIVE statement. 
  
  The speaker providing the information is not asking the hearer to do anything. The information provided is simply a fact.

"
746,"Inform is the most common dialogue acts category, and it is used to express information or opinions about a topic. Inform acts are often used in casual conversation, but they can also be used when communicating more formally, such as in an email or text message. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissions

Question is one of four types of dialogue Acts. It is asking someone a direct question or asking another person for information, advice, or confirmation. The other three types are inform: inform is information being provided; question: a statement that is requesting information; directive: asking that someone do something. Question and directive are similar in that they both ask for a reply, however, they are different in terms of their purpose. A directive act conveys a command, whereas a query act asks a follow-up question to clarify or confirm something previously stated. Commands are typically given in a commanding tone of voice, while questions are asked in the questioning tone.

"
747,"Question: the dialogue acts that are classified this way are asking questions. In this case, it's likely because the sentence is incomplete, and the missing information could be used to answer the question. For example, if the complete sentence were ""i want to go to chicago"", then this would be classified question because it would likely be a request for information. 
  
Out of Inform: this is a dialogue action that is used when the information provided is out of the ordinary or unexpected. Because the provided information is within the expected context, but does not fit within that context (i.e. it does fit into a larger context), it falls into this category. 
In this example the inform action is likely being used because of a missing period or comma in the previous sentence. Without that period, we do not know what the context is, so it cannot be considered out-of-the-ordinary.

"
748,"Mary is the person being asked about Jenny, and she is not present in the conversation. Therefore Mary is being questioned. 
Jenny is a person who is present, so Mary's absence is what is questioning her.

"
749,"Mary is likely trying to convince the sender that she will take the message. 
She is trying convince Mary that it is not possible for Mary to take Mary's message, because Mary does have a prior engagement.

"
750,"Band practice was moved from Tuesday to Monday. 
This is a change that the receiver of information would likely find surprising. They would be likely to ask questions about why the practice had been changed, and would also likely want to understand the reasons for this change. 
  
In this case, it seems that ""band practice"" was changed from Monday to Tuesday because the band director felt that Tuesday was the best day for band practices, given that there was a basketball tournament on Monday and Tuesday. The director also indicated that they would prefer that practices takeplace on Mondays, since they are typically the day when the members of band are freshest.

"
751,"Question dialogue acts are used when the conversation is about to shift to a new topic, when a request for information is made, and when there is a need to make an offer or a proposal. 
Inform dialogue Acts are generally used for sharing facts or information.

"
752,"Inform is a good dialogueact to use when you are providing or sharing information, and it is the most common dialogueAct in this context. The information provided in the example is about an airport pickup, a common task for which there is no question in asking. 
  
Question is another good choice for this type  of text. However, since the question is not about information sharing, it may be better to rephrase the sentence to make it clear that this is what the person is looking for. For example, ""Do you know the book 'The Man and The Sea' by Ernest Hemingway?"".

"
753,"Mary, who is the one who has the responsibility to take the
boss to the Airport, has not asked a query, given a directive or made a
promise. Therefore, it can also be classified under providing
information.

"
754,"Inform is the most general dialogueact, and is used for sharing information, opinions, requests, etc. without committing to an action. 
  
Question is another general dialogical act, where one person asks another a direct question and the other person has to make an inference or decision based on their knowledge of the situation. In this case, it's likely that $308 is too high a cost for a single night's stay at a hotel, so the question is indicating an attempt to find out more information. 
Directive is also another dialogic act where someone is giving instructions to another person. The directive act in this example is to accept a price for the night. However, this is unlikely to happen, as the price is high and there is no indication that this person would be willing to pay the amount. So, in summary, there's a high likelihood that question was the correct classification.

"
755,"Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive: the  text is requesting information, clarification, instructions, etc. 
Overinform:  the  predicted dialogue  act is too specific, as it only includes inform and commissIVE. Inform is a more general dialogue action, and Commissive is the only one of the four possible dialogue acts that can be used as a response. 
  

Question: how?
Directive : show me the way, let me know how to do it.  (this is an instruction)
Commitment: I will do A, B, C. (this makes a promise) 
   
Inform: ""How?""  is seeking  information or  clarification about  a process, method, or a way  of doing  something.   This indicates  that the   speaker is  asking a  question rather  than providing  or giving information.

"
756,"English is not the native language of most people in Europe. 
Although the question is asked of a non-native speaker, it is still a request for an explanation. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think the answer is that English is the official language in United States, so the person is probably a native speaker.

"
757,"In this example, ""i"" is the subject of the sentence, so the inform dialogue acts are the best. However, there is an additional interrogatory structure in the first sentence (""why""), which indicates the question is being asked by the person speaking.

"
758,"Directive dialogue acts are used when the conversation is focused on a particular action to be taken by the other person. For example, a person may ask another for directions to an address, and if the person giving the directions does so in the form of a command, this would be classified a commissitive (or command) dialogue. 
  
Overinformative dialogueacts are those that are too general, providing little or no information. Inform dialogue is used for information that is provided in an objective or neutral manner. If the informer is not providing enough information, then the questioner will likely ask for more information (question dialogue). 
   
Question dialogueact is when someone asks another person a direct question. A question dialogue can also be used to request information from another. However, if a request for specific information is made in conjunction with a pre-existing request, such as asking someone for their address or asking them to pick a date, that request should be considered commissative.

"
759,"Directive is an inform-question-command dialogue action. The recipient is expected to comply with the command. 
  
In this case, it's asking the person to speak slowly.

"
760,"Question: ""How do I get news about road?""
Inform: This question is asking for road-related information. 
Directive: It is a request for the news to be delivered. 
 Commissive : The news is being delivered, but it is not clear who is receiving the information or what is happening in the background.

"
761,"""i’ve a"" is a possessive pronoun, indicating that ""i"" refers to a ""self""
the use of the word ""mate"" in the sentence indicates the driver is male

In summary, ""I’VE A DRIVER MATE IN MY CAR"" suggests the following dialogue acts:
1. ""Ask for Information"" (inform)
2.  ""Directive""  (directive) 
3.   ""Question""   (question)  
4.    ""Coercion""    (coercive, threat)   
5.     ""Commitment""     (commissive )
6.       ""Inform""       (overinform, inform)

"
762,"Question is the most likely dialogueact in this context, as the question mark at the end of the first sentence indicates the reporter is waiting for a response. Furthermore, ""all the"" in the second sentence could be considered as a summary of what the other news were about, so the reader is expecting a follow-up on this news. Finally, it is a news report, and the use of ""broadcast"" and ""roses"" suggest that this is not a personal conversation, but rather a report of something that happened to someone else.

"
763,"In the first paragraph, ""good morrow"" is used as a way to start a conversation. This is inform because it is not always used at the beginning of text to begin a new conversation, as in ""Good morning.""
""what’s the matte r with yuo?"" is the inquiry part. In this part, we can see that ""you"" refers to a person, so it can be classified here as question. 
  
  The second paragraph is also a dialogue, but the act has changed to question and the answer is ""a"" which refers back to ""what” in the previous paragraph.

"
764,"Question: the dialogue acts of 'can you help me?' are typically used in a conversation to seek information from another person. In this context, 'Can you Help me?', although it is a declarative statement, is used as a form of question. 
  
Overinform: this dialogue action is overused in text classification and is often considered as noise. It is typically seen in the beginning of a dialogue, when the model has not yet fully understood the context of the conversation. For example, it can be seen when a model is being trained on a large corpus of text and the first few sentences of each conversation are not relevant to the current task. 
Quiet: in some cases, a 'Question' dialogue tag can also be assigned to a text if the 'question' is merely a suggestion or recommendation. However, this is rare and should be considered carefully.

"
765,"Directive is a directive dialogueact, meaning it conveys a message to another person to carry out a specific action. In this case, it's telling the waitress to bring apple Pie. 
  
Out of directive: the apple pies are for the customer, not for me. I'm not in any rush, so I'll have to wait. 
Over directive - I want apple PIE, but I don't want to be in too much of hurry. So I'd like to have the pie and eat it later, when I am in no rush to do so.

"
766,"In this example, ""ice cream"" is a request for an optional action. Based on this, this is considered a ""question"" dialogueact.

"
767,"This text does contain a request for information, which is a typical feature of aninformative dialogueact. However, there is also a strong indication that it should be classifiedas question. First, although the word 'question' does appear in the dialogue text twice, only in reference to the requestfor information at the end of the passage, this is not the only occurrence of 'questioh'. The first occurrence is in a phrase that introduces the main topic ofthe passage: ""i need to eat better"". This is followed immediately by a reference that could be interpreted as aquestion, when the doctor says ""are you sure you want to lose weight?"". This suggests that this passage is more than just a simple request ofinformation. 
  
Second, even if the first mention of question is at a later point in time, its presence is still strong evidence thatthis text should also be considered as question-based. In fact, in this case,'should' is the key word. Although the question of whether or not someone should eatbetter is an important one, we cannot assume that all questions are equally important. If we were to assume this, then we would haveto classify all requests for advice as questions, regardless of their importance.

"
768,"Dr. Cooper is the doctor mentioned in the first paragraph, and it would be appropriate for the patient to contact him or her directly for an interview. The patient is likely to be a patient of Dr. Coopers, so it's likely that the appointment request will be directed to him. 
  
If the request was made to a receptionist, then the response would need to indicate that it was the receptionists responsibility to arrange the interview for Dr Cooper.

"
769,"Yes, tomorrow would be fine.

"
770,"In this example, there is a clear indication that the directive dialogue acts are being used. First, 'what about Monday afternoon?' is an invitation to specify a time and a place for a possible meeting. Second, by asking for an appointment, this person is clearly indicating that they are busy and need to be able to fit the meeting into their schedule. Finally, their use of the word 'have' in asking about a'meeting from 9 to 10' indicates that this is likely to take place in a fixed time slot, and that it is important that someone else is available to attend the appointment.

"
771,"Mike is asking you to make another attempt to reach K. He is not fully engaging in the conversation, as he has asked you for a second attempt. 
  

A:
According to the model, ""Mike"" is fully involved in this conversation.

"
772,"Question: I'm not sure, but I think I was invited. 
Information: You may have been invited, however, I do not know for sure. I am not a part of your social circle. 
  I would recommend asking your host or host's host.

"
773,"In this example, we can see that although the information provided is about a shopping trip, there is an action or direction implied in the statement. The speaker wants to make sure they have all the ingredients needed for the meal they want to cook. Therefore, this is a good example of an inform text that also has a direction or instructional dialogueact.

"
774,"""what you're shopping"" is a relative clause that modifies ""you're"" and is therefore not an interrogative pronoun. 
the relative pronoun ""what"" can be used as a noun to refer to something that is specific to the situation in which the relative phrase appears. In this case, ""shopping"" refers to a specific activity that people may engage in when shopping. Therefore, it makes sense to classify the question as being about a person's specific shopping activity. 
  

However, this classification is not definitive. The predicted dialog act could also be classified differently. For example, if the context of use of ""What are  you shopping?"" was in the past, then it could be considered a conditional question. If the ""You're Shopping?"" is used in a present tense context, than it can also considered as general question or even as statement.

"
775,"This text contains a suggestion or offer of new clothing. Based on this, we can classify it as either a directive or commissIVE dialogue acts. 
  
A directive dialogueact is used when someone is giving information or advice to another person. In this case, someone offers to buy the other person new or different clothes, and the receiver of the offer will likely classify this as directive. 
In contrast, a commissitive dialogueacts is when a person asks another for something. Here, they are asking for a specific item, such as money or a book, so the asker is likely to classify the response as commissative.

"
776,"Inform: the message is for the receiver to share information, so the label is appropriate. 
Overinform: this message contains too much information for its recipient, making it overinform. 
  Question: there is a request for information in this conversation, therefore the labels question and directive are applicable.  
Directive: since this is an instruction, command is the correct label.

"
777,"Question dialogue acts are used to seek clarification from another person. In this case, it appears that ""you"" are seeking clarification about something that has just happened to the person speaking. This is a typical use of question dialogue Acts. 
  
Out of the four possible dialogue labels for question acts, ""question"" is the most common. ""Question"" dialogue is used when one person asks another a direct question. For example, a person might ask, “What time is it?” Another person would answer, by stating the time, using a Question dialogue Act. Another type of dialogue used for asking a ""direct"" question is ""indirect question"". An indirect question asks a hypothetical question and is often used in a conversation between two people to solicit an opinion or suggestion from one of them. An example of indirect questioning is,“If you were going to buy a car, what car would you buy?” 
   
In this example the question act ""is asking"" a suggestion or opinion from ""the listener"". The suggestion is that they find something nice for the run-ny-nose person, who is speaking in the conversation.

"
778,"Inform acts convey information, and therefore are often used in situations where the receiver of the message does or does  not know something. For example, an employer might ask an applicant for a job a series of questions to determine if they are a good fit for their company. In this case, if the applicant answers the questions incorrectly, they could be fired. However, in this example the information being conveyed is that the person is a fit, not the question of whether they actually are fit. 
Overinform acts provide too much information. If the sender of an email or text message provides too many details about themselves or their product, this can come off as overly self-promoting and could cause the recipient to delete the email/text message or not purchase the product. 
  
Question acts seek information and are therefore often classified in the other two categories. A question can also be used to request information or clarification. Answering a simple question with a yes or no answer can lead to miscommunication if one person asks a clarifying question and the response is no, when the intended response was yes. Similarly, a direct question that does require a clear answer could lead a person to interpret the directness as meaning that they should answer the  question right away, without giving the asker the opportunity to clarify their intent. Direct questions can often be answered with information from another source, such as another person or a document. Commissive acts are used when a request is made and a reply is expected.  A commissIVE act can include a command, order, instruction, suggestion, etc. but it cannot include the word 'please' or any of its derivatives.

"
779,"This text provides the location of where the speakers got the information about what the two dialogue acts are. This is useful information for the listener to understand the context of these two different dialogue Acts.

"
780,"Inform is associated more with factual statements than with requests for information. The statement ""you just cannot drive"" is not asking for more information, it is stating a fact. 
  
Question is more associated  with requests or requests of information from the listener. In this case, there is neither a request nor a factual statement. Instead, this is an opinion or a suggestion. ""You just cant drive."" is asking the question ""can you drive?"". If the answer is ""no"", then the statement is false. However, if the person can drive, then ""basicaly,  you can just not drive"". This is another factual, not opinionated statement and is classified under inform.

"
781,"Out of question: the dialogue acts question and directive are not applicable here. 
Question: this is not a yes/no question. 
  The text does suggest a recommendation or course-of-action for future action. However, it does so indirectly, through the statement ""you might like it"". This is an indirect question rather than a direct question that can only be answered with a ""yes"" or ""no"".
Directive: there is no action that the sender can direct the recipient to take. This text simply expresses a positive sentiment. Directives are only applicable to requests for action and not to statements of opinion.

"
782,"Directive is the most common dialogue acts for requests. Requests are often made by a person who is in control of something, and they are asking someone else to do something for them. For example, a parent might ask their child to get them a drink from a cupboard. In this example the child is not in a position to refuse the request, so the directive dialogueact is most likely. 
  
Question is another common type of dialogue for request. A question is a way for someone who wants something to express their desire for it. The question could be phrased as a statement, or as an inquiry. An example of a direct question would be ""where did you find them?"". Another example would have been ""do they look old enough to go camping?"" which would likely be framed as statement rather than a query.

"
783,"This text contains a commissIVE command. The speaker is telling the server to give the customer their order. 
  
  The text: ""could you please give my order?"" is asking for information. A question would be:  ""could I have My bill please?"".  A command would include:   ""give my Order!"" or ""serve my food!"".   A directive would indicate:    ""Please take the order and give it to the waitress!""

Note: the classification of a text as a Commissive command does NOT mean that the command will be carried out. Commands are only effective if the other person is able to understand and carry them out!

"
784,"Question dialogue acts are used when the information provided is not sufficient to make a decision, and the questioner is seeking additional information. In this example, xiaoogeng li is asking about the identity of a person who has applied to our solar lab.

"
785,"Out of question: the dialogue acts question and question are more specific than commissives instruction and command. 
Overinform: this is because the information provided is not enough to make an informed decision. The government should lower its price. 
  Question: does the listener want to know more information? 
   Command: is the command or instruction clear? Should the person being instructed do what they are told?

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by William Stuke and John H. Finnegan, there are 6 possible dialogue actions: question (q), inform(i), directive(d), commissIVE (c), command (m), and request (r).  
Question is one of 6 dialogue action.  It is asking a yes/no question.   
Inform is another one. it tells the other person something.    
Directive is telling the another person what to  do.     
Commissive tells someone what action they should take.       
Command tells another to take an action, but it needs to have a clear directive.      
Request tells a person to perform an  action.

"
786,"Question marks indicate that a sentence or statement contains a request for clarification. In this case, 'have youaccepted offersfrom othercompanies?' is a direct question asking whether the interviewee has accepted other offers. 
  

A:
According to this article, ""question"" and ""query"" are the same word in some dialects of English.  In that case the answer to your question is ""yes"".

"
787,"In the above example, inform is the correct classification. The speaker provided information to another person, but did not seek information from that person. In addition, they provided the information in a way that could be evaluated, such as by asking a clarifying question or providing a deadline for an answer.

"
788,"Directives are instructions that are given to someone to do something. In this case, a person is being told to help plan an office event. Directives often include a time frame for when the directive is to take place, so that someone can plan accordingly. 
  
In contrast, questions are inquiries that seek information from another person or group. The recipient of a directive in this example is not being asked to perform any action, but instead is asked a simple question: ""Do you need any help planning the party?"". A question does include an action to which the person asking can respond, however, in the case of planning an event, this action is typically performed by others. Therefore, there is no timeframe for a recipient to plan their own event around.

"
789,"Question dialogue acts are used to request information or advice from another person. In this example, ""red cook carp with rape and mushrooms"" is a request for advice. 
  
Inform dialogue Acts are not used for request, they simply share information without any request. This text falls into the inform category.

"
790,"Inform is used to share general information. The speaker does not want to give too much information or too little, but is simply sharing the information that is currently available to them. In this case, they do not know what type of entertainment the other person would like, so they share that information as well as their best guess. 
  
Question is the most likely dialogueact in this context. Based on what was said before, it appears that the two people are discussing what kind of Entertainment the Other person might like. So the question is likely being asked.  The speaker wants to know if the Othe rperson likes movies, music, sports, or something else.

"
791,"Inform: the given textual content does mention that the taxi driver's strike is again on. However, this does sound like a confirmation rather than a query. 
  
Question:  The textual contents mention the strike of the Taxi drivers is on again, but does it not provide any information on when the next strike will be? It could be a request for further information. 
Directive: It can also be classified under this category as the textual message does provide a clear direction to the receiver to take a particular action. For example, if the sender is asking for the location of a nearby bank, then the response could either be ""The nearest bank is at the mall on Main road"" or ""There is a bank near the railway station"". 
 Committment: However the most important point to note here is that this is not a committe to do anything. This is more of an information provided to someone. So, in this case, we can classify it as Question.

"
792,"A directive dialogue acts are used to express a person's intention or desire to do something. They are typically used in a request or command form. For example, ""Would you please turn off the lights?"" or ""Please pass the salt."" Directive dialogue Acts are not used for sharing personal observations or discoveries.

"
793,"Question is asking a question. 
Out of question: question is used when the information provided is not relevant or cannot be verified. In this case, asking for someone to send a representative to a location is a non-question. 
  
  Question can also be used in a command/request context. However, in this context, there is an explicit request to have someone do a thing, so the question mark is dropped.

"
794,"American Food would probably be a Commissive Dialogue Act, since it is a suggestion to do something, rather than conveying information.

"
795,"""recorded music"" is not a valid response option. The correct response is ""I would like a song from a musical"".

A:
According to this page, ""question"" can also mean ""request"". So it's possible that this is a request for information.

"
796,"the text explicitly asks for a directive response (i.e. a name)
this text could be considered a polite request, where the request is not followed by a negative response

"
797,"the text indicates a desire for a future outting by the addressee, suggesting ""friday"" as the date;
it also suggests that a third party (the sender) is responsible for planning the outings, indicating ""let's each [do our] part"" and ""meet again [on fridays]""; and
by mentioning the name of the person to whom the request is being made (i.e., ""you""), the author is indicating that they are expecting the receiver to comply with the directive and make the effort to attend the suggested outdate.

"
798,"Directive dialogue acts are used to request or order someone else to perform an action. In this case, it is likely that a request for directions was made by the person in question to someone they were speaking to. 
  
In this example, given the context, a directive dialogueact is most likely the intended meaning.

"
799,"This text seems to ask someone a direct question. The speaker starts the sentence with 'what' and then follows with a statement that implies a response. ""i need"" to ""start eating"" healthier. 
  
  This suggests that someone is asking the person they are speaking to a specific question: ""what is thematter?"".  The question implies the asker is curious about the answer, and the statement following the question suggests the response:  ""i'm not sure, but i need starteating healthier.""  In this case, it appears the ""matter"" is someone the listener should eat healthier, so the message is ""you should start eathealthier.""

"
800,"This text indicates the desire for the listener to share a meal with the
speaker. It is a request for information, as the phrase 'what you would like'
indicates that a choice has already been made. 
  
However, this is not a direct question; the question mark indicates a
request for clarification, not an order.

"
801,"Inform is used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision. For example, a person might ask for more information to help them make an informed decision, or to confirm that which they already know. 
  
Question is the most common dialogueact in a conversation. A person may ask a direct question to another person, such as ""are you ok?"" or ""what time is it?"", or they may use a more indirect question form, like ""why is that?"". In a business conversation, questions are often used to find out information from a customer.  

"
802,"Directives are used to express a person's wishes or instructions to another person. In this case, a customer is requesting a lemon to be provided to the florist. 
  
Over-information is when a speaker gives too much information to their listener. The customer in this example is looking for the cost of the rose, and the customer service agent is providing the entire price list. 
Questioning is where a listener asks a specific question of another. Here, there is a request for a price for roses.

"
803,"Inform is a non-verbal communication style that conveys information without asking questions or giving orders. The inform dialogue acts include requests for information, answers to questions, and statements of facts. 
  
Question is the verbal communication pattern that asks a factual question or seeks information to answer a hypothetical question. Question dialogue Acts include questions about the weather, health, directions, etc.

"
804,"In this example, 'where’s the toliet' is a request for information. The speaker wants to know where the nearest toilet is. 
  

A:
According to the model, this is the correct answer: 
Where's  the toilet: ""Things are well for me. I'm in a nice place. You could ask me where is toilet.""

"
805,"""over"" is a preposition that can be used to introduce a location. In this case, ""overthere"" refers to a place that is not here, i.e. another location (euphemism for ""another country"").

In contrast, if ""there"", which refers back to the current location, is used, then the statement would be classified a directive dialogueact.

"
806,"based on this passage, ""inform"" is not a valid dialogueact. the passage does not contain any information that would lead one to believe that the dialogue is being sought. 
the passage is instead asking a series of questions, and each question is answered with another question

A:
According to this article, there are four possible dialogue acts for any given paragraph: irequest, request, order, or command.  The article goes on to say that inform is only valid for inform request and order.

"
807,"In the beginning of the passage, ""believe"" is used as a verb, suggesting that there is an underlying question or statement. ""It's the ten of six, we are already late,"" implies that ""it"" (i.e., the time) is a subject of some sort. The use of ""believes"" as an adjective in ""water is believes the best beverage"") suggests that someone is expressing a personal opinion, so it's possible that this is another statement about opinions. If so, it could be a statement of fact, like ""Water is considered the worlds second favorite beverage after tea.""

If the underlying statement is opinion or fact rather than a direct question about a current event, you could respond with something like this:
""I believe it is ten past six and we already are a bit late but in just case we should lower our offer.""

"
808,"In this example, ""it does,"" which is an affirmation or statement of fact, is followed by ""know it,"" indicating that the statement is likely a clarification or explanation of something previously stated. Additionally, 'that' is used to clarify or explain something, indicating an affirmative statement. Therefore, this is a likely example of a inform response.

"
809,"In this example, inform is the correct classification because it conveys information that is being offered to a listener, rather than asking for information or giving orders. The speaker offers an apology and assures the other party that a similar mistake will be avoided in future, both of which are information-based requests. 
On the contrary, over-inform, under-question, out-of-directive, in-commissive are incorrect classifications of the given dialogue acts.

"
810,"This text provides information to the receiver about why they are late, but does not ask a direct question or make any commitment. The information provided is not particularly important or useful, so the inform dialogue acts are likely over-represented in the model. 
  
On the other hand, this is a very common type of text in email communication, where the information being provided may be of interest to a recipient, even if it is of a general nature. In this case, it may indicate that a relationship of some sort is being established between the two parties, such as a customer-vendor relationship, or that there is some shared interest between both parties that motivates the communication.

"
811,"Eyebrows raise when we read text that is over-informative. Inform text is one that provides information to a recipient, without asking any questions or giving any directives. When the information provided is too detailed or detailed for the context, it is considered overinformational. 
  
  Ebay, as an online marketplace, is full to bursting with items for sale.  It is difficult to find a specific item when you are searching for it. However, if you know what you want, you can narrow your search by browsing the categories. For example, I might search for ""table"" and find many listings. But if I search ""chairs"" I only find listings of that specific type of chair. This is an example of overinformativeness.

"
812,"This text appears to ask a direct question to the receiver. The sender appears interested in the answer to this question and is therefore seeking confirmation from the intended recipient. 
However, this is not the only possible interpretation of what is happening here. It could also be that this message is part of a larger conversation, where the question is posed by the other party to get the attention of their interlocutor. In this case, it is the person sending the message who is interested to know the size of bed that is being preferred.

"
813,"the text asks a direct question about where pots & pans can usually be found, indicating the speaker is looking for an immediate answer

This makes the question dialogueact label more accurate.

"
814,"""pans and pots are over here"" is an example of over-information, as it provides too much information without providing any value. 
On the contrary, ""pens and pencils are next to your desk"" would be considered under-informative, because it does not provide any context or additional information to what was said before.

"
815,"Inform is a non-verbal communication style that is used to request or provide information. In this case, ""yep"" was used informally to confirm that ""hey"" had been received.

"
816,"Directive is a dialogueact that is used to express a request or order. In this case, it is being used in the sense of'request or demand'. The speaker wants the listener to do something, and the directive act conveys this request in a polite way. 
  

'Please interest him in ours.' 
 'Please demand that he come over and eat with us.'

"
817,"In the example provided, KARA does ask an open-ended question. The question is ""what do you have?"". KARA then provides a response with a description of Mike's current state. This is an example of a declarative statement, where KAra is stating a fact. Mike does have a wallet, keys, phone, etc.

"
818,"Out ofinform: the card company asks the customer for his credit-card number. 
Question: does the user have a creditcard?
Directive: provide your credit cards details. 
 Commissive : the company will charge the 10% discount if the users provide his card details

A:
According to the GPT-2 model, your answer is correct.

"
819,"'it’s free' is a statement, not a request for information. 
It is not asking a recipient for confirmation or a confirmation request. 
  Therefore, this is an informative dialogueact.

"
820,"In this example, we can see that this is a directive dialogueact, as the message is asking the recipient to do something (apply for a job).

"
821,"This text is asking a follow-up question to an earlier statement, so it is classified here because it contains a commissIVE clause. 
  
  The earlier text provided information, ""it is ten past six"", which implies that the question is about time. The receiver of that text can infer that ""you are probably late"", so the second text asks a direct question.

"
822," commissives are used to express strong feelings or opinions, and are often used in a commanding or dictatorial manner. For example, a boss might use a commissIVE to communicate that they will be taking a personal day to attend to a family emergency. 
  
overinform, overquestion, outofdirective,overcommissive: these are the four possible combinations of the words in the above dialogue acts. The first two indicate that another action is possible or appropriate, while the latter two are strong indicators that something is not right. In this case, we believe that overinform and out ofdirectivity are both true, since the information being shared is clearly not relevant to the question being asked.

"
823,"Directive acts are used when the information provided is not for the sake of providing it, and is instead meant to cause a certain response from another person. For example, a person might ask another to do something, make an announcement, inform another of something that is happening, etc. 
  
In this case, it is clear that this is a directive act, as the caller is asking the office to contact the police.

"
824,"This text indicates the need for the information provided to be accurate. The person asking the question is likely concerned that they may have been exposed to something harmful, and the asker is trying to confirm this. 
  
  The text also indicates a desire for a response. It is unclear from this short exchange whether the inquirer is interested in a reply or simply wants to move on from their question; however, this is also an indication of the dialogue acts of question and request.

"
825,"""i forgot"" is an example of a commissIVE message, as it conveys a message that is meant to remind the listener of something they were previously told. In this case, ""i forget"" could be considered a way to apologize for a previous action. 
  
  The text also includes the word ""now"", which can be used to indicate a time or a place. ""Now"" can also be a directive message to someone to do something at a particular time. The recipient of ""n now"" might interpret this as a request for immediate assistance, rather than a simple statement of fact.

"
826,"Directive is a dialogue acts that is used when someone is asking someone else to do something. In this case, 'let’s go' is being used as a request to go to another location. Based on this context, it is likely that 'a couple of dozen' and'some orange' are additional requests. 
  
Out of directive: Inform, ask, give, make a committment, request, command

Inform: is the dialogue action of providing straightforward information, answers to questions, and instructions. 
Question: asks someone to clarify or elaborate on something, but does not require a response. For example, ""why did you do that?"".  If the question is answered, there is no need to ask again. If the answer is ""I don't know"", then a ""who, what, when, where, why"" question would be ""what did the person do?""
  Directives are used to give orders, instructions or requests to someone or something else. They are not questions. Commands are questions that are answered with commands. ""yes"" is an answer to the command ""are you sure?""

"
827,"""why’d youpull meover?"" is a request for an explanation, indicating that this speaker would prefer to guide the direction of the interaction. 
On the other hand, ""let’s getfrozen juice is good, we’ve gotenough food, let’slet’smove overto thecheck-out stand."" is an invitation to engage in a cooperative activity, where the participants are expected to work together to achieve a shared goal. 
  In this case, it would be more appropriate to classify the dialogue as cooperative rather than directive.

"
828,"the text is asking the listener to do something, so it is commissIVE
there is an indication that there is more than one option available to the interlocutors, therefore it can be question or directive
it is not clear from the context whether the cooking oil is to be used for cooking or for frying, this is why the directive and question dialogue acts could be applicable

A:
According to your explanation, it seems that you are right. However, I would like to point out that in this case, there isn't any indication in text that oil should be fried. So, based on your explanations, both question and directive are applicable.

"
829,"the text asks for permission to speak to a particular person,
it is a request for action (the person who receives the request must take action),
and it is an instruction or suggestion (i like to purchase weed when it becomes available).

"
830,"Out ofinform: the conversation starts off with greetings, then the professor asks the student a direct question about their plans for the weekend, this is not a typical conversational pattern. 
Overinform,question: although the beginning of conversation is normal, it then switches to a more question-like pattern, where the question is asked after the answer to the previous question has already been given. 
  This is also not typical.  
Directive: there is a clear command in the form of a request for action, such as ""come with me"" or ""write down that number"". 
   This type of command is typically only found in conversations between two people who are directly addressing a third party, for example, a boss to their employee. Commands are not typically used in casual conversation.   
Commissive, Commissive (or commissorial): the pattern is similar to directive in that there's a clearly stated request, but it's also a pattern that is used for expressing opinions and making commitments. In this case, professor Clark is expressing his opinion that the students should go to dinner with him, making a recommendation.

"
831,"In the above text the word ""professer"" has a positive connotation, so the dialogue acts of professor and i are considered to be positive. 
However, in this context, ""kalina"" does sound like a negative word, and the dialogues act in question is considered negative.

"
832,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask for clarification or to request an explanation. In this example, it looks like the person asking for help is not sure about something, and so they are asking a clarifying question. 
  
Out of question: the question is asked in the context of a request for assistance, not a clarification. The request is for someone else to help, rather than for the asker to clarify something for themselves.

"
833,"In this example, inform is the correct classification because it is possible to infer information from the statement. The statement provides the information that the car hit atree and that it caused damage. This information is not asked for, given, promised, commanded, etc. Therefore, based on this information alone, one could conclude that there was a collision. However, there are other factors that can affect the time it takes to fix the damage, and the fact that this statement is merely informative doesnot mean that a car collision did not occur.

"
834,"This text does appear to provide information and clarification rather
  than asking or giving commands or promises. ""Oh, My God!"" is a common
phrase used to express surprise or concern, neither of which it would
be used in a conversation to ask for information. Additionally, it
provides a clear explanation of what the sour-peppercorn soup is,
characterizing its flavor.

"
835,"Inform is a non-committal response that provides background information and does
not commit the responder to take any specific actions. 
Question is an affirmative response to a statement or question that
invokes a response with a counter-question. 
  For example, ""Are you sure you want to do that?""
Overinform is the opposite of Inform, where the response provides too much
information. For example ""I'm so excited about this that I can't contain
myself!""
Commit is where a respondee makes a decision or commitment.  ""I'll do it!"" 

 

A:

I think the answer is that it's a request for information. The speaker wants to know how the other person feels about the situation they are in.

"
836,"Question: This text asks a follow-up question to the first question: ""Don't
worry, Young Man. Let Me Take An Examination."" The question is ""How Much
School Will You Miss?"". This is an example of asking an open-ended question
that is considered a ""question"" because it is looking for an answer. 
  
Overinform:  The text states that ""don’t worry"" and then asks ""Young Man"" to answer the question ""how Much School Will  You Miss"". This provides too much information.  It is redundant and should be removed. 
Questions: What does ""let me"" mean? Does the doctor have permission to examine the student? What is the examiner looking to find? Is the exam going to be painful? The student may not want to have an exam. Does this exam have a time limit? 

 

Directive:   The doctor is telling the patient what to do. ""Open your Mouth""  and ""Say Ahh"". The doctor has given instructions. He is asking the  patient to follow instructions, so the act should also be classified  as directive.   

Commissive : The exam is painful and the time is limited. So the examination is going take longer than expected. the examinee will have to miss school. so this act can also classified a commissitive act.

"
837,"Inform is a low-level dialogue action that indicates a general topic or suggestion for conversation. The inform dialogue acts are typically used in the beginning of a conversation to set the scene or to introduce a new topic. In this case, it is used to suggest that we should go to dinner now. 
  
Overinform is when the dialogue  actor gives too much information.  In this example, inform is overinform because the  speaker is providing more details about when they will go out to eat than is necessary. 
Question is the lowest level of dialogue, asking a direct question to the other person. Here,  the question is ""why not take the week of vacation now?"".   
Directive is an instruction to do something. ""Go to dinners now"" is directive. Directives are used when someone is giving orders.    
Commissive are promises or statements of intent. These are the hardest for computers to understand. For example ""I only want you to go on vacation this year if you promise to buy me a gift."".

"
838,"In this case, it is likely that i-was-called-by-you was the correct classification. The call-telling-me-that-i-won’t-be-in-class text provides no information about the reason for i’s absence. Therefore, inform is a better prediction than overinform,question,directive,commissive.

"
839,"Question: ""How bad Did I Do?""
Out of Inform: This text does not provide any information to the receiver. 
question: Did you run a stop sign? 

 

Directive:  The speaker in this example is asking the other person for a phone  number. 
  

Informative: It appears that the sender is providing some information, but it is unclear what the information is. For example, it could be a comment about how the conversation is going, or a recommendation for how to respond.

  


 commissIVE: There is no commissitive act in the example text. The example appears  to be asking for an assessment of the driver's performance. However, this act could also be interpreted as a directive. In this case, ""assessment"" would be an evaluative term, and the request is for someone to evaluate the performance of another person. This act would not be commissived because it does  not include a time frame or any commitment from either person to act out the directive in a specific way. Therefore, based on this information and this dialogue, I predict that this is likely a commissively asked question

"
840,"the text asks a direct question: ‘can’t complain.’. 
it is a declarative statement, not an interrogative one. 
  The text does ask an indirect question by using the word ‘and’ before the last sentence. However, this is not necessary for the classification of the dialogue acts.

"
841,"Question asks for confirmation from the other person. 
In this case, it is the sender asking the questioner if the latter is free for a meeting next Wednesday. The question is not clear, as the context doesnot provide enough information to answer it. 
  

Overinform: the message is too long and contains unnecessary information. In this example, ""how ’s your schedules looking?"" is overinformative, because it does no add value to the conversation. Instead, a simple ""your schedules looks good"" would have been sufficient.  
 
Out of question: this is because the request is in form of an order, not a request. This is indicated by the use of ""you"" in front of verb ""want"". 
   
  Commissive: inform, direct, order are the possible dialogue acts for this context. However, since the order is given in terms of wants, rather than needs, this request falls into the commissIVE category
   
 

"
842,"Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that indicate that a party is giving an instruction or direction to another party. The instruction can be to do something, to take an action, etc. Directives are typically used when there is an established relationship between the two parties, such as when one party pays another for services. In this case, it is reasonable to assume that there would be a pre-existing relationship of some sort between you and the individual you are communicating with, since you would likely be paying them for their services, whether it be for a date, a meal, an interview, whatever. 
  
In this example, 'let' is used as a verb to indicate the direction or instruction. 'I can' would have been a request, but 'can' indicates permission or ability. Therefore, this is most likely a direct instruction to the other party, who is 'out' in the example.

"
843,"Inform is the most common dialogueact in text messages, with question being second. Inform acts convey information without requiring a reply, a request, an order, etc. They are often used when the message is not a direct request for a service or action, such as when a friend is expressing interest in a topic or when an employer is sending a message to a prospective employee.

"
844,"Question is a sub-class ofinform that is used to ask about information or facts. In this case, ""slow asa snails"" is the information that has led to the classification of the dialogue acts asquestion. 
In addition, there is an embedded question mark at the end of that sentence. This is another indication that this sentence is being used as an interrogation.

"
845,"Question dialogue acts seek information from the other person, and are used when the speaker is looking for agreement or confirmation from another person. In this case, we can assume the author is seeking confirmation that the reduction of energy in a factory is successful. 
Overinform dialogue Acts provide too much information to the listener, making it difficult for the receiver to understand the actual message. The author of the message is expressing satisfaction about an achievement, but provides too many details about it, so the details make it hard for a listener to grasp the achievement.

"
846,"Overinform: the sender is giving too much information, and therefore the receiver is unable to respond appropriately. 
Question: there are no questions in the dialogue, however the message is seeking information. 
  Directive: this is a command, asking the person to do something.  
Commissive : this means to make a promise, agreement, etc. and this message does not contain any promises or agreements.

"
847,"the text implies a request for a service (checking if the mail server is working) and a direction to take a specific action in response to this request (calling the IT department);
it does so by using the word ‘ better ’ (which is an imperative form of the verb to better), which implies an order or an indication that the suggested action is the best one;
although the request is for service, there is no indication of who is requesting the service or what for (the IT dept. is just suggested as a possible service provider); 
there is also no new or additional information provided in the sentence (it is not necessary to send the mail, we can check if it works by calling the server). 
  

In summary, this is most likely a direct request and direction for the action of checking if one’s mailserver is functioning.

"
848," commissives are often used when someone is being overly directive or
commissive, and they tend to use the other person as a means to an end. For
example, a commissIVE person might tell another person what to do, even if
that person doesn't want to hear it. A commissived person is also often
angry or upset, so they might use a Commissive dialogue tag even when they
are not truly Commissived.

"
849,"Directive is the most specific dialogueact, as it indicates a one-time action. In this case, a conversation. 
Overinform is a dialogue action that indicates the information provided is too general. This is because the conversation is about more than just one thing. 
  
Question is another specific type of dialogueaction, and it's because this statement could be interpreted as a yes/no question. However, there is no context in the given text that would make this a valid question

There are other types of specific and less specific types, but this should be enough to explain the classification.

"
850," dad is the speaker in this conversation, and he is requesting that I do his homework for him. Based on this, we can infer that he expects me to perform some action (i.e., do homework) on his behalf. Therefore, he has asked me for help, rather than simply providing me with information.

"
851,"This text contains statements that are statements of fact, where one person (the speaker) is stating that they did something (went to Cram School last nigh) and another person agrees with that statement (honey). This is not an example of question asking, because there is nothing being questioned. The statement is simply a fact that is being agreed upon. 
  
However, it does contain a request for an explanation, so the question mark is added.

"
852," dad, I don’t want talk to you about that now, because I’m busy. 
This text shows that the dialogue acts of dad and I are overinform and question. The first part of I's response is an overinformativenon-statement, and the second part is a questioning statement. 
  

I don‘t know why you donʼt talk with me about this now because you are busy, but I am busy too. I would like to help only when I can.

"
853,"In this example, ""you should"" is the command or order, and ""tell me"" the request.

"
854,"""but i"" indicates that the next part of sentence is an explanation or a counterpoint to the previous part. In this case, ""but"" is used to express the opposite of what was said before. 
Cram school is similar to prison, where you have no freedom and are forced to study. I would not want my son to go there. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, you are right that this is indeed a commissives.  The reason is that ""i"" in the second sentence indicates the same person as in first sentence. So the meaning of second ""But i..."" is ""However, I..."".

"
855,"Question is one of the most common dialogue acts. When used correctly, a
  question can be a very useful tool to help the listener understand the
personally relevant information from the conversation. However, when
used incorrectly, questions can lead to a lot of confusion and
frustration for both the sender and the receiver. 
  
In this case, we believe the question was used incorrectly. The
predicted dialogueact is question because it asks a listener to explain
why the information given in the previous text is wrong. In this
particular case however, there is nothing personally relevant in this 
information that would make it wrong, so the answer to this question
would be nothing. Therefore, this is not a good use of question and we
are going to classify this as wrong use.

"
856,"the text is not asking or giving a direct command. It is instead sharing information from a memory. This indicates the inform dialogue acts. 
although the doctor is a person, they do not have the physical ability to give you a clear look of the document. So the directive dialogue is applicable here.

"
857,"Question: Yes, I do. I'm afraid I got a bit too excited and drove though a Red Light. 
  Inform: That's not surprising, you're a young adult. You're likely still learning the rules of driving.

"
858,"This text contains information that is not normally found in a dialogue. For example, it does mention asking a person for help or assistance, and the asker is clearly interested in the outcome of the help they are asking. 
  
  Based off of these facts, this is a non-verbal question and should be classified under question rather than inform.

"
859,"Mike is suggesting a place and time for us to meet. He is directing K. where and when to appear. 
This is a clear directive act, where Mike is telling K what to do.

"
860,"In this example, ""believe"" is an auxiliary verb that indicates the speaker is expressing an opinion or feeling. The speaker believes that tea should be the number one beverage after all. However, this is just an assumption and the actual answer to this question is not known. Therefore, it is considered as a statement rather than a request for information. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think that your text contains a sentence that is questioning.  The sentence is ""What's the weather like?""  This is because ""weather"" can mean both weather and temperature.

"
861,"Directive is used when a person is being ordered to do something. In this case, staying inbed and drinking a large amount of fluids is ordered by the author of that text. 
Overinform is when someone provides too much information. Here, there is not much guidance in this statement and the information provided is just to stay hydrated. 
  
Question is another type of dialogueact used to seek information, clarification, and advice.  In this example, a follow up question is asked, 'what if I can’t deal?'. This indicates that there may be more information needed to be provided to fully understand the situation and that this is the question the reader is left with.

"
862,"Question: This text contains a potential question. The first sentence, ""can you play?"" is a conditional question that implies that John may be able to play if the answer is yes. 
  
  Inform: However, this is not a yes or no question; it's a statement of fact. John is able and willing to perform the action of playing football, so the question is redundant. 
Directive: But the second sentence implies the opposite, that 4 out of the 7 footballs are damaged. So the request to send a player to John's location is implied.  This is an example of directive dialogue.

"
863,"This text uses the word ""apologize"" which typically indicates a command. 
There is also no mention of any action being taken by either party, so it is not an example of providing informational information.

"
864,"This text is a request for information. However, instead of providing the requested information in a direct manner, such as ""give me the report,"" the information is being requested indirectly. ""Give me your report"" would be a more direct request. This is an example of a commissIVE dialogue.

"
865,"""whatwerethey?"" could be a reference to a conversation that took place between the two people, in which case the question mark indicates a request for clarification. 
It could also be an indirect question about what the other person was doing, or what they were going to do, but the use and structure are more consistent with an inform question than a direct or commissIVE question

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue: A Puzzle of Words"" by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, there are four basic types of questions: question/exclamation, exclamation/question, command,  and directive.  The book is very good and worth a read.

"
866,"Question dialogue acts typically share information that is ambiguous or incomplete. The speaker is looking for an answer to a query or clarification on a point being discussed. In this case, ""i was just wondering"" indicates a lack of clarity on what the recipient should do next, so the question dialogueact is appropriate. 
  
In contrast, inform and directive are used when the information shared is clear and unambiguous. ""Put your hand behind the head"" is a command, not a suggestion or question. Similarly, a commissitive dialogue action is used for a promise or commitment.

"
867," commissives are often used when someone is requesting something from another person. For example, a commissIVE text might read:

""I'm hungry. Can you buy me dinner?""
In this example ""buy me"" is the commissived request. 
  
  In contrast, informatives are used to express that you want to share something with someone. An informative text would read, for example: 
I was thinking about you while I was working today. I hope you were able to relax. 


"
868,"Question is one of five possible dialogue acts. It is used to ask a direct question to the other person. 
In this case, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the information provided is about a personal concern. However, there is a possibility that question could be the correct classification, if the question is more of a general inquiry than a specific concern for this person, for example, ""are you getting anything special for your birthday?"".

"
869,"Inform is characterized by providing information to a recipient. The sentence ""i wish i could get you some Pie"" is an example of providing factual information. 
Question is another type of dialogue acts. In this case, it is used to seek clarification from a source. ""Do you think i can get any Pie?"" would be an instance of asking a query. 
  Question can also be used as a way to give instructions.  ""Please get me some PIE"" would fall under this category as well. A command is also another form of directive. This is because the sentence is telling the recipient to do something.   ""Get me PIES"" 
 Commands are used when a person is giving orders to another person. For example, ""Take off your shirt."" ""Get off the pot.""  This is where the inform and question dialogue Acts come into play. These are the facts that were provided earlier in this sentence. So the command comes into action when the person being commanded is not able to understand the information provided.

"
870,"Question: ""What kind pie?""
Answer: I would like a chocolate pecan pie.

"
871,"Inform is used when someone is providing general information, and the receiver is free to ask questions. In this case, it's likely that the information provided is not particularly interesting or useful to the reader, so they may choose to ignore it. 
  
Overinform is when the person providing the info is being too verbose, providing too much information. The receiver may then choose not to listen to what the source is saying, because they are likely to be interruptions. 
Question is a request for an explanation or clarification. If the asker is unclear about something, they will likely get a more detailed explanation from a listener who is more familiar with the topic.  If the listener is unable to answer, then the question is likely going to get lost in the shuffle. Commisive is where the conversation moves to a different topic, but there is still a lot of communication happening between the two parties. For example, if the speaker is giving a recommendation for a movie, a commisitive response might be ""I'll watch it when I get home.""

A:
According to this article, ""The Dialogue Act Scale"" by Robert C. Wysocki, there are five possible dialogue acts: question; directive; inform; request; and command. Based on your example text:  question; question ; inform;inform.

"
872,"In this example, ""do You want To know What kind Of Pie I Like?"" is considered as the question dialogue acts. The question mark at the end of ""Do You Want To Know What Kind Of PIE I LIke?"" indicates that the answer to this question is ""yes"". This indicates the presence of a ""question"" in this message. 
  
However, this is not the only way to interpret this sentence. Another way of interpreting this statement is that ""Yes, I would like to learn what type of Pie you like."". In this case, there is no question in the statement, and the dialogue is instead considered to be directive. This is because ""want"" is used in conjunction with the word ""to know"". In other words, in order to find out what Pie the person likes, they need to ask.

"
873,"Question: I'll go to check for the preferences of you. 
Over Inform: Sir, I would like to know what you prefer. 
  Question : What kind of bed do u prefer? 

 
Sure, you can go for a standard bed or a king size. I prefer a regular bed myself.

"
874,"Apple pie is an item of American cuisine. The inform dialogue acts are typically used when providing information to a listener. In this case, 'i' is providing the information that 'Apple Pie is delicious.' 
  
Question is used to seek information from a person. 
   
Directive is typically expressed when someone is trying to achieve a goal or influence a decision.  In this example, it is likely that ""i"" is asking ""Do you need any help?"".

"
875,"""oh i Love apple Pie too"" is an example of an inform statement which simply conveys information without asking a direct question or giving a command.

"
876,"A commissIVE dialogue acts are used to express a command or order. They are typically used when the information provided is not sufficient to make an informed decision. For example, a commissively spoken command might be ""go to the store and get milk"". This command is only partially informed, so it requires the recipient to go to a store in order to obtain the requested information.

"
877,"the text starts with a directive structure (""let us go""), which indicates the intention of the sender to communicate something to the receiver
based on this directive sentence, it can be inferred that there is a follow-up question in mind, since the question mark is placed right after the directive word ""go""
after the interrogatives ""are"" and "" why,"" the next sentence contains a direct question (""are we more a lead or follower?"")

A:
According to your explanation, you are right. The predicted dialog act for this passage is directive.

"
878,"This text contains a commitment from the speakers to provide information or assistance to the recipient. The recipient is not explicitly identified, but it is implied that he or she is the addressee. 
In addition, this is a request for assistance, so the commissivity label is also applicable.

"
879,"Question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates a
  question. The sentence is requesting information from a person, and
the person is being asked to confirm something.

"
880,"This text could be seen as asking for information or clarification, but it could also be considered a suggestion or offer. If the latter, then the question mark could indicate that there is a possibility that this information could change or that it is an invitation to a negotiation. In this context, it would be more appropriate to classify the dialogue acts in question and inform as directive and question as commissives.

"
881,"Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the most likely. The first sentence of your example text states that your bank ""is authorized"" to handle foreign exchanges. Based on this information alone, it seems likely that you are providing information to the bank, rather than asking a direct question or making a request. 
  
However, there is also a second sentence in which the author asks a follow-up question: ""would you like to know the exchange rate?"" This suggests that he is attempting to gather information from the reader, and is therefore classified under question.

"
882,"In this example, there is an informational text that provides general information, but the response asks a follow-up question that is not answered in the informational portion of text. The response is therefore classified under question because it is a request for clarification.

"
883,"Out of question: this is a request for information and does NOT classify as informing. 
Over question (questioning the information): this does classify, but it's a questioning that is intended to provide additional information to the conversation. In this case, we can assume that this question is meant to elicit an answer from the listener. 
          The text: ""there are a few kinds"" is an over question. The question here is ""are there three or four kinds?"". If the answer is no, then the question would be over. However, if the response is yes, there are three different kinds: usdtjapananeseyendollarhk. Then the over would not be necessary.

"
884,"Directive is the most negative dialogue acts and is used when someone is asking someone to do something against their will. In this case, we are seeing the use of directive when the question of the rate of exchange of US dollars to Indian rupees is being asked. The response of 'what the Exchange rate is' is against the will of asking the person the actual rate. 
  
Out of question: the given statement is not a direct question but a request for information. This is an example of out of query dialogue. Out of Query is one of four basic types of dialogue Acts in which the conversation flows between two people without any explicit request or command from either side.

"
885,"Inform is an action that provides information to the other person. In this case, it seems like the seller is providing information about the buying process. This is because the buyer is being asked to make an offer, and the offer amount is not very high. 
  
Question is another action to seek information from the environment. It seems that in this situation, there is something that is unclear about what the price is for the item. Therefore, a query is made to find out more information.  

"
886,"When the US dollar is mentioned, there is a direct request to switch to another currency. 
There is also a request that is not directly related to the topic at hand, but is instead a comment on how the conversation is going. The speaker wants to know why they keep switching back and forth between two currencies.

"
887,"Directive is a dialogue-ending act that conveys a message to another person or entity. In this case, it is conveying a request to go see the currency exchange desk. 
  
In contrast to inform and question which aim to provide information and seek confirmation, respectively, a directive act aims at conveying instructions or a demand to a recipient to carry out an action in a specific way. The act may also include a commitment from a sender to take some action, such as sending a letter or making a phone call.

"
888,"Inform is used when the dialogue partner is sharing information. In this case, Mike is not asking any questions, but is instead sharing the information that he has observed about himself and his current state. This is an example of informational dialogue. 
  
Overinform is when a dialogue participant asks a lot of questions. Here, it appears that Mike has asked a series of question about his health, and this classification is likely incorrect.

"
889,"In this example, ""the man"" is likely a salesperson, and the ""man responsible"" for ""selling typewriter"" could be the sales person's boss. In this case, it's likely that the boss is responsible, not the type-writer salesman. 
So the correct classification is: inform

"
890,"In this example, Steven is acknowledging the knowledge of a colleague, who happens to be a sales representative. In the context of business, it is considered good form for a manager to acknowledge the accomplishments of their subordinates.

"
891,"In this example, 'only five type writers work' is overinformative, as it does not provide any additional information about the problem. The speaker could have simply said 'five of the ten type-writers work', which would be more concise and informative. 
Similarly, if the typewriter issue was a hardware issue, rather than a software issue (which is what the example text seems to imply), the statement'only 5 of 10 typewritters work'would not be very helpful. 
  
Question: Why is only '5 of ten working' informative?
Answer: Because the question is about providing additional context or information. In this case, it is unclear why only a certain number of typewritten work, and the answer to this question would provide this information to help the reader understand the issue.

"
892,"Inform is a dialogueact that is used when the other party is acknowledging or realizing information that has already been provided. In this case, 'oh' is the information, and the 'I'm Sorry' part of 'Oh, I'mSorry aboutthat.' is an acknowledgment of that information.

"
893,"Question: ""what are  you going  to do  about it?""

This question is requesting clarification regarding something mentioned in-between. In this case, ""it"" refers to the statement ""i will Graduate from Peking University this July."" The question ""What are You Going to Do About It?"" is a request for an explanation of the meaning of a statement. 
  
Never mind: being  sorry,  what  are  You  going  do  About  It?

"
894,"In this example, ""yep?"" can also be classified under question. However, in this case, there is a strong implication that ""Yep?"" is not a genuine question but rather a form of greeting or greeting back. In addition, this is an affirmative statement, so it should be considered as affirmative response. 
  

A:
According to the GPT-2 model, yep? is considered a greeting.

"
895,"""I hope that you’ll make it sure it wouldn’t happen a second time."" is a statement of hope, and therefore falls into the directive category, as opposed to the other four categories.

"
896," commissives are often asking questions, and they tend to give orders or suggestions. In this case, it appears that this is a request for information from the person the message is addressed to, so it is classified here as a commissIVE. 
  
directives, on average, are more directive and less inquiring than are questions. The directive act in this example is telling the asker to look up how to do something, suggesting that person do that thing. It is not asking or seeking information, but rather giving orders. Therefore, this act has also been categorized as directive in the above paragraph.

"
897,"overinform: the prediction is too specific, as it only includes the inform and question dialogue acts. 
question: there is a request for confirmation, indicated by ""will that""
directive: a directive act was predicted, with a label of commissIVE
commissive : a commissitive act has also been predicted

A:
According to your explanation, there are two cases:  inform and non-inform. In the first case, you are right. The second case is not included in the explanation.

"
898,"Directives are statements that ask for an action to take place. For example, ""Call the plumber"" or ""Come over here and give me a hug.""
Commands are requests for action that are not followed immediately. ""Go to the store and buy some milk."" or  ""Please pass the salt."" 
  
In this case, 'I'm' is a subject, and the rest of the sentence is the verb. The subject 'Am I looking' asks a direct question. 
   
'Yes, Chinese love tea' and 'Some claim that they cannot live with out it' are the information provided by the subject.

"
899,"In the first sentence, 'what price' is an open-ended question that invites the customer to provide a price. 
However, in the second sentence the question is narrowed down to a specific price, so the expected response is 'yes sir, what is the price for the largest size?'. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think the answer is ""question"" because in second part of the sentence ""price range"" is specified.

"
900,"'i don’t know' is a statement of uncertainty, so the inform dialogue
  act is the best choice. 
Over-interpreting the statement as a request for information would
   be incorrect, as the question dialogue acts are for questions that
ask for more information.

"
901,"This text uses the directive act to request that Kara go on another date. The sender states that they enjoyed the first date and would they like Kira to take them out on a second date? Kiera agrees and the two go to a movie.

"
902,"This text contains a ""question"" (i.e., it is a request for information) because it asks the question ""do you still want to know about room prices?"". 
It is also a directive (requesting a response) since the ""yes"" or ""no"" answer is the response that is being requested. 
  
However, it also contains an inform dialogue tag (the speaker providing background information to the receiver about what they're saying), which is considered to be a more general type of dialogue. Therefore, this is classified under question as a general question that contains some information.

"
903,"the text is asking information, since it does so in a situation where a price reduction is expected
it is giving information in response to a previous statement, so it should be classified under inform
there is no directive or commissIVE in this statement

Note that the classification of a statement as question or inform is an educated guess based on how the words in that statement are used in context.

"
904,"""how"" is a relative term, so the question mark is not indicating the start of a new sentence. It is part of the same sentence as ""that one"".
the question is asking for clarification. ""how that is one"" could mean either ""what is the price of one"", or ""is one the cost of two"". 
  

Since the dialogue acts are not mutually exclusive, there is some degree of uncertainty in the classification. However, based on this example, ""question"" would be the most likely classification for this dialogueact.

"
905,"In this example, we can see that predict_dialogue_act returns inform because the prediction is based on information in the provided text. The predicted text is nonsmok ing. n o t s moking. n now, is t a q u e n t - s i z e b a d y. t h e s e d o cuments provide the information that queen size beds are more expensive than other bed types. Based on this information, predict dialogue act returns the label inform.

"
906," commissives are used to express a request for information or clarification. In this case, it indicates the speakers desire for a response from their conversation partners. 
question dialogues are often used when the information provided is not sufficient to make a decision. The question dialogue acts ask for more information, and the inform dialogue is used for when all the necessary information is provided. Here, both question and inform are appropriate. However, in this context, there is insufficient information to determine a clear course or action. Therefore, a commissIVE is appropriate, asking for clarification or additional information from your conversation counterpart.

"
907,"This text is asking a direct question about today’s sale. The question mark at the end of the sentence indicates a potential question. However, this is not an informational question; it’d be an interrogative question if it were to be followed by an answer. 
  
If the question is answered, then the dialogue will shift to another act, for example, answer or command.

"
908,"the text asks for specific information (models you've got)
and the response is expected to contain that information
so the dialogue acts are question and directive

A:
According to the model, you can use the following dialogue Acts to describe the context: 
Question: Can you give me some examples of models?  and                               Answer: Yes, I can tell you about some models.                                                         Here, John is giving examples. 
                                                                         Question : Can I buy you a Walkman?                                                     And 						 							  Answer: Well, that depends how much it costs. What is the cost? 
                                                               Question : Well it is about 20 dollars.                                      			 					  And                                                   		  Answer : Ok, then I will buy it.

"
909,"In this example, ""radio"" is the only choice that align with ""question"" and ""yes"" as the two possible answers. ""Cassettes"" or ""cd's"" are not possible choices, as ""cassettes"", ""CD's"", and the corresponding answers are all part of ""information"".

A:
According to your explanation, I think the answer is ""Yes, this is 'question' dialogue acts"".

"
910,"In this example, inform is a better prediction than question because it indicates the dialogue acts that are characteristic for sharing facts. In this case, it's the statement that China is home to tea. This is an informational statement, not a request for an explanation.

"
911,"This is a good example of the Kreng model in action. KREG is an open source tool for automatic classification of text acts.  The model uses a combination of n-gram and machine learning techniques to classify text into one of five categories: directive/command, request, command/question, statement, and question.

"
912,"In this example, we can see that the dialogue acts of the input text are question and inform. Based on this, and the provided explanation, our model predicts that this is likely a conversation about a company that Kreng doesn't know.

"
913,"Inform is the most general dialogue action, as it indicates any communication of information. The example text does not indicate a request or a command, so inform is a good prediction. 
Overinform is an exception to the rule, where the information provided is too general. In this case, it is likely that inform was mistakenly predicted.

"
914,"This is a commissIVE text. The first person (speaker) is telling the second person what to (do) and the reason is very clear: the first speaker wants the other to follow his/her instructions. 
However, this is not the case of the example you provided. In this example, both speakers are sharing information, not giving orders.

"
915,"Question: ""have you have an Auto-reverse break"" is a direct question that is looking for an affirmative answer. 
  Inform:  ""have  you had  an Auto -reverse  break""  is an informational statement that shares information.  It is neither a request for confirmation nor a command. Commisive: the response ""yes"" would be a confirmation and a reply to the question ""Have you  had an  Auto- reverse  breaker""

A:
(over,question,directive,commissive)
question
over
direct
commissions

"
916,"This text is asking a yes/no question. The answer is no, as the tea consumption is not high compared to water consumption. 
However, it is also providing information about the popularity of tea. This indicates that it wants to confirm or agree with what the answer will be. Therefore, this is an informative dialogue Act.

"
917,"""we're trying to reduce our carbon footprint and use fossil fuel less. however, it seems that dust might have accumulated on top of the sensor. have you cleaned the vehicle often?""

This text is not a clear example of question or inform. The question is unclear as to why the driver is being asked to clean their vehicle. Additionally, there is no information being shared. Rather, this is a request for information.

"
918,"""but still i just have the latest one 2 months"" suggests the recipient of the message is not satisfied with how long the sender has had a car. 
the use ""auto -reverse"" is a slang term for ""dumb"" or ""stupid"" which indicates the author is frustrated with their car's performance.

"
919,"the predicted label for the given dialogue acts is overinform, because the provided text conveys information that is not relevant to its primary purpose (to inform). In this case, information is provided about another event that occurred, rather than the one being discussed. The taxi driver's strike is unrelated to why the car was pulledover. 
  

text: the taxi  drivers are  on strike  again. 
based on this, we can infer that there is another strike happening by taxi cab drivers. However, this is irrelevant to ""Why"" you pulled me  over? The question is about why you were pulled  Over, not about other taxi strikes.

"
920,"""how"" is the word ""howmuch"" which indicates a statement of quantity, so the question is classified here. 
the text is a simple query asking ""Why'd You Pull Me Over?"". This is an indication that it's a ""question"" as the query is for information.

"
921,"Inform is a prediction class that covers the cases when the dialogue acts are not asking a direct question or giving a directive or commissing. Inform covers all the other cases where the dialogues act conveins information to the receiver. 
  
  In this case, inform covers over predict the next dialogue action.

"
922,"Directive is the most likely dialogueact in the above text. 'Test it' is a request for action, so it is directive. Additionally, 'can you test' can also be understood as an order, where the addressee is responsible for the action. Therefore, it can only be classified directive if the receiver is also responsible. However, in that case, we would expect the sender to mention that they are going to test the product, not just 'test it'.

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue"" by H.W. Ross, there are four possible dialogue acts in any given sentence: question-answer, command-response, request- response and order-command.  
In the example you provided, ""i’m sorry"" is an answer to a direct question from the reader, i.e. ""why are you sorry?"". This is therefore a response- answer dialogue. 
""i had  a really  bad day""  is a narrative statement,  which is not a dialogue statement and therefore does  not fit into the question - answer, order - command or command - response categories.   
However, this statement could be considered a  request -  response dialogue if it were followed by ""can  you test  it out?""  This would be a directive- command dialogue, because the request is for an action to take place.

"
923,"This text shares facts about its speaker and his family. However, this does
  not constitute a request for information. The facts shared are not
asked for, nor are they promised. Rather, they are simply shared. As a
result, we classify this as a commissIVE text.

"
924,"Directive is a type of dialogue action that is used to instruct or allow someone else to perform a task or take a certain action. In this case, since the person asking permission is also the one requesting another chance, we can assume that this is an instruction or order. 
  
Out ofinform: This indicates the information provided is not relevant to the question asked. For example, if the asker is looking for the time, and you are providing the location of the clock, this would be considered out ofform. 
Question:  This indicates you should ask a direct question. If the dialogue acts is question then the next step is to determine the type. Question can be declarative or interrogative. A declaratively question is one that asks for a fact or information. An interrogatively questions is where the subject of a statement is questioned.  In this example the statement ""it has maximum Speed of 200 KM/H"" is considered a declaratives question where you would ask for information, ""what is the max speed?"". Another type is declarativo question which is when the topic of conversation is asked about. ""What is your name?"" is such a declaration.   

Inform: Inform is another type  of dialogue actions. It indicates a person is providing information to another person. Here the informer in this instance is giving information that does not require a response from the receiver. So in the example provided the answer is ""i can now watch TV"". This type does  not require an answer from another party.

"
925,"Mr. Sandsals is being asked to slowdown, so it would be a commissIVE dialogue. 
However, since the question is about commonknowledge, this is not a clear example of commissives.

"
926,"Inform is a directive dialogueact that is used when someone is attempting to direct or guide another person towards making a particular choice. In this example, it seems like the sender is offering the receiver an alternative choice, suggesting that they consider red Roses.

"
927,"the text starts with ""tell"" which indicates that it is a command, and the rest of it can also be classified in a similar way. 
""about yourself"" is an open-ended question which implies the receiver is expected to provide a narrative response. 
  This is because ""about"" implies a relationship between two entities, where the first entity is ""you"" and second entity implies something that ""I"" know about you. In this context, ""yourself"" can refer to the second party, i.e. the person asking for information.

"
928,"overinform: the prediction is too specific, i don't think the author is suggesting a course of action, but rather providing additional information. 
question: i'm not sure what the question is here. is the sender asking the receiver for their opinions? or is this a request to consider an alternative? 

 

Question: what about soups?

directive: this is a suggestion or recommendation, and the person receiving the message is expected to take action
commissive : this could be considered a promise, or a command, depending on context.

"
929,"Question is a special type dialogue acts that are used to seek information. In this case, it is clear from the context that this person has not been able to find the type position that she is looking to fill, so she has asked a simple question about it. 
Overinform is another special dialogueact that is used when a person gives too much information or details that do not contribute to solving the problem at hand. 
  In this example, there is not enough information provided to understand what type the position is, or what the requirements are for the job. Therefore, this is overinforming.

"
930,"Directive is an offer of a course of action. The candidate is being offered a job position, and they are being encouraged to accept it. 
  
Overinform is a variant of informational that provides too much information. In this example, it's likely that the candidate was given too many options, or too little information, to make a decision.

"
931,"In this example, 'are' is the question word. 'you interested' in the full-time position, as opposed to the part- time one? The answer is yes, because 'interested' can be used to express interest in something full time, while 'uninterested', can only be expressed in reference to something that is not considered as a 'full time' position.

"
932,"Directive is the most likely dialogueact for this message, as it indicates a request for a response. The message does not contain enough information to make a reliable prediction. 
  
In contrast, inform and question are the least likely, because they are used for requests for more information or clarification. In this case, there is no need for clarification, so directive is a more likely prediction than inform.

"
933,"Question: ""i can tell you about my responsibilities"" is a request for information. This is because ""tell me"" implies that the information is being offered voluntarily and without any kind of constraint or obligation. However, in this context, ""can"" could be seen as an implication that ""you can"" answer the question. If the answer is ""no"", then the request is for clarification and not for offering information voluntarily. 
  

Overinform: the prediction is correct, but the label is incorrect. In this case, it is overinform because inform is the correct label. ""Surely"" in ""of course"") is an indication that something should or must be true. Therefore, this is actually a confirmation request.


Directive: this request has the expected label of directive. A directive dialogue acts are used when someone is asking someone else to do something, to take an action, etc. Here, someone underarrest is asked to drive to London. Someone in charge is using a directive dialogue to ask someone for a task to complete.  

   commissives are only used in negative contexts. They are not appropriate for requests for action. Commissives should only be used to express negative sentiment, such as disappointment or disapproval. For example, instead of saying ""I am disappointed that you did not do as I asked"", you should say ""You are disappointing to have done so"".

 The prediction of question is not correct. Instead, a more appropriate dialogue label for this example would be directive

"
934,"In this example, ""i"" is the main speaker. ""you"" refers to the person the ""I"" speaks to, which is ""customer"". The ""consulted the"" customer and ""prepared the package"" for them. This text is considered to contain an inform dialogueact because it contains information that is being provided to a person, not a request for action.

"
935,"In the first paragraph, I read that ""he got his connections"" and that he is ""willing to give oneounce forfree"". Based on this, it seems like the person asking the question is expecting the other person to reciprocate. However, in the second paragraph we learn that this person is not able or willing do so. In this case, my prediction is that it is a request for advice or opinion.

"
936,"Over-prediction: the dialogue acts question and question are both likely given the context. 
Under- prediction: inform and query are not likely, as the conversation is not about a problem solving but about information impartation.

"
937,"Question is a type of dialogue acts that are used to seek information from the other person. The question dialogue is used when the person asking the question does NOT know the answer. In this case, a dialogue manager (such as an artificial intelligence) is called upon to provide an answer based on a set of rules. 
  
In this example, there is no answer to the query, so the dialoguemanager is asked to give an opinion. 
Opinion is another type  of dialogue Acts that is often used in a situation when someone is seeking information. An opinion dialogueact is given when a person DOES know or have an idea about the information being asked.  In that case the act would be over opinion, rather than question

A:
According to this article, ""question"" is the most common dialogue-act in English, and ""opinion"" the least common.

"
938,"In this example, ""it is free"" is information that does NOT ask any question or give any command. The customer has no obligation to purchase the item. This is an example of over-informing. 
Setting time limits on yourself is a commitment to yourself to complete a task within a certain amount of time. Setting time-limits on your communication is another way to be directive.

"
939,"This text appears to seek information and clarification from
the person answering the question about why they want or would like
to work at the company. The question mark at end of your answer
indicates that you are seeking clarification.

"
940,"Inform is the default dialogue action for any message that is providing basic information, such as the weather forecast or the time. Inform indicates the message has already been provided and is no longer needed. 
  
Question is used when the sender is looking for an opinion or evaluation in the receiver.  The receiver is expected to answer the question in order to continue the conversation.   
Directive is when a sender wants the other person to take an action. They are not asking the person for a response. 
Commissive  is used to express a wish or a request for something to happen.

"
941,"Question dialogue acts are characterized by a request for information or a clarification of information that has already been shared. In this case, there is a clear request from the sender for the receiver to confirm something. The request is not for a direct action from receiver, but rather for clarification. 
  
Out of question: the request was not clear. 
Overinform: there was too much information provided. Only a few of these are relevant to this request. For example, only the question about when the seller can begin is relevant.

"
942,"""i’m going"" is an infinitive, so it is not clear what the action is. It could be a prepositional phrase, but it could also be an adjective describing the current state. Either way, it does not fit the inform category, as it indicates a question or request. 
Similarly, ""i'd rather"" could mean either ""I would rather,"" or ""it would be better for me to,"" neither of which are dialogue acts. 
 ""cooperate with"" and ""work together"" are actions, not questions or requests.

"
943,"Directive is a dialogue acts that is used to express instructions or orders. In this case, Mike is being instructed or ordered to pack and move home, so this is an example of directive. 
Overinform is another dialogue Acts that describes the information provided is too much or too little. The information in this example is ""red cook carp"" and ""rape"", which is neither too many nor too few. 
  
Question is the only other dialogue Act that can be used in the above example. Question is typically used when the listener is expected to ask a follow up question or when more information is needed to make a decision. However, in our example, there is nothing more needed, as the instructions are clear. Therefore, this act has not been used.

"
944,"the text does provide information, but it does so by providing the time and a list of the two most common beverages after drinking water

directive (time, beverage list)
overinform (provide time), question (list of beverages), directive(list), commissIVE (make promise or give command)


In addition, this is a text about a person's health, so the dialogue acts should be commissives.

 The predicted label for this dialogue is commissitive. This is because the health information provided is about someone else's state of health and not about self, thus it is not a request for advice. Furthermore, it contains a timeframe, a specific list, of two beverages that are most commonly after the water, making it a directive. Finally, given that the person is sharing a health state, one that is likely not their own, they would be likely to be asking questions or making promises. Thus, inform is unlikely given the context. In summary, based on this piece, we can say that this information is being provided to another person, not to the self. Therefore, Commissive is most likely the correct label. 
  

"
945,"Question: the second person in a dialogue acts as a searcher, who is trying to find out more information from the other person. In this case, they are asking ""who are you?"". 
Inform:  the first person is providing information to the listener, and is acting as the seargher. 
  The second dialogue partner is giving their response.

"
946,"Inform is used in lines 1 and 2, where the author is sharing information. 
Question is only used once in this passage, in line 3, when the main character is asking for clarification. 
  Directive is also used only once, at line 4, to describe the character's request. Commissive, on its own, is never used.

"
947,"Question: ""why"" is used in the given passage. The use of "" why "" indicates the statement is being asked for a reason. In other words, it is a request for an explanation. 
Overinform: the passage does not provide enough information to make a reliable prediction. There is not enough context to determine the correct dialogue acts. 
  Question, Overinform, Question, Directive, Commissive: this is an example of using the wrong dialogueact in a given context. When using a dialogue-act incorrectly, can lead to incorrect predictions.

"
948,"In this example, 'but 4 are broke' is information, not a query. The speaker is not asking a follow-up question. They are not making a claim or asking for confirmation. Rather, they are providing factual information. 
'Can you' indicates that the question is being asked to someone who is in a position of authority (i.e. someone with the power to send people to the location mentioned). This is a directive dialogueact.

"
949,"In this example, ""yep?"" can also be consider as a confirmative response. ""Look at the new building going on?"" is likely a comment made in response of the news about the construction of new office buildings. In this case, it is a non-committal statement that does provide information. However, if the context is not clear, then it can easily be misinterpreted as question. 
  
""i will call lost & found"" is an instruction to another person. Based on this context, we can interpret it as directive.

"
950,"the text contains a request for confirmation, indicating that it was a
question;
""the traffic"" is an object, so the question is about something that can be
confirmed, i.e., something related to the road conditions; and
it is referring to a recent event, suggesting that there could be a delay.

"
951,"Out of the four possible dialogue acts, this is the only one that is directive. Directives are used to give orders or requests. In this case, it's the employee offering to drive David's international license to Shanghai, since David is visiting Shanghai and is staying in a hotel. David can accept or decline the offer.

"
952,"Inform is a good dialogue action to use when you are giving information to someone. It is used when the information is not a direct question or request. For example, you might inform someone of a change in a policy or of the weather forecast for the day. 
  
Question is another good choice when giving advice or guidance. You might ask someone a specific question such as ""Do you need a jacket?"" or ""Is it too cold outside?"". 
Directive is also a useful choice for giving orders. ""Stop"" or""Go"" are good examples of directives.

"
953,"""this"" refers to ""this House"", which could be a location, a building, an organization, etc. So the first part of the sentence,  ""This house"", could refer to either a physical location or an abstract concept. If the former, then the inform dialogue acts would be out of place, as they would not be relevant to this context. However, if the latter, i.e. ""This House"" is a concept, and the author is asking for confirmation or information on this House, these inform acts are appropriate.

"
954,"Directive is a type of dialogueact that indicates a request or instruction. In this case, it indicates the requestor is requesting the interviewee to go into the house. 
  
Question is another type dialogue-act, and it also indicates an indication of seeking clarification or additional details.  In this example, ""what else do I need to know?"" indicates there is more information that needs to be provided.

"
955,"This text does express the opinion of the author, who is a good friend of mine. I think it does look worse in here, because the temperature is getting colder and colDER, so I would recommend that you get out of there as soon as possible.

"
956,"the text does ask an open-ended question (""what would make it better?"")
there is no mention of a request for validation or confirmation from another person
""i Think"" is not an appropriate response to a declarative statement

A:
According to your explanation, I think the answer is that ""iThink"" response is used because the statement ""fresh paint  and cleaning"" does share a person's personal opinion.

"
957,"This text uses the word 'too' to convey a negative sentiment. The word is used to emphasize the negative nature of what is being said, and is not an adverb. 
  
  The text indicates the lack of availability or availability with a prepositional phrase, ""with so little windows"". This indicates a lack, rather than a positive sentiment, so the dialogue acts of question and inform are not applicable. 
It also uses a comparative form of adjectives to express a comparison between two things, with 'darker' and 'fewer'. This is a common way to compare things to show that one thing is less than another, but it does indicate a sentiment of negativity.

"
958,"Directive is a dialogueact that is used when the message is asking someone to do something. In this case, it's the person going to the exam room to examine the patient. 
  
Overinform is another term for a prediction that turns out to not be the case.  In this example, 'the kitchen' does not appear to have a large size. However, I went to check and indeed the size of kitchens varies greatly. I was therefore overinformed.

"
959,"Inform is a good dialogue action to use when you are sharing specific, detailed information, such as the weather forecast for the next few days. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive: This text contains information that is being shared, and the receiver is free to choose how to act upon it. In this example, there is no directive or commissivesent, so the inform dialogue is the best choice.

"
960,"In this example, inform is the correct classification because inform describes the type of action that is being requested. In this particular case the request is for a reservation for the hotel master bedroom suite. 
  

Hi there! I want you to know that I am reservating a room in the elegant master bed suite for my visit to San Francisco. Maybe it'll be better than the standard king size room, but I don't know for sure yet. Would you be able to give me a call when you have a spot? I'd love to book it for our stay! 
"
961,"""what are they"" is not an answer to ""how do you know that?"". ""What are They"" does  not provide any information that would answer the question ""How do You Know That?""
the sentence is in a conditional structure, indicating that there is some uncertainty about what is being asked. In this case, ""are they dogs or not?"" which is the conditional subject of a main question about dogs in general. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, it seems that you are not able to predict the correct dialogue acts for the given example. I would like to suggest you to use a tool like DialogueActParser to help you with this.

"
962,"In the beginning of the passage, we see that 'the speaker expresses his intention' to 'help' the 'listener'. Based on this, it is clear from the context that this is a directive dialogue. 
  
  The text also contains the word 'johnd' which can also be used as a first name. This implies a relationship between the two parties, and the use of's' at the end of john's name also indicates that he is the one asking the question. Based off of these two factors, along with the fact that there is no mention of a listener in the previous sentence, this becomes a very strong indication that it's a direct question from james to jonathan.

"
963,"Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that is used to express instructions or orders to a person or entity. The directive dialogue is often used in a more authoritative or commanding tone. For example, a superior might order a subordinate to complete a task. In this case, we would classify the directive as over inform because the superior is telling the subordinate what to order, rather than letting the subordinates choose for him/her. 
  
Question is another special kind of dialogical act that can be used when someone is trying to find out information. When someone asks a direct question to another person, it is natural for that person to seek for an answer by consulting their knowledge base. If the other person does not have the necessary information to provide, they will ask another for it. We would call this a query. A question is also a kind request for more information from another. An example of that would be ""why?"" or ""what?"".

"
964,"In this example, 'have' is used as a conjunction to link two independent clauses. The first clause is 'you', which refers to the person asking the question; the second clause, ""have decided"", is a dependent clause that explains the first. In this case, it is likely that 'Have' indicates a wish or desire for the answer, rather than a confirmation of a prior state of affairs.

"
965,"Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that indicate that the speaker is giving orders or instructions to the listener. In this case, it is likely that you are giving advice to your friend based on your knowledge of their interests. 
  

text: i have some great news. your tea drinking is now considered an international sport. 
based on this, you should try to increase your daily tea consumption. if you do, your chances of winning the next world cup are significantly higher.

"
966,"Directive is the most common dialogue acts in business correspondence. When a company or individual is asking another person to do something (such as buying a product, signing a contract, etc.), the request is usually accompanied by a direction (e.g., ""Please buy our product"").

In this example, ""i will recommend the wine to you"" is directive.

"
967,"Directives are used to give orders or instructions to another person. In this case, a person is being told to bring a certain item to the person who is apologizing. 
  
In contrast, informations are given to someone when they are not asked a direct question but are providing information to help someone make an informed decision. The speaker in this example is not asking the listener to do anything, they just didn’t realize they did something. This is an information.

"
968,"Inform is the most likely dialogueact for this passage, as the passage does not appear to pose any questions or seek information from the reader. The only information conveyed in the first sentence is that Mike is a person, who is introduced again in subsequent sentences. 
  
Question is unlikely, because the ingredients mentioned in this sentence are not being asked about, they rather serve as a plan for the recipe. Furthermore, there is no indication that K. is asking for assistance in following the plan. Rather, it seems that she is following along. 
Directive is also unlikely as there are no instructions given in terms of how to follow the instructions. Instead, K is simply being told what ingredients to include in a recipe, without any indication of a time limit or requirement to complete the task.

"
969,"In the example above, ""question"" is the most likely dialogue
  actuality. ""Question"" indicates the questioner is seeking information
from the addressee. In this case, it appears the person asking for help is
seeking information from someone else. Additionally, there is no
indication in the passage that ""request"" or ""order"" are possible
dialogue act outcomes. 
  
""Question"", ""inform"", and ""direct"" all indicate the
speaker is providing information, sharing knowledge, and directing the 
listener, respectively. However, these are all things the asker could do
themselves. Therefore, based on this passage, a more likely outcome is ʘʙʎ
ʔʀʏʒʷʕʰʌʇʑʈʂʉʍʅʆʋʜʣʤʦʧʨʪʫʬʭʮʯʱʳʴʵʶʹʺʻʼʿʾʽʲʸʞʝʟʠʡʢʥʖʗʛʚʓʐʃʁʄʊ�webpack.

"
970,"Directive dialogue acts are used to request or order someone to do something. In this example, gas is being ordered. 
  
Overinform dialogue Acts are similar to directives, but they provide more information than is necessary. They are often used when the request is not very complex, and the extra information does not significantly change the meaning of the message. For example:

Gas is overinform because the information provided is redundant. A person who has gas can get gasoline, too, so it does no good to tell them to get only gas. 
Question dialogue Act: This is the most common type of dialogue action, used in questions. It is used as a way to ask a follow-up question or clarify something that was said previously. This type is also used at the end of a message to express uncertainty or a lack of knowledge. Here, however, there is no question to clarify. Instead, this is a direct request for information: 

 

Inform dialogue Action: An inform action is when someone is sharing information without making any request. An example of when an action of type inform is appropriate is in a medical context, where a person is giving information to another about their symptoms.

 
  

"
971,"Inform is the most common dialogue acts in English, and it indicates someone who is providing or conveying information to another person. Inform acts are often used when someone is giving advice or information, or when a person is explaining something to someone else. 
  
Question is another common act in the English language, but it's used much less than inform. Question acts can be used to ask a follow-up question to what someone has just said, to request clarification on something,  or to introduce a new topic.

"
972,"There is a line on a pump, so the reader knows there is something to read. 
This text does contain a request for information, as the writer is expressing gratitude for being free and asking what the person is up to.

"
973,"This is an example of commissiveness, where the information provided is insufficient to make a classification. In this case, there is no indication that this is the case. The classification of 'overinform,question,directive,commissive' is therefore not warranted. Please provide additional context to help make this determination.

"
974,"Directive is a special kind of dialogue acts that are used to express instructions or orders to another person. In this case, it is used by the person asking to go on with their sentence without waiting for a reply. 
  
  The text is asking ""i'm giving you 5 more min, please continue"" which makes this a directive dialogueact.

"
975,"'you shouldn't buy your wife flowers' is a command, not a request or recommendation. 
It is not an affirmative or reassuring response.

"
976,"the text does not express gratitude or appreciation, as it does in the inform example
it does suggest a direction or action (buying weed), which indicates a commissIVE dialogue action

A:
According to this page, ""The inform and question dialogue acts are used to request information from the listener.""
So, based on your examples, it would appear that you are asking questions.

"
977,"""i want to see my mother"" is an example of a request for something that can be considered a ""wish"" or a desire. In this case, it would be a wish or desire for the child to be able to visit his mother. 
On the other hand, ""is she engagged?"" would indicate that she is engaged in some activity, such as a date or meeting. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue: A Puzzle of Words"" by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, there are five basic types of dialogue acts: 

 
Out: This is what I want. (request)
In: I like this.  (comment) 

 

Question: Is this what you want? (question) 
   
Answer: Yes, this is exactly what we want! (answer)

 
  
 
Directive: Turn off the light. Turn on channel 7. Close the door. Put the remote on top of the TV.
 

"
978,"Question: the first sentence indicates the author is enquiring about a fact, i.e. whether or no the other person is married, so the dialogue acts are question over inform (the author wants to know more about this fact), question, question and directive (tell the listener to do something), commissives (request a favour from thelistener). 
Information: after the initial enquiry, in the second sentence theauthor is requesting information from her, hence the answer is yes, she is engaged.

"
979,"In the first sentence, Johnny asks a direct question about whether or not Sandals is reaching into his pocket. 
Sandals’s response to Johnny’t tongue reaching is a command, not a suggestion or information:

Johnny: I wish y’all would stop touching me. 
  Sandials: Have a nice day.  
  John: Johnny, I’ve been reaching in my pocket for my keys. I don’ think you realize how much I hate it when you do that. Would you mind stopping? 
   Sandial: No, but I can’ t make any promises. You ’ re the one who always forgets to bring them.

"
980,"This text contains a request for information, so the dialogue acts out of question and inform are used. The request is for the mother to confirm that her son's arm length is indeed longer than his. 
However, this is followed by a response that is more of a complaint, where the inform is replaced by overinform. In this case, it is likely that this was a mistake by the classifier, as the response is not really seeking confirmation, nor is it asking for confirmation. It is instead a more complaint-like response.

"
981,"the text implies a request for a ""wake up"" call, making it directive
without revealing which dialogueact the prediction was made for, you cannot explain that it was a particular type of directive - you can only explain it as a general trend

text: ""tomorrow i'll need you to wake me up at 6 am""
based on this context, I predict a direct request, because tomorrow is the future tense, indicating a requirement in the near future, so the request is for tomorrow's action, waking up the listener at a specific time in tomorrow.

"
982,"Question: This text invites the receiver to share their personal weakness. 
  
  Overinform: the question is too general and does little to narrow down the scope of the discussion. The receiver could have shared any weakness, not just a personal one, making it overinform. 
Not question: this is a statement of fact, it does no invite the addressee to give an opinion or provide a recommendation.

"
983,"In the first example, ""i"" is instructING ""you"" to give ""me"" two phone calls. 
""i hit s nooZE button so giv me 2 calls""

This text indicates the speakers are directing someone else to perform an action.

"
984,"Directive is a dialogueact that asks a direct question or makes a request. The predicted label for this dialogue acts is question. 
In this example, 'it will be their pleasure.' can also be classified under question because the question mark is used. However, it is more likely to be an affirmative statement expressing the speakers' agreement with what the other person said.

"
985,"the text uses the word ""will"" instead of 'will you', which indicates a request or a wish for the listener to respond 'Yes' or 'Of course'
""change the call"" implies a change in the dialogue context, and a commissivo dialogue acts when a person is asked to change something in their behavior or attitude. 
  

A:
According to the NLT text you provided, there are two possible dialogue Acts: question and directive. 
Question: ""they"" want ""the government"" to ""reduce the"" price ""of the gas""
Directive: why'd ""you"" pull ""me"" over? ""yes"" we ""have"" one ""copy"" left.""
In your answer, you can mention that ""They want to know why you pulled meover?"".

"
986,"In this example, ""no rather said"" is an adverb that modifies the verb ""said"", which means ""to speak"". Therefore, it can be used to emphasize or qualify the meaning of what was just said. In this case, since the speaker was surprised that their request had been completed so quickly, they said ""rather said"", to convey their surprise. 
  

A:
According to Dialogue Act Labeler, this is the correct answer: question

"
987,"In the example provided, there is no indication that either the person speaking or the listener is making any requests of the other. The information is simply shared between the two parties. Therefore, based on this information and the context of its delivery, we predict that this is an instance of sharing rather then asking, commanding, promising, etc.

"
988,"Because the dialogue acts of the given example text are inform and commissIVE, it is classified under the latter. 
  
  The text is asking a direct question: ""Have you got any weed?"". However, there is no indication that this question was asked in a commanding or directive manner. Rather, this is a request for advice, and the answer is provided in the form of a confirmation:  ""yes you have"". This is an example of commissives providing information in an answer to another question or statement.

"
989,"This text is clearly asking a follow-up question to what the person has just said. ""Have you ever seen..."" is an open-ended question that invites the listener to supply a response. 
""Have [you] ever..."" indicates a request for information, as the ""you"" is followed by a possessive pronoun. 
  ""Ever"" can also be used as an adjective to describe something that has existed for an extended period of time. In this case, it is used to indicate that ""have [ you] seen"" has a long duration.

"
990,"Out ofinform: the information provided is not specific enough to not be classified elsewhere, for example, as a request for information
Question: does the dialogue acts classification make sense? If not, please explain
Directive: instructs someone else to perform an action
Commissive : makes a commitment or promise

A:
According to your explanation, this is an example of a dialogue where the inform is a better choice than the other options.

"
991,"In this example, 'in a flutter' is used to describe someone who is flustered. This is an idiom that means 'to become excited or agitated'. The speaker in this case is expressing excitement or agitation because they are nervous about an upcoming interview and are 'fluttering' from nervousness. 
  
'Your throat' and 'all the symptom of flu' are used as examples of the physical effects of an influenza infection. These are not questions, but rather are statements of fact.

"
992,"In the first example, ""i mostly eat baking chicken"" is a fact that is shared without seeking confirmation or a guarantee of truth. The recipient is free to choose to confirm or deny this statement, and the inform dialogue action is appropriate. 
  
However, in the second example the statement ""there's no fat"" appears as a recommendation or suggestion rather than a factual statement. As a result, this is classified under the over category, as the question mark indicates the likely intent of both the asker and answerer.

"
993,"Overinform: i'm not sure if this is a statement or a request for information. The speaker does ask for confirmation or information but does so in a way that does NOT require a response. 
Question: the first sentence contains a direct question 'Of course I do.', which indicates the question is for clarification or further explanation. 
  The second sentence does contain a declarative statement 'i am in need', which could be a declaration of fact. However, it could also be an expression of need or desire. In this case, 'I'm such an' is an adverb, modifying the verb 'need', and therefore it should be treated as an element of speech rather than a clause. If it were a sentence, then it would be either a main clause or an embedded clause, neither of which it qualifies as.  
Directive: although the sentence is not asking a follow-up question it does include the word 'then'. This indicates a directive command. 'Then' can be used as a conjunction to link two independent clauses, but it can also function as the imperative mood of 'tell then'. 
 Commissive (also known as command): the last sentence could function either as  a request or as direction. Since it includes the words 'you', 'do',  and 'it', it seems to be asking someone to do something.

"
994,"Inform is a less assertive form of communication than question or directive. It is used to share information or share knowledge. The inform form is often used in a more casual or friendly setting, whereas the question and directive forms are typically used when someone is being questioned or when a commitment is made.

"
995,"Question: Yes, I think your brief case is large enough. 
Inform: I'm not sure, please check and let me know. 
  Question : Do you mean my bag or my case? 
   Informed: Your bag. Please check.

"
996,"Overinform: the prediction contains too many possible answers, making it difficult to determine the correct dialogueact. 
Question: some of the answers in the above list could be a request, command or question from another person. However, this is hard to tell from this list alone. 
  Directive: this answer could indicate that one person is giving instructions or directions to another.  
 commissIVE: it is possible that this could represent a conversation between two people, where one is making promises or giving recommendations.

"
997,"Inform is the default dialogueact in most cases. However, in this case, inform does not fit the context of seeking information. The person asking the question is actually seeking assistance, so a request for assistance is more appropriate. 
Request is another appropriate dialogueakt for this context.

"
998,"Directive is a special kind of command used in negotiations to set the terms of an agreement. In this case, it is being used to negotiate the supplies that will be provided to the employee. 
Question is another kind  of command that is used when a speaker is trying to get information from a listener. The speaker wants the listener to confirm or deny something. For example, ""Do you believe that?"" or ""Are you sure?"". 
  In this example the speaker, employee, is attempting to obtain confirmation that a notebook is available for purchase.  
Out ofinform is when the information provided is not relevant to what the person is saying. ""I don't believe you"" or  ""I'm not sure"" are examples of out ofform.   
Commissive means that someone is making a request or giving an order. Here the order is to leave the notebook behind.

"
999,"Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are similar, but inform is more specific and specific to the topic of the driver's license. 
Question: is looking for clarification. 
  The text is unclear, so the question is raised to seek clarification from the other party.  
Directive: command. the police officer was asking the passenger for permission to search the car.

"
1000,"Directive is the most common dialogue-act prediction in this example. 
Out ofinform: the sender is telling the receiver what time it needs to wake up. Question: does the person know about oolong and compressed tea? Commissive: if not, then the message should be conveyed to the receivers.

"
1001,"In this example, ""where are you going?"" is a statement, not a
question. However, in some contexts, a person may ask another person a direct question by using the word ""why"" in the statement. For example: ""Why are we going to the store?"" or ""I don’t understand why you’re mad at me."" In this case, we classify the question as being in question form.

"
1002,"the text ""yes."" is used as a reply to the greeting ""good
afternoon!"". ""Yes."" indicates affirmative consent to what the
speaker has just said, and is therefore an example of answer
speech. 
  
""I want"" is an instruction, so the dialogue acts of ""I
want"" are commissives.

"
1003,"In this example, 'you are in a different direction' is an explanation of a fact, not a query. Therefore, this is a non-question dialogue response. 
  
'You are heading in another direction.' is also a factual statement, so this would be an example of over-informing. However, in this case, since the statement is followed by a clarification, we classify this as a dialogue question: ""you're going the WRONG DIRECTION. Are you sure you want to go that way?""

"
1004,"In this case, it seems that there is an element of uncertainty in what the questioner should do. It is not clear from the dialogue context whether the asker is expecting an immediate answer, or is simply seeking clarification, so the classification of question is applied.

"
1005,"Inform is a prediction based on a pattern of words or punctuation in a text. In this example, based upon the punctuations and the use of ""you"" in the second half of sentence, it seems like the author is suggesting that you go to a nearby bus station and get a transfer to another bus. 
  
Question is another prediction from a word or a punctuational pattern in text that indicates the asker is expecting a response from another person or an entity.  In this instance, there is no other person mentioned in this sentence and so the question marks indicates that this is an open ended question that is waiting for a reply. 
Directive is the prediction of a dialogue acts based off of how the sentence is constructed. The sentence starts with a verb and then a prepositional phrase that acts as the object of that verb. This structure indicates a command or suggestion.   
Commissive indicates an act that occurs in between two or more people or entities. Here the two people mentioned are the addressee and sender of text and it appears that they are communicating with each other.

"
1006,"""Surely"" could be seen as a confirmation of what the previous statement said, so the inform act might have been predicted. 
Alternatively, ""Surelys"" might mean ""I'm sure of it"", so it could also be classified under question as the second interpretation is a request for confirmation.

"
1007,"Inform is the most general dialogueact, indicating that neither a request for a response nor a warning is being given. 
Question is used when a statement is asked for confirmation. For example, ""are you sure?""
Directive is when one is giving orders. ""Do this!""
Commissive indicates when someone is expressing their feelings or emotions. They might be expressing sadness or anger. 
  ""I'm sad that my car broke down.""

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue: A Puzzle of Words"" by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, there are five basic types of dialogue acts:  inform, question, ʻdirectʼ, ′commissiveʾ,  and irelative.  
ʺDirectʹ is an act that is not asking a questions, giving a commands, making a promises, expressing feelings, etc. ʲCommisive,ʞ is another way of saying that someone else is showing their emotions, such as sadness, anger, fear, joy, excitement, surprise, confusion, among others.

"
1008,"Directive dialogue acts are used to express a person or organization's wishes, orders, instructions, and suggestions to another person. They are often accompanied by a verb such as'say,' 'tell,' or'request.' 
  
In this example,'shall we...?' is a direct question. 'Surely,' the answer to the question 'Shall we?' can only be 'yes,' which the addressee can confirm or deny. Therefore, this is considered a 'question' dialogueact. 
   
Overinform, give a suggestion, tell a story, ask a clarification, make a recommendation, offer an opinion, provide an example are all examples of directive dialogueacts.

"
1009,"the text does ask for a response (i hate saturdays)
it is not a request for information, but a directive to choose between two options (go shopping or not)

"
1010,"Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to express orders to another person. In this case, KARA is ordering Mike to not mind Sunday being the day of the week as long as Saturday is not changed. 
  
In contrast to inform and question which are more general dialogue Acts, directives are less common and are often used in more formal situations.

"
1011,"'over' indicates that there is a higher probability of the dialogue acts being commissIVE or DIRECTIVE than question or inform. 
'the most Important thing' is not a complete sentence, so it cannot be used to determine the classification of a dialogueact.

"
1012,"""i will"" is a command, not a statement. 
the ""the man"" and "" the seas"" are ambiguous, so it is not possible to determine if the man is referring to a person or a body of water. 
  In this case, it seems that ""man"" refers to person, but it could also refer to body or body part of person.  
In the context of the sentence, ""a man will come"" implies a future event, therefore it can be inferred that person ""will"" refer either to the person who will arrive at the specified time or to another person (the person to whom the first person will speak). 	Either way, person is clearly not referring either the body (sea) or the bodies (man). 
	In addition, in the next sentence the author is talking about a book. Therefore, I think it's safe to assume that book ""The man  and the Sea"" does exist and it refers either a physical book or an idea of book that exists in someone's mind.


I think the command ""i  will go"" can refer only to physical action, because the action is performed by the same person that is speaking. In this context, we can assume person refers both to ""person"" (first person pronoun) and to an object (verb).

	Therefore, based on this sentence and context it appears that in this example the inform dialogue acts are question and directive. The question dialogue is about information: ""do  you have a man or sea?"". And the directive is related to action:  ""go the  day after tomarrow"".

"
1013,"""the given"" indicates the information contained in the previous sentence is not the complete message. 
the ""kind of"" stores indicates there could be multiple options and the choice of options depends on additional information. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue: A Puzzle of Words"" by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, there are five basic types of dialogue acts: question; directive; inform; request; and command.  The text you provided falls into the inform and request categories.

"
1014,"Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the most appropriate. The information provided is about something that is generally true, so it does not require a response. 
Question is used when the information being provided requires further clarification. In this case, we need to know more about whether the speaker is making an offer or asking for permission. 
  Directive is appropriate when a person or entity is expected to take an action. Here, a travel request is being made, requiring a decision from the other party. Commissive, on its own, is rarely used. However, when combined with another act, such as question or offer, Commissives can indicate a stronger request or command. For example, if the question is ""are we going to war?"", then the offer command ""we are not going into war"" is more likely to be considered a command than a mere question/request.

"
1015,"This text contains a polite request to a person for their assistance. Based on this, we can predict that they will be asked for name. 
Also, this is the first time the writer is asking the recipient to go with him to another place to purchase a gift. It is likely that this person will not be comfortable with this request, and will likely try to discourage the request. 
  This is also why the directive dialogue acts are the most likely.

"
1016,"the text provides information without seeking an answer (question)
it is providing an offer or proposal (proposal) without being directive or commissives

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue for Dummies"" by William Zinsser, a good rule of thumb is that if the question is expected to be answered, then the answer is an inquiry.  If the statement is intended to offer advice or guidance, that is considered a recommendation.

"
1017,"""yes, I was just confirming that for sure"" is an example of over-prediction, as it is also a example for question and commissIVE. 
On the other hand, ""I was providing a confirmation"" fits the inform dialogue category.

"
1018,"This text uses the word ""this"" to refer to a building, so it can be inferred that this is the questioner's reference. 
""What"" is used as a way to ask for clarification, indicating that ""how"" or ""why"" are not appropriate responses.

"
1019,"the text provided information to the listener about names for different types of weed
this information does NOT ask any questions, make any directives, nor commit the individual to anything

A:
According to this article, there are four possible dialogue acts for any given paragraph: question/inform, request for information/opinion, command/request, complaint.  The text in question is clearly a request, so the dialogue is probably question-inform.

"
1020,"This text asks a clarifying question about someone's name. 
  The name of that person has not been mentioned in the previous text.

"
1021,"In the first sentence, ""yes,"" the author states a fact. In the second sentence the ""author"" states another fact, namely that ""the towel"" was ""named after it's designer, gustav eifel."" This is an example of ""over-informing"" the reader, as the statement in the previous sentence is redundant. 
""yes"" is a modal verb, meaning that it can be used as a ""question"" or ""statement of fact."" In this case, however, its use as ""a question"" would be redundant, since the question is already answered in ""it was designed by gustaf eilf.""

A:
According to your text the following dialogue acts are possible: 

 
inform: ""i think you should charge me 6 dollars""
question:  ""why 6?""
directive:   ""charge the customer what we agreed on"" 

 

indicate why the above dialogue is possible

"
1022,"Question: the dialogue acts of 'trans pacifc airline' are overinform,
  question, direct, commissive. The first two are indicating that more
information is needed to classify the act correctly. Commissivity indicates
that the answer to the question is 'yes', so the classification is correct. 
  However, since the first part of the sentence indicates the opposite, i.e. that'more information is not needed', the second part is also needed, and the correct classification becomes question over inform question direct question commisive

"
1023,"Directive is the most general type of dialogue acts. It is used to express instructions or orders to another person. In this case, it is likely that you are asking the person you’re speaking to to change their reservation. 
  
Overinform is another general term for a directive act. The person receiving the directive is not sure whether to follow the order or not, so they overinform by providing more information than strictly necessary. For example, they might say “yes, i’ll change it”, when they actually meant “no, don’t change anything, keep the current reservation”. 
   
Question is one of the possible types of predicted dialogues act in this example. Based on your text and the surrounding context, there are two possibilities: either the sender is unsure about something and wants to confirm it, e.g. “trans pacifc flight” or the receiver is trying to find information, in which case the question mark is added to make the message more interesting.

"
1024,"Question is a dialogueact that is used to ask a direct question to a person. In this example, it seems like the person is asking for the name of who is speaking. 
  
  In contrast, inform is the most general dialogueAct and can be used for any kind of information. So in this context, this could be considered an informational text.

"
1025,"In this example, ""so"" is used to ask an explanatory question: ""So, why you speeding?"". This is because ""Why"" can also be used as a form of interrogation, to seek an answer to a why question (""Why did he do that?""). In addition, when used in this way, it can function as the interrogatives ""Whys"" or ""Wheres,"" to indicate a place or location.

"
1026,"Directive is the most general dialogueact, and it can be used for any kind of interaction. It is used when the conversation is expected to move in a specific direction, without the need for further information from either party. For example, a salesperson might ask a customer for their order number, but the customer does not need to provide this information in order to complete the sale. In this case, direct is an appropriate dialogue tag for this interaction, as the information needed to proceed is implied by the context. 
  
Question is another general conversation act, used to seek information. When a person asks a direct question they are expecting an answer, so the question is considered a form of dialogue. However, when a directive act occurs without an implied answer or request, it should be considered as commissIVE. Commissive acts are used in situations where a request for action is not expected, such as when someone is giving directions.

"
1027,"This text uses the first and last names of both the sender and the receiver, indicating that it is a form of communication between two individuals. The use of first names is considered to be a sign of closeness between the individuals, so the use here is likely to indicate that both parties are familiar with each other. 
  
Additionally, this is the second text in a series of three that use first-name communication. In the previous text (first name j-u-d-y), the dialogue acts were classified over inform because the information provided was not sufficient to determine the correct act, but in this one the inform act was the most likely. Based on this pattern, it can be concluded that this particular text used firstnamecommunication in an effort to establish a closer relationship between sender (j-ud-yg) and receiver (wyn).

"
1028,"Inform is a non-committal, neutral dialogue-act, while the other four are either directive or commissives.

"
1029,"the text does ask for a decision, by suggesting where to pay the bill. 
this is the first time we see the word 'where' in the given context, and it typically indicates a location or an address. The use of'where'in this context indicates the question is about a place where one should pay, rather than a request for assistance or payment.

"
1030,"based on this passage, it is possible that the dialogue acts in this example are question and commissIVE. 
the text asks a new question about a flight cancellation, and the response is to inform the passenger of their new flight details. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think the following are the possible dialogue Acts in the passage: 

 
Question: ""i Think it's A Distance of  180 Kilometers From Here To London, So It Should Be A Two - Hour Drive On The Motorway.""
Inform:  ""The Distance Is 180 Kilometer""
Directive:   ""So It  Should Be  A Two- Hour  Drive On  The MotorWay"" 

 

 commissives: Overinform, Question, Directive, Commissive

"
1031,"Inform is used to describe a conversation where one person is giving information to another. In this case, it is the man telling the boy to go to the doctor and confirm the diagnosis. 
  
Question is a way to seek clarification. It is possible that in the previous conversation the boys asked the guy for help and the question here is seeking clarification of what exactly the help is for.  

"
1032,"the text does ask for information, but it does so indirectly by asking Mr Sandal for advice on a personal matter. This is an example of a commissIVE dialogueact, asking a person for help in a non-directive way. 
Mr Sandel is not the one seeking advice, it’s Michelle. So the dialogue acts are not interchangeable.

"
1033,"In this example, it appears that there is an attempt to gain information, since the question is seeking to determine whether the person has heard about two types or teabags. However, there are also actions indicating that this is more of a directive dialogue, in that it seems the speakers is guiding and directing people through a process, such as asking the individual to ""open his/her mouth"" and ""say ah"".

"
1034,"Question is the most likely dialogueact in this case, since the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates a request for further information. However, inform and question are not mutually exclusive, so it is possible that this is an example of question arising from a statement that is intended to be informational.

"
1035,"In this example, it can be seen that ""good - by"" is over-informative and therefore classified commissively. The speaker could have simply said ""all set"" or ""bye"" instead. 
Another example of over information is ""i ’m all - set."" This is also classified Commissively because it could be interpreted as the listener being asked to do something.

"
1036,"This text is asking a questions, specifically about high speed travel. 
  The text does provide information, however, it does so in the form of a statement, not a direct question. Therefore, this is a supply act.

"
1037,"In the beginning of your message, you provided information to the receiver about an item that you saw. Based on this information, we were able to predict the dialogue acts in the following text. In the second part of our analysis, a dialogueact was classified out of question and question. We were not able, however, to explain the reason for this classification.

"
1038,"Directives are requests for information or actions. The speaker in this example is requesting that Rachel provide company-specific letterheads, ball-point pens and envelopes, so that she can fulfill her order. 
  
Questions are seeking explanations or strategies. Based on this sentence, it is not clear why Rachel needs the specific items she needs. Therefore, this is a query, not a request for direction.

"
1039,"Question is the dialogueact that is most similar to inform in this context. Both question and inform are statements that provide information to the recipient, but whereas question is used to seek clarification, information is provided in an attempt to stimulate a response in inform statements. In addition, inform is often used in a negative context, whereas questions are asked in order to obtain information for a positive outcome. 
  
In this example, ""what’s your Extension?"" is considered a  question because the question mark indicates that there is uncertainty about a fact, and the statement is therefore used for the purpose of seeking clarification. Furthermore, extension is an important concept in computer science, so it makes sense that someone would ask for an extension in the context of computer programming.

"
1040,"'charles Brown' is not a name, but a title. The person is therefore not being asked for their name. However, it can also be considered a request for information, since it seeks to know something specific about someone. 
  
In this case, 'anything else' can mean'anything you would like me to add'. This is a statement of request, because it asks for something from another person.

"
1041,"'yes' is an affirmative answer to the question of whether the listener should recognize the person being asked. 
'trust me' indicates the trustworthiness of the answer, so it's classified here as a trust question
'surely' makes the statement more certain, and it also indicates a lack or uncertainty in the information provided, making it classified in this case as 'question'
'more' asks for more information, indicating that the provided information is not sufficient and a follow-up question is needed.

"
1042,"'well - build' is the only aspect of the dialogue acts that is similar. Based on this, it is likely that this is an aspect that was inferred from context. For example, if the reader were to see this passage in a book, they may assume that 'well built' refers to physical strength. In this case, 'light blond' hair would be a trait that would not be expected from a person of 'Well built'.

A:
According to this article, there are 4 types of dialogue Acts: 
1. Commissivo: This is used when you want someone to do something.  For example: ""I want you to go to that party.""                                                               2. Directivo : This type is when someone wants you do do an action.  For Example: “I need you help me find the car keys.”                                                                        3. Questionario: When someone is curious about something, for example “What time is it?”                                            4. Indirecto:  This is for when the other person is affected by what you say.  For Example : “You look tired.”
In your example the first two types are not applicable, because the person asking wants someone else to perform an act, so the commissivo is out of scope. However, since the third and fourth types apply, you can use the questionario and indirecto.

"
1043,"Question is the most likely dialogueact, given that this is an inquiry from a third party seeking information. 
Directive is another likely prediction, since the request for assistance is being taken care of. 
"
1044,"the text does not ask a specific question. It simply provides the information that a person's appearance may vary based on their ethnicity. 
it is a confirmation of something the previous statement mentioned. 
  The text ""well it is true, he has such a complex mustach, I have a picture of him with a goatee, so I think he must be a latino""

A:
Your first text: ""i tried my hardest to only eat fruits vegetables and chickens"" is an example of directive.  This is because you are giving instructions.   
""I tried to do my very best""  
In your second text you ask ""it depends what the cost is"" which could be interpreted as a request for clarification or an open ended question that you can answer with ""It depends, what do you think?"".

"
1045,"This text contains a direct question about the age of the recipient. This is an indication that this is the first time the two parties have met and the questioner is interested in the answer to this question to determine if the relationship is going to be a good fit. 
  
If the response is ""30,"" then the dialogue is over and this relationship does not work out. If the  response is less than 30, then this person may be open to the idea of dating this individual and may even be interested.

"
1046,"Inform is a generic dialogue category that can be used to describe any type of information-giving act, including statements, questions, directives, and commissives. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive: This text is an example of an inform text. Mike is giving KARA information, so the dialogue acts out of which to classify this are inform and question. The predicted label for this instance of Mike giving information to another person is 'he's in-his-late-thirties.' 
   
Overinform: In this case, inform is not a suitable classification for the act that Mike was performing, as it does not provide enough information for KAR to make an assessment of his age. This is because the statement that 'Mike is thirty-three years old' is more specific and provides more information than the generic inform classification.

"
1047,"the text does not provide any information to help the reader determine the time of arrival of the flight, so it is not an out of time question. 
it is an interrogative question with a question mark, indicating that it contains an uncertainty. 
  
  Based  on the context, it seems like the person asking is asking when the other person will know the arrival time.  This is another characteristic  of a questioning question

text: ""what time"" does ""his flight"" arrive?
based on this context it appears that ""he"" is referring to the photographer, and the ""flight"" he refers to is "" his"" flight. So the question is about the arriving time for "" he""'s flight
so the expected dialogue acts are question and question followed by a period.

"
1048,"""i am sorry"" and ""look, here is the amount of money that you were charged for twice"" are both examples of apologetic behavior, indicating that this person feels bad about what they said or did, and is seeking understanding from the listener. 
This person appears confused about why they were being asked about their situation. They may be seeking information from someone they are speaking to, but are not sure who they should be speaking with. Or, they may not understand how their actions impacted the people around them. Either way, this is an example of someone who is confused and seeking clarification. 
  
  ""that sounds good,"" on its own, is not an act, it's a statement of opinion. It does not indicate a desire for clarification or an attempt to share information.

"
1049,"Question: the use ""what"" in the sentence ""how much will it cost?"" indicates a request for information. 
Overinform: ""will it be expensive?"" is not a complete question and does  not provide enough information for an answer. The question mark indicates uncertainty, not clarity. 
  Question mark:  ""will what it will cost?,"" indicates an uncertainty about the cost of the item.  
  Inform:   ""what will you get?"" provides enough context for another person to provide an appropriate answer, without requiring further clarification.

"
1050,"In this example, ""great"" is the response to a request for information. The response indicates that the speaker is happy with the outcome of their request, and is suggesting a follow-up action. 
  
""We can Chat while Enjoying a Cup There"" indicates the plan of two participants for a conversation. While this is not a direct order, this suggests that a commissivo response is appropriate.

"
1051,"In the given context, it seems like the question is being posed to the person who is offering the food.  The person offering food is asking ""would like"" which indicates the offer of food was made with the expectation of being accepted. 
  
If the dialogue acts of both the persons involved in the conversation were classified correctly, this would be a conversation between friends. In this case, both persons would likely be classified with a commissives dialogueact.

"
1052,"Inform is used when the message is providing general information without requiring a response. For example, a salesperson might inform a customer about a new product, while not requiring the customer to buy the product in order to receive the benefit of the sales person's knowledge. 
  
Question is when a message requires a follow-up response to provide more information or clarify a point. A sales representative might ask a clarifying question after providing a general sales pitch, such as ""What size is the bed you'd like?"" 
   
Directive is reserved for messages that require an immediate action by an agent. An example of a command message might be ""Call Joe on extension 5555"". 
    
Commissive indicates a conversation is over and the agent should continue on to another task.

"
1053,"Question: ""no thankyou"" indicates the question is about the process of giving or receiving information. 
Overinform: the phrase 'thankyou' indicates a preference for something, so the inform act would be classified instead. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, it seems that you are right.  The text would qualify as a ""question"" dialogue action.

"
1054,"In this example, ""have a soda"" is a request for something. The
speaker is directing the receiver to go and get a drink for herself. 
  
However, if the same text was classified according to your approach, as
inform (inform, out ofinform questiondirectivecommissive), then the
dialogue act would have been commissIVE. This is because commissives are
used to request something from the addressee, and in this case the request
is from another person.

"
1055,"In this example, soda is an item that can either be chosen from or offered to a person. The question mark indicates a desire for more information from the speaker. This is because it's not clear from this sentence whether the soda will be offered or chosen. 
  
If the sentence was changed to:

'Would you prefer a cola or a lemon-lime?' 
   
the question would no longer be a direct request, but rather a comparison question that is still asking a guiding question of a choice.

"
1056,"the text asks for a Sprite, indicating a wish or desire to receive something
""i want a sprit""

or
based on this context, ""please send a sprite"" is a directive request, because the request is for someone else to carry out an action on behalf of a recipient
someone else, like a server or courier, to bring something to the location of text
this is because ""someone"" knows that ""it does"", which means that it's possible for ""someone"" to send ""a sprITE"" (a sprite is an animated character from the game ""coco"")
note that this is not a recommendation to engage in any illegal activity, nor is it a guarantee that such activity will be carried out
it is merely an observation that someone, somewhere, sometime, may have the ability to execute this action
hopefully this will provide some insight into the workings of sprites in ""Coco"" and the context in which they appear in this film

"
1057," commissives are used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision, and the person being addressed needs more information to decide. For example, a boss might ask a subordinate for their opinion on a matter, but does not want to hear a response until they have all the facts. 
  
overinform, inform and question are the other two possible choices for this dialogueact.

"
1058,"This text contains a command or instruction for another person to do something. 
It also indicates a reason or purpose for this command. 
  The speaker wants the person who is speaking to bring a snack with them when they go to the snack machine.

"
1059,"Question is one of five possible dialogue acts. Question can indicate that someone is making a suggestion or request. In this case, it's likely the person is offering you a tea tasting. 
In contrast, inform is used when someone wants to share information. ""Do you have any idea how many calories are in that chocolate bar?"". 
  In this example, ""Inform"" is not the right dialogueact, because the information is negative. It's not helpful to tell someone that they have too many bad calories in their diet. Instead, they should be trying to reduce their bad calorie intake.

"
1060,"Inform is a prediction that is based on a combination of words, punctuation, tone of voice, context, etc. In this case, based off of ""open your mouths"", ""say 'aha'"", and ""How much are they?"" the system is able to predict that this will be a directive dialogue. 
  
Question is predicted based only on words and punctuations. It is not based upon any other factors. Based off the ""What is this?"" and the response ""it's an exam"" the question ""what is an exa"" is answered. However, this is classified under question because it is only based of word choice and not upon other context.

"
1061,"Insurance is the background of the sender, so the directive act should be used. 
However, this is not a request for more information. Rather, based on this context, insurance is something the receiver has experience with, making it overinformative. 
  

A:
According to the model, your answer is: 

 

I'm afraid I don't have any personal weakness.

"
1062,"In the example provided, ""please accept [our] sincere apology[s], i will be happy to switch it[ for a different one] if [you] wish"" is an example of a directive dialogueact. The speaker, in this case the addressee, has offered a suggestion or a proposal and is asking the listener, here the writer of my answer, to agree to it. 
  
However, if the reader of your answer were to guess the dialogue-act label, they would be most likely to predict question because of ""nONSMOKING"" and the fact that ""queEN-SIZE BED"" doesnot appear in the sentence.

"
1063,"Question dialogue acts are used to seek information from the listener. The question dialogueact is used in this example because it seeks to understand why the person answering the question is asking the questions they are. In this case, it seems the insurance company is curious as to why someone would want a career in insurance. 
  
Overinform dialogueacts are not used often, but when used, they indicate that a person is being overly verbose or is trying to give too much information. Here, overinform indicates the use of question rather than directive or commissives in the dialogue.  The insurance companies response indicates it was trying too hard to provide too many details, and instead should have used a commissIVE dialogue to make its point. 
question: Why do I want be a insurance  agent? 

 

Directive dialogue Acts are often used when the main purpose of speaking is making an order or taking action. Directives are also used for giving instructions to someone else. When used correctly, directives can be very powerful tools for making someone do what you need them to. For example, if you were to ask someone why they should do a particular thing, a direct question would be: ""why should I do this?"". A directive would then be ""do this or else"". In the example provided, ""they request the govenment to  reduce the gas price"" is a good example of giving a direction to another person. By using the word ""request"" in that context, you can tell that this is an example where the direction is meant to influence the action of another.

"
1064,"In the above text the use ""i know"" indicates the author has knowledge or experience in this area. 
  

A:
According to the GPT-3 model, this is an example of a text that is over-informative.  The model predicts that this person cares about insurance, and that they know how important insurance is. However, there is not a direct statement that indicates this author is actually knowledgeable in insurance matters.

"
1065,"Question is an interrogative word or phrase that is used to seek information, typically from a person. In this case, it's asking about work experiences in promotions. The word inform is not used in this context, because it would be used before question in a conversation. Instead, inform uses question to introduce a new topic or ask for clarification. 

In addition, this is the first time the writer is introducing the topic of work in the context of promotions, so it may be a first-time question for the reader.

"
1066,"'yes' is an affirmative statement, and it indicates the certainty of its antecedent. Based on this, it is classified under the predict affirmative class. 
  
  'i have' indicates a past action. Therefore, this is also classified in the past tense class, over the other four classes.

"
1067,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask for information, clarification, confirmation, etc. The question dialogueact is used in the following example: 
Person A: ""Did you enjoy your meal?""

In this example, person A is asking person B for a reply. Person B could have replied with a confirmative statement like ""yes"" or a negative statement such as ""no, I did not enjoy my meal"". Person A would then have used a follow-up question to get more information from personB.  Person B's reply of "" yes"" would be classified a Question dialogue Act. 
 
However, if personA had asked a direct question such ""are you enjoying your meals?"", person would have received a response that does  not align with question. Instead, a directive dialogueAct such as ""I am"" or ""you are"" could be received.

 

"
1068,"Yes is a common response to questions, but in this case, it's being used in response a statement rather a a direct question. The statement is also acknowledging the situation, and is expressing regret. In this context, Yes is an appropriate response.

"
1069,"Inform is a dialogue-act label that indicates a person has provided information to another person. The inform label is used when a recipient of the information is expected to confirm or deny the accuracy of that information (e.g., ""are you sure that this is okay?""). 
  
Question is another dialogue action label used to indicate that a request for confirmation or denial of something has occurred. 
   
Directive is an action-label that is typically used in a conversation to request a change in another's behavior. Directive can also be used as a way to express a command or order. In this case, ""do it!"" is directive.

"
1070,"This text contains information that is being provided to the reader, but also seeks information in return. The information being given is about the person speaking to you, so it is an ""out"" dialogueact. However, since the information is also being sought, this is classified under ""over"" inform. 
  
  The text includes a request for personal information, asking ""what [are] your [personal] weaknesses?"". Personal information should only be given in response to a direct question. Therefore, ""question"" is a better classification for this dialogue acts.

"
1071,"Directives are used when someone is giving information to another person, and the recipient needs to take action based on that information. In this example, if the first person were to say ""sir, would you mind if i sit next to thewindow?"" the second person would need to respond ""yes, that would be great!"". 
  
Questions are asked by the listener to seek information from the asker. If the questioner were asked ""would ya like ta sit by th window?"" they would have to answer ""yeah, it's a great view!""
Statements are made to make promises or give commands. ""I'm so sorry sir, what seem to you tobe the problem?"" is an example of a statement that is not a directive but is instead commissIVE.

"
1072,"inform is the most common dialogue acts in this context. The person providing information is trying to share it with the listener. 
question is used when the information being provided is a request for clarification, and it is not clear from the context whether the request is understood. 
  

Question: ""well it's depends of of what?""
Inform: to clarify the question
Directive: tell
Committive : do this
Request: explain to me what the cost is
Command: give me the details
Statement: I will pay $10
Clarification: well it would depend on what, if the item is expensive.

"
1073,"Directive is the most general dialogue acts, and can be used for any kind of request. In this case, it is used to request information from a person at a nearby table. 
Overinform is another general term for predicted labels that are not part of any dialogueact category. 
  In this example, inform is overinform, because inform was the highest predicted label.

"
1074,"In the beginning of your text the asker says 'let me...', which can also be considered a request for permission. 
Then the menu has not been mentioned before, so it can't be classified under the directive dialogue acts. However, it is a clear request to let the person who is speaking to see the manu. 
  The text continues with 'oh.they haven’t got a menu either.' which could be seen as an explanation of why the people at the restaurant do not have a'menu'. 
   This text can therefore be categorized as inform.

"
1075,"In this example, 'are going' can be considered an adverb, and therefore the question mark is added to the beginning of the sentence to make it an interrogative sentence. The sentence is then classified into the interrogatives category because it contains a yes/no question and requires an affirmative or negative response.

"
1076,"Question dialogue acts are used to seek information from the other person. In this case, it appears that the asker is seeking information regarding the cost of the meal. 
Overinform dialogue Acts are a type where a person gives too much information, and therefore is considered to be over-helping the listener. Here, too many details about publicspeaking are being shared, making it difficult for this askerto understand what is being asked. 
  

 commissives are for making promises or commitments.  In this instance, there is no promise or commitment being made. Rather, this is an impromptu comment made in the middle of an ongoing conversation.

"
1077,"Inform is a more general dialogue category that includes questions and requests for information. The question mark in the beginning of the message indicates this, as does the lack of any indication of who is sending the request. In addition, there is no indication that this is an instruction or offer. Therefore, inform is more appropriate than question. 
  
Question is another general category of dialogue acts. However, in this case, it seems more likely that it refers to a request for an evaluation from a person.

"
1078,"Inform is not applicable because this is a conversation about the price of something, not a recommendation or request for a price. 
Question is also not appropriate because there is no request or command in the provided text. 
  Directive is the most appropriate predicted act because it is an instruction or order to someone else. Commisive acts are requests for information, which this does contain. However, this request is for more information and not for the person to change their mind.

"
1079,"This text shares information that is specific to the receiver (the hotel room cost). It is not asking a direct question or giving a direction, so it likely falls into the inform category. 
On the other hand, it does contain a request for a discount, and normally the question would fall into command or request. However, in this case, since the discount has already been included, this falls under the overinform category, as the request is for more information than is normally included in a dialogue.

"
1080,"Directive is used when the message is not to take action, but instead to convey a request, order, suggestion, etc. 
Overinform is the opposite of directive. It is to provide too many details or information, which can make the recipient feel overloaded or overwhelmed. 
  Inform is often used to describe a situation in which the sender is seeking information from the receiver. Question is another type of dialogue action that can occur when seeking clarification. Commisitive is when two or more people are working together to accomplish a goal.

"
1081,"This text contains a request for information. The speaker wants the person he is talking to to provide specific details. This is a commissIVE dialogue. 
  
However, this request is also a way to try and get the other person to do something, by threatening to not provide information if the request isn't met. So this could also be classified a command.

"
1082,"Traveler’s Checks is a payment method that is not mentioned in the passage. Therefore, it is classified here as a directive act. 
  

A directive dialogue acts are used when the information imparted is important but not essential to the main purpose of conversation. For example, a salesperson might say, “We’re having a party on Saturday night, and you’ll definitely want to come. The guest of honor is coming, as well as several other high-level executives from the company. We’d love for you to attend.” In this example the party is the important information, not the guest or executives.

"
1083,"This text can be interpreted as the host asking the guest to leave, and the response is ""ok, I'll leave"". However, this is not the case. The guest is welcome, they are welcome not to take money in exchange for their services, so the reply should be ""yes, please do"".

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Stalnaker, there are four basic types of acts: question; directive; inform; and commissives.  The text you provided is clearly a commissIVE.

"
1084,"Inform: the information is about offering help to the other person. 
Question:  the question is asked by the person offering the help. 
  Directive: it requires the response of another person to accept the offered help or not. Commissive : it could be a general conversation about what to do in a situation like this.

"
1085,"Question is the second predicted act in the above text. Based on this, it can be inferred that this is an informational text and not a command or request text as the first predicted action is command (directive, command, request, commis). 
  

Command: This text contains the word'reserve' which can only be used in a sentence if it is part of a verb. In this context, 'Reserve a Hotel Room' is actually a Verb. 
    
Verb: A verb is used to express an intent to do something. 'Want to Reserve A Hotel room' indicates the desire to make a reservation.

    Question:  The text 'Could you provide your name?' is asking the question.  This indicates a need for information.   
    Inform:   The information the asker is looking for is their full names. This is why the act has classified it as a Question.    

  Directive: In the given context of 'want to Reserve A hotel Room', the command is out of place. It should be placed before the verb 'to Reserve'.  

 Commissive

"
1086,"In this example, it is not clear whether or how the printer is to function. The recipient of information may need to provide further instructions in order to use the device.

"
1087,"Directive is the most extreme form of communication. It is used to impose a command or order on another person, typically without any prior communication or agreement. 
  
  The text uses the word ""first"" to emphasize that this is an order, rather than a request. Additionally, turning the light on requires the physical action of turning a switch, indicating a physical requirement that must be met before the order can take effect. In contrast, information is typically conveyed via speech without requiring any action on behalf of either party. Thus, this use and order of ""turning the switch"" indicates a directive communication act.

"
1088,"In the given context, it seems that the author is trying to convince the reader that she is happy with her current lifestyle. The author does mention that it 'is noproblem' for her to be able to afford to go on trips frequently. However, she does so by providing only generalities and not providing any evidence to support her claim. 
  
Also, in this context the word 'traveling' is ambiguous. Does the 'it ’s no trouble for you to  travel frequently' refer to the travel itself or the frequency at which the individual travels? If the latter, then the statement is not necessarily true.

"
1089,"This text was instruct or suggest an act to someone, and it was classified under the question dialogue acts. 
Or this was an inquiry or request for clarification, classified in the inform dialogue.

"
1090,"Question: ""Do you still have some paper?""
Overinform: I'm afraid not. There's not much left. 
Overturn: Sorry, I didn't realize you were running out. I'll have to wait until we get to a store to get more paper then. 
  

A:
According to this article, there are four types of dialogue acts:  question, inform(ation), directive and commissives.   The inform action is the most common, appearing in about half of all utterances.

"
1091," commissives are used to express strong opinions or commands, and they are often used in negative contexts to indicate that something should be done immediately without being asked
the text 'i'll be right back', when interpreted in the context of a conversation, can indicate a request for someone to do something immediately, without first being questioned or assured. In this case, however, this is interpreted by the model as expressing strong negative sentiment, indicating that someone should not be interrupted while doing something important.

"
1092,"'Please help' is a request for assistance. The speaker wants the listener to do something for them, typically to help them with a specific task. This is typically a social interaction and not a communication between two individuals. 
However, in this case, there is not enough information provided to determine the appropriate dialogueact. We do not know if the request is for help with the washing machine or the dryers. Therefore the dialogue acts directive and commissIVE are predicted.

"
1093,"the text does ask for more information. 
it is a directive text. 
  The text asks the person to do something.

"
1094,"This text provides information about how hot potatoes are typically handled. The speaker isn't asking another person a direct question or giving a direction, so the dialogue acts of 'over' are not applicable.

"
1095,"Inform (30%)
Question (40%) 
Directive (10%) 
  
Commissive  (10%): 
   

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible answers to a ""are busy"" question:  ""yes"", ""no"",  ""I'm not sure"", or ""I don't know"".   If the answer is ""yes"" or  “I’m not  sure”, the question is informational.  If  the answer to “are  you busy” is “no” or “I  don’t know”, then the  question is directive. If the person is busy, then it is commissives.

"
1096,"In this example, I didn’t know I needed to change my clothes. I thought I was just going to be out for a walk.

"
1097,"In this example, 'the dryers costs $1' is overinformative, because the prices of both items are mentioned. If the price of a dry-er was mentioned, it would be more informative to say 'The dry er costs fifty cents.' 
  
However, if the washers and dryeners are both mentioned in the same text and are not priced differently, then the inform is appropriate. 
"
1098,"Question is the most likely dialogueact given the context of the sentence. The sentence begins with ""i was wonder..."", indicating that something is being wondered at. Then, ""fun the night..."" is followed by ""at the..."" which indicates the event is a movie. Finally, after ""the..."" the next word is ""friday,"" indicating the date of another visit. All of these factors indicate that a ""what"" is occurring, namely, that someone is wondering what was had at a previous visit to the movie theater. 
However, there is also a suggestion of ""want to do..."" at ""k""ara. ""Want to..."" can be used to express a desire to act or do something. In this case, it is likely being used in a sense of wanting to visit the same movie theatre again. 
  

In summary, this is an example of question-asking followed immediately by asking-of-a-plan.

"
1099,"In the given context, there are two people involved, a speaker and a listener. The speaker instructs the other person to do something, in this case, push a slot into a machine that will then turn it on (which is the action that needs to happen). 
  
This text is an example of a text that is informative. It provides the necessary information to enable the reader to understand the context and act accordingly.

"
1100,"Question dialogue acts are used to probe for information from the other person, to seek clarification,  or to request an action from them. In this case, 'is everything you have me to  do?' appears as a query, seeking confirmation of the information provided in 'yes.'. 
  

A:
According to this page, you can use the predict_dialogue_act function to get the prediction. 
In your case: 

 
from nltk.corpus import newspeak
import nlp
nlp.load('newspeak')
text = 'We're Sorry That This Has Happened, And I Guarantee That The Same Mistake Won't Happen Again.' 
    print(nlpr.predict_ DialogueAct(text))
Out[1]: urn:news:speech:0x7f9c0e8b8e20
    Out:   We’re Sorry that  this has  happened, and  I guarantee  that the  same mistake  wont happen  again.

"
1101,"Inform is a dialogueact that is used for sharing information. The provided text does share information, namely there exist green, white and black tea varieties. However, it does so in a way that does ask additional questions, gives commands, makes commitments, etc. Therefore, inform is not the correct dialogueAct to classify this instance of text.

"
1102,"inform is characterized by sharing information or facts, such as providing the requested information about when the hotel room needs to be ready. 
question is another type of dialogue acts, characterized asking questions, e.g. ""who are you?"". In this case, inform is not applicable, because the question is being posed by this specific person. 
  
directive is an instruction to do something, like putting your hand behind the head, or giving roses as an expression of love. This type is appropriate in this context, since the Sandal's employee is ordering Mr Sandels to act in a certain way.

"
1103,"This text indicates the need for flowers to be bought for the wife, and therefore it can be classified a direct instruction or order for someone or something to do something.

"
1104,"In this case, 'question' is the correct classification.

"
1105,"This text contains a direct question that is seeking an answer from its recipient. 
It is likely that this question is rhetorically posed, since it begins with the phrase ""werent you"" which suggests that its asker is questioning something that they think should already be known. 
  Additionally, it discusses a topic that many people would know, traffic signals.

"
1106,"Inform (30%)
Question (10%) 
Directive (20%) 
   commissIVE (50%)

"
1107,"This text suggests the possibility of the need for more information from its speaker. This is an indication that it is more of an ask than a tell.

"
1108,"This text provides information to the receiver about a company's policy, indicating that it is trying to influence the choice of the other party. 
Over: Overly directive or commissives in my opinion.

"
1109,"Question: ""what if"" questions are used to clarify details or expectations. In this case, it's asking what would happen if the sick leave days ran out before December 31st. The question is therefore a clarifying question that helps the receiver understand the information provided. 
Inform: if you use your sick time before year end, your pay will be adjusted accordingly. 
  Directive: you should use sick day before end year to avoid penalties.

"
1110,"the text is considered to have a higher probability of being question than directive. The question mark at the end of the first sentence indicates that the information provided is not conclusive and could be a statement or question. Therefore, it is classified here as question

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue for Dummies"", the following are the possible dialogue acts for a given text: 
1. Commendative: This is a polite way to start a conversation.  The person you're talking to is doing something good or is in a good mood.  2. Directive:  This is an order or request.  3. Question:  This question is for clarification. 4. Commissive : This means to make a promise or commitment. 5. Request: You are being asked to do something.

"
1111,"Inform is a neutral dialogueact, meaning it can be used in either a request or response. In this case, it’s being used as a response to a previous question. The speaker wants to know if the other person would prefer to smoke or not. If the answer is no, then the inform dialogue acts are overinform and question; if yes, than the dialogue is commissively followed.

"
1112,"This text is asking for information, but it is not a direct question. Instead, it provides background information that helps the reader understand the context of the conversation. For example, 'famished' is a strong word to use to describe someone who is actually not familliar with that word. 
  
Also, this is an example of over-classification. While the dialogue acts are not question-asking, inform-directive, etc., the classification is still based on a combination of features, such as the use of strong words, word order, punctuation, intonation, tone of voice, length of text.

"
1113,"In this example, we can see that although the first part of the message is written in a way that could be interpreted as question or command (the use of ""sure.""), the second part is a statement of assurance, so the overall dialogue is classified inform.

"
1114,"In this example, it appears that ""where"" is being used as a verb, rather than a noun or adjective. This is an indication that this is likely a ""question"" being posed to the person answering. 
  
""Where"" can be used to ask a person a general question or to request a detailed answer. In this case, given the context, I believe it's likely being interpreted as the latter.

"
1115,"Directive dialogue acts are characterized by the direction of the conversation, rather than a request for information or a suggestion. They are not seeking to obtain information from the other person, nor are they making promises or commitments. 
In this case, it appears that we are being given a direct order or request from our waiter. We should go the the Cafeterium.

"
1116,"""i never got any food"" is the only instance of ""informativeness"" in the entire text. This is an example of how the inform dialogue acts are used to describe a person sharing information. 
  
  The text does not contain any directives, promises, questions, evaluations, requests, orders, suggestions, pleas, etc. Therefore, it can be classified under the over category.

"
1117,"Inform is used when someone is sharing information, or when they are giving information to someone. In this example, it seems like ""the food"" is being shared, so this is an instance ofinform. 
Question is when a person is trying to get information from someone, and is receiving a response. So in the example above, ""can you take me there?"" could be aquestion. 
  However, if the person being asked is also trying get instructions from the same person, then it would be commissiveso.

"
1118,"This text seems to seek information from another person, so it could be a direct question or an indirect question: ""Can I have the menu?"" or ""Do you have a menu? I would like to see the options.""
It could also be an inquiry, in which case the question mark would be added after the ""What?"":  ""What do you mean? Do you or don't you?""
Finally, this could have been a command, but the use ""can"" instead of must or should indicates it's a directive.

"
1119,"the text does not fit into the categories of question or directive. The question marks at both ends of the sentence indicate that there is more information to be provided, and the use of ""anything"" in the last part of that sentence indicates that this is not a directive message. 
  
  The text could be considered commissIVE, but it does fit better into an inform category. A commissived message is one that requires a response from its recipient, whereas aninformative message does NOT require a reply from it's recipient and is instead an announcement or notification.

"
1120,"In the given context, i was considering getting Chinese food, but the author of my response was not in favor of that. They expressed that Chinese cuisine is not something that they are interested in. This indicates the presence of a directive dialogueact.

"
1121,"Inform is a dialogueact that indicates that the dialogue acts out of the other four. In this case, inform is used because there is information in the previous text that is not being shared. The first text states that they bought chows me in which is an action. However, they did not share the taste of it. Based on this, it is classified under inform.

"
1122,"In this example, we can see that the given statement is an evaluative or factual piece about the performance of someone. The speaker states that someone didn’t do well on a particular task, and therefore the statement can be classified under the factual dialogue category.

"
1123,"Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive: the statement shares personal preferences about food, which is aninform dialogueact. 
Overinform: it provides more information than is necessary, and therefore is overinform. 
  

I think the meal there is really good.

"
1124,"the text asks a direct question: ""do you agree to the terms of our agreement?"". 
it gives a directive instruction: ""... please sign the agreement."". 
  
However, this is not the case of ""agree to our terms"". Rather, ""agrees to terms"" is a more natural construction.

"
1125,"Inform acts are used to provide information to the other person without asking for it. Inform dialogue acts can be used in a variety of situations, such as when a person is giving information on a topic they are knowledgeable about, when someone is sharing a piece of news, and when an employee is informing a manager about something that happened at work. 
  
Overinform acts include asking too many questions, making promises, providing instructions and making statements that are not true.

"
1126,"inform is used to provide information about a fact or a state of affairs, without offering an opinion or making a claim. 
question is the second most common dialogueact in this context. it's used when a speaker wants to know something from a hearer. the hearers response will influence the next action of he speaker. if the response is negative, speaker will take a different action. but if it’s positive, then speaker doesn't change the action, but just waits for the other person's response. in the example, if ""they"" are not mentioned, it means the service is not available. so the speaker is just asking for information. 
 question is also used in a negative way. for example ""are you sure?"". this means ""you should do this or that, because it will be better for both of you"". in other words, ""it's better if you do it this way"". 
 directive is another common category in human-human communication. when one person has some authority or power over another, this person will usually give orders to another person. In this case, since the person who is giving the order is an AI model, we can say that this model has the power to give instructions. So the use ""Let's Go!"" is in directive.

"
1127,"In this example, it is clear that 15 min is not enough time for the two of you to review the material. The doctor is clearly frustrated by the lack of preparation and the patient is being uncooperative.

"
1128,"In this example, we can see that the dialogue acts inform and question are most closely related to the provided text. The inform act describes the situation in which the sender is grateful and the question act indicates a request for information. Based on this information, it is clear that this is a text that is asking for a response. Therefore, I would recommend using the command dialogue  act in response to this message.

"
1129,"the text starts with why, indicating that it is an inquiry;
based on this structure and content, we predict that this is a directive dialogue; 
overinform, direct, command, and commissively ask the question why.

"
1130," commissives are used when the information being shared is of high value and needs to be treated with care. For example, if a person is being asked to keep a secret, they should be commissed to do so. If someone is giving information to another person, it should also be Commissed that person will take action based on this information. 
  
Out of Commissive:

over Commissives: 
- when sharing low value information, such as the time of day or weather conditions, Commissing is unnecessary
  - if the shared information is low-value, then the dialogue acts of the conversation should not be Commissive
 - if someone asks you a direct question and you do not answer, that is considered over Commissiveness.

"
1131,"In this example, ""we'd"" is the subject of the sentence, so the verb ""like"" should be in third person present tense. However, since ""want"" was used as the action verb, it was in present progressive tense, as in ""I want to read the clause about the wooden case.""

A:
According to the book ""Text to Speech for Dummies"" by John Krause, there are four types of dialogue acts: 
1. Commendative: This is used when you are asking someone for something
2. Directive:  This is when someone is telling you what to do
3. Commissive : This describes when a person is making an agreement or a request
4. Informative :  When someone shares information

"
1132,"Mike is telling KARA that they should do what he wants. 
  Mike: ""they"" want ""the government"" to ""reduce the
  price of"" the ""gasoline."" 
 Mike is asking KARA to take action.

"
1133,"This text is considered to be a request for permission to do something. The speaker, ""you know"", is asking for the permission of the addressee, who is the producer of a set equipment, to ship partial equipment.

"
1134,"Inform is used when the information is shared to a specific person, and is therefore not intended to share information broadly. For example, ""I understand that position"" is informational, because it's meant for a particular person (the recipient) to understand. 
  
Question is only used in negative contexts, when a statement is being questioned. ""i don't understand"" would be a questioning statement. However, in this case, inform is more appropriate, since the statement itself is providing specific, non-broad information to someone.

"
1135,"Directive is the most general dialogueact, and is used when the speaker is trying to get the listener to do something. In this case, i want you to tell me the color of the suit you want me to purchase. 
  
In this example, 'the color' is a physical object, so the directive dialogue acts are the physical action of asking the questioner for a color.

"
1136,"Question dialogue acts are characterized by asking someone a direct question. In this example, ""double breasting"" is a term used to describe the clothing worn by men when they attend a formal event. ""Double breast"" refers to two pieces of clothing, a jacket and a shirt, that are worn together. A man would wear a single-breasted suit if he was attending the event, but would double- breast if they were wearing a tuxedo. 
  
In this context, doublebreasted refers specifically to a man who is wearing tUXedo and double BREASTED, as in a double breasted jacket. This man is asking if the wearer of that clothing wants to wear it double or just single. If the man was simply providing advice or information about clothing choices, he would not ask the question ""do you double?"". Instead, if that were his intent, it would be more likely that he'd provide a link to an online style guide or provide an image of different clothing options.


A:

This is an example of question dialogue.  The speaker wants the listener to answer a yes/no question: do the person want a Double Breasted Suit or a Single Breast Suit?  This could be because they want the suit to be double, because double is the preferred style, etc. 
Note that this is just one possible interpretation of what the dialogue is about. There are many possible answers to this question and the answer the author chose is completely up to him. He could have chosen another answer if it was not clear to them. 

"
1137,"Single breasting is an established fashion, so it's likely that the speaker is providing confirmation or information to the listener. 
  
  Out of question: the statement'single breast' is neither a request nor a statement. Rather, this is simply a fact. 
Out Of inform: single-breasted suits are a fashion trend, and the person providing this information may not be aware of that fact, but is instead providing a confirmation.  

"
1138,"This text contains a request for a specific item. The request is for the item to be done, so it can classify as a command. 
  
However, this is the first time the request has appeared in the conversation. As such, we cannot determine the order in which the commands were given. We can only assume that it was given after the greeting, ""how are you?"". Based on this assumption, and the fact that this request was for an item that was not mentioned before, that would be a suit, a type of clothing, then we can assume the following:

It was a conditional command, given before the response was provided. 
If the person responded ""I'm fine, thank you,"" then the command would have been fulfilled.

"
1139,"This is an example of a text that is not aligned with any of the dialogue acts. The predicted label is either question or directive.

"
1140,"Inform is a polite dialogueact that is used when someone is providing information to another person. In this case, ""you are right"" and ""we will able travel high speed at beginning of journey"" are both pieces of  information. Therefore, this is an example of an inform text. 
  
Question is another polite dialog act that can used to ask questions. Based on ""i’m sorry sir, what seem to you the problem?"" the speaker seems concerned about what the response might indicate. This is therefore a  question.  However, it does  not fit the inform category as it also contains a request for a response. 
Directive is also another dialogue action that  can be used in this context. ""what seems the  trouble?"" is the question is asked by the second person to a direct question from the first person, and the answer is sought. However, in the context of "" you are  right, we  will be  able travel  high speeds  at beginning  and end  of journey"", the directive is not appropriate as the two statements are not asking the same question and therefore do not fit this category.   
Commissive  is another  dialogue act  that can  be used  when someone  makes a promise or commitment. Here,  the statement "" we shall be   able to  travel  High speeds""  could be considered a committment.

"
1141,"Inform is a polite way of asking a question. It is used when the questioner wants to make sure the other person is aware of something, or is just curious. Inform can also be used to express interest or as an introductory statement. 
  
Question is the first of four possible dialogue acts. When used as the initial statement of an inquiry, it indicates a need for clarification. As the second statement, when used in a request-response dialogue,  it indicates an explicit desire for something to happen.  As the third statement in an invitation to action, such as ""Would you like to have lunch?"" it is an expression of willingness to take action or a suggestion for action to be taken. Finally, in the fourth statement as part of expressing regret, asking ""Why did you say that?"" when you did not mean to.

"
1142,"Directives are typically offered by someone who is in a position of authority (such as a manager or parent) and are meant to be followed without question or further explanation. In this case, Diane is the person in authority and is therefore directing the response from her.

"
1143,"Inform is a non-verbal conversation act that conveys information to another person without committing to any action. Inform acts can also be used to request information from another. 
  
Question is another nonverBAL conversation ACT that seeks to find out information by asking questions. 
Directive is an action conversationACT that is used when one person takes an initiative to do something. For example, a person may ask another to pass them the ball, tell someone to pick up the phone, and so on. Commissive conversation acts are used by one individual to ask for or commit help from someone else.

"
1144,"Directive is a directive dialogue acts that are used to communicate a request for a specific action to another person. In this case, it is asking for the customer's suggestion. 
Overinform is an overinform dialogue Acts that is used when a person gives information that causes another to feel overwhelmed or confused.  In this example, customer service agent is giving too much information, causing the agent to over-explain. 
  Question is another question dialogue Act that indicates a desire for clarification. Here, we can see that customer is confused about whether to accept the offer. He is looking for clarity on whether or not to take the suggestion from customer care.

"
1145,"Directive is the dialogueact that is most likely given the context of your question and the preceding text. Directives are used by people to tell someone else what to do, and are considered to have a negative connotation. In this case, it appears that ""we think"" is being told what the model thinks, rather than telling the customer what they should think. 
  
Out of direct, questions are often used when someone is requesting information, so the use here of directive is likely to indicate that someone was seeking confirmation of something the listener was already aware of.

"
1146,"Inform is used when the information provided is understood by the recipient. In this case, we understand the content of the message, but it is unclear to us. We are not asking a question or giving an order. 
Question is when someone is trying to get information from you, and you are asking them a direct question. 
  In this example, I am asking you if it will be possible to take 689 hours in 6 weeks.  
Directive is  used when you want someone to do something. For example: You can allow another person to speak if they are presenting information that is important to the discussion. You could also ask someone for their opinion.   
Commissive  is used to request someone's help. Someone could be requesting your help if: They are explaining something that they do not understand. They need your assistance to complete an action. Or they want your opinion on an important topic.

"
1147,"In this example, ""let me help"" is an offer of assistance, so the dialogue acts directive and commissIVE are most appropriate. However, this is not a direct question or statement of fact, but rather a command. 
  
""young man"" and ""worry"" are subjective words, making the question of whether or not the person is ""young"" or ""worried"" irrelevant to whether the statement is directed at the individual or to a larger group. This is another reason why the directive dialogueact is most applicable.

"
1148,"directive is the most negative classification for a dialogueact, and indicates a strong requirement or order. 
overinform is also a negative label, indicating that this act was too informative. Informative acts are used when the sender is providing information to a recipient. 
  
question is another negative dialogue label. Question acts seek information and require an  answer from another person, making it similar to directive. However, a direct question will seek an immediate answer, while a directive question may require some time to answer (e.g. a suggestion). 
 question acts can also be used to seek clarification, but this is not the primary use of question in this context.

"
1149,"Directive dialogue acts are used to request a response or action. The
  speaker is asking the listener for a specific response. For example,
""Please call the store and tell them to ship the order out tomorrow.""

In this case, someone has a request to do something, namely, pick the
boss up at airport, but the request is not for the person picking the 
  bOSS up, i.e. the addressee. Rather, this request belongs to someone else, 
   which is the company that is hiring the employee. So the directive dialogue
   act is used.

"
1150,"In the given context, ""what to do"" indicates the need for the person to know the details of a car that is not theirs. Therefore it can be categorized under question dialogue acts. 
  
""i do not know"" falls into the same category as ""do you know this person?"". The latter indicates a lack in knowledge between the two parties, and the former indicates uncertainty about a fact that may be known to the listener.

"
1151,"This text contains a direct question. The question mark at the end of the sentence ""do you know me?"" indicates that the preceding statement (""yes"") is an answer to a previous question (""do I know who you are?""). 
  
However, this is not an informative statement. Rather, it conveys a fact, namely that ""yes"" is the answer of a yes/no question about whether the person asking knows the other person. 
   
In addition, although the statement ""I don’t know"" can technically be classified under the question dialogue category, in this case it does so only because of its position immediately following the word ""know"". The statement does  not contain a clear question or request for information. Instead, ""don’ts"" are a common feature of ""no"" statements.

"
1152,"This text contains a recognition of knowledge or expertise on someone’s part. 
It is not a request for confirmation, a demand, nor a threat. 
  Therefore, it is classified under inform rather than question.

"
1153,"Mr. Stevenson is the author of 'the fish thatn't' and'moby dick as a work of fiction'. He is also a professor at university of california berkeley. He has written several books and essays on literature and film. The author is a strong advocate of literary analysis and critical thinking. 
  
In the above text the question mark at beginning of each line indicates the start of question marks. 
'are' is an interrogative word. 'you' refers to the reader. Mr. Stevensen is not a person, he is author. So 'Mr.' is used instead of using 'You'. 

 

A:

This is actually a very good question!
I think the answer is that it's a direct question because the writer is looking for a confirmation or an agreement from their addressee.  The writer wants to make sure that their assumption is correct, and they are looking to their address for confirmation.

"
1154,"""yes"" is a response to a yes/no question. ""yes,"" as a reply to ""are you michael j. o'neill?"" is an affirmative answer. However, ""you're Michael J. O'Neil,"" is neither a confirmation nor an denial. Rather, it's a greeting. 
Similarly, in the context of a request for information, a ""no, I'm not Michael O’Neil"" would be a denial, while a “yes” would indicate a lack of interest.

"
1155,"overinform: the prediction contains too much information, it does contain some information but it is too many. 
question: there is some content in the sentence that could be a query. However, there are also some commands or requests in this sentence. 
  directive: this is an action-oriented sentence, so the dialogue acts classification is overinform. But the action is not a simple command or request. Commissive is also a possibility. In this case, we should consider the meaning of the following sentence: ""The young men are not allowed to leave the room until they have completed the examination."" Commissives are used when the main action of one person is dependent on another person's action. So in our example, if the person who is going to examine the throat of young people is the one who gives the order, then the command is commissives. If the examinee is allowed not leave until he completes the process, that is, until the examiner finishes the exam, he is being commissed.  

A:
According to your explanation, I think the correct classification of dialogue Acts in that text is: 

 
Overinform - the content of prediction (i.e. the entire sentence) is very detailed and contains a lot of information. For example:  ""well now I want change date 24 to the 28"". 

 

Question - there's some part of sentence which could potentially be considered as a ""question"" but there also exists some other parts which are commands/requests. An example of such a sentence is ""well what do you want me to do?"".

 
  
 
Directive - this type dialogue Act is used to express instructions or commands. Here the ""I"" is expressing a wish or desire to alter the given sentence from ""24"" to ""28"".

 
   
   
 

"
1156,"This text is providing a simple response that offers information. It does not seek further detail, give instructions or make commitments. 
  
Yes, I have a general understanding of the topic.

"
1157,"Directive dialogue acts are used to request or order someone to do something, and are considered to be more authoritative than other types of dialogue Acts. For example, 'Would you please pass the salt?' is a request for a person to pass a salt to another person. 'Please pass me thesalt.' is an order for the second person (the recipient) to hand the first person a specific item. 
  
In this example 'would you' is used as a polite form of asking, while 'please pass' and 'pass me' are more directive. In this case, since the recipient is not asked to take any action, it is classified under directive rather than commissives.

"
1158,"Question dialogue acts are characterized by seeking information from the other person, asking questions, and making promises or commitments. In this case, 'will befine' is a statement of fact, not a request for information. Therefore, it is classified here. 
Inform dialogue Acts are classified elsewhere in this lesson. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue for Dummies"" by William Zinsser, there are four types of dialogue: question/answer, request/reply, order/direction, command.  The text you provided is in the question and reply type.

"
1159,"Out ofinform: the information shared is not relevant to the task at hand, so it does not belong in this conversation. 
Question: there is a direct request in here for someone to send a person to someone else's location. However, there's no clear indication of who is requesting this, or why. It could be a mistake, a misunderstanding, etc. 
  Question is the most common dialogue acts, it indicates the asker is confused or uncertain about something, they want to confirm something or ask for advice. In this case, we do not know who the question is directed to, nor why they are asking this question
Directive: this is an instruction or a command, usually used when the request is for a recipient (person, animal, object) to perform an action, to carry out a certain task. The sender wants the action to happen, not just wants someone sent, this indicates there might be something wrong with the way the person is supposed to go to this person's destination, someone should be there to help them.  
Commissive (sometimes called'request'): this act indicates someone is making a polite request, asking for something from another person, without requiring an answer or an immediate action from them, just to let them know that someone noticed they need something and is asking. For example, you might ask a friend to pass a message to another friend, when you don't want them to see the message right now.

"
1160,"Question: This text is asking a follow-up question to the statement'so do I.'. The question is 'will you still call [me] if [I] don’t pass [my exam]?'. 
  
  In this case, it is considered a commissitive act because the question asks for a future action from the listener.

"
1161,"This text uses the word 'you' to refer to the person who is answering the question rather than the actual questioner. 
Although the sentence ""it means you were unsuccessful"" is grammatically correct, this is likely an attempt to discourage the asker from waiting two more weeks before they try again.

"
1162,"Question: the question marks at the end of each sentence indicate that the information provided is incomplete and invites the other person to provide more. 
In this case, ""ok"" is followed by a request for further information. 
  
Directive: ""please wait"" can also be interpreted as a command. The person who is speaking is requesting the person being spoken to to do something. In this specific case the command is for the interlocutor to pause and wait.

"
1163,"In this context, 'discuss' is an action that is typically associated with a commissIVE dialogueact. The speaker indicates this by using the modal verb'must' in the sentence 'i must discuss the matter with...'. This implies a requirement or obligation, typically expressed through the use of the verb must. In this example, it is the interviewer who is requiring the candidate to make this decision. 
However, this is not the only context in which the word'discuss'is used in this way. For example:

'I will discuss my options with my parents.' (This is a typical way to say that you will inform your parents of your decision.)
'the discuss topic with your friends.'  (This implies you are going to have a discussion about a topic, rather than making a decision or taking action.) 

 

A:

 The predicted label for this dialogue is commissives because the context is ""I mustdiscuss the matters with others""

"
1164,"Out ofinform: the conversation is not relevant to the current situation
Question: there is a need for the answer to be asked
Directive: a person should do something
Commissive : a conversation should not end here

A:
According to your explanation, it seems that your prediction is correct. The conversation in the above text does ask for an explanation.

"
1165,"In the given context, it is unclear whether the person asking for a copy of the pictures is asking a general question about copies or is making an explicit request. If the latter, then the question is likely a commissIVE, not a direct one.

"
1166,"Inform: the dialogue acts are providing information to a listener, without asking a direct question or giving an order. 
Overinform: similar to inform but the information is too much. 
  For example, ""it will rain tomorrow"" or ""you should not eat that"". 
 Question:  the dialogue Acts are asking direct questions or making commitments. For example ""is it true that it will be raining tomorrow?"" or 'you must not have eaten that, you will get sick'. 
 Directive: a directive dialogue Act is used when a person is requesting or commanding something from another person. An example of a request for direction is ""could we go to that restaurant?"". A command is when someone is issuing an instruction, such as ""put the phone on redial"".
Commissive : similar as a commissivo act, but it is also used in requests for help or assistance. This is typically used by someone who is inexperienced or in need of help. Example: ""can you help me find the remote?""

"
1167,"Inform is a non-directive dialogueact, as it does seek information. However, in this case, it is not being provided to the listener, but rather being offered to another party. 
  
Question is another non directive act, however, this act would be used when asking someone else for information or advice. In this example, there is no question being asked, and the information is being shared.  

"
1168,"Inform is a non-question dialogueact, as it is used to request information. 
Question is the next most likely dialogueAct, followed by directive and commissIVE.

"
1169,"Directive dialogue acts are used to request something from the other person. In this case, they want the listener to let them look over the bill. 
Overinform dialogue Acts are similar to directives, except that they provide too much information. For example, if the person asking for the document is a child, then it would be overinformative to give them the entire document. A better response would include a few key lines that summarize the main points of the information, without providing too many details. 
  
Question dialogue Act is used when someone is asking you a direct question. The question dialogue is over when the question is too general or open-ended. An example of a general question would ask ""why is it so hot outside?"" An open ended question could be ""what is your favorite color?"".  A commissives is when you are making an offer or commitment, for example ""i will give you this book for free if you pass this exam"". 
    
Inform dialogueAct is typically used in response to another person's question or statement. This dialogueact is also used as the starting point for a conversation. When someone asks you something, your first response should be to inform them of what you know. If you don't know the answer, inform the asker of your best guess. You can also use this dialogue to gather information from others.

"
1170," commissives are often used when someone is making a suggestion or offering advice. In this case, it seems like the person is suggesting that they should start exercising more to improve their health.

"
1171,"Question: I think I have a very kind personality. I am very helpful, friendly, honest, loyal, hard-working, humble, empathetic, patient, creative, curious, optimistic, etc. 
  

In this case, I would classify the question as being over inform or question. Inform is the correct classification for the dialogue acts of the following text:
'wOW! That's fast!! I don't think We will travel that Fast on Motorway'
and 
'tdon’t worry young Man. Let me Give You An Examination. First let Me take A look At Your Throat. Open Your Mouth and Say Ah'

"
1172,"In this case, inform is a better prediction than question because it indicates a desire to share information, rather that a request for it.

"
1173,"Introverts are often reserved and prefer to spend time alone. They are also often described as being ""shy"" and ""not gregarious."" Extroversion is a personality trait that is often characterized by being outgoing, social, and engaging. Introvert and extoutation are not binary traits, however, so some people may be described more as introverts than extouts. 
  
In this case, it appears that this is an ambiguous text and the dialogue acts do not align with either introvert or extravert. It is possible that both introversion and extraversion are present in this person, or that neither is present.

"
1174,"Out of question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates a conditional question. It is possible that this person is very reserved and does things only when they have no choice. In this case, they may not have mentioned being outgoing because they are not being asked about it. 
 Out of direct: this is a strong directive. Directives are commands or instructions that are given to someone to do something. Here, this could be considered a request to eat better, so the answer of 'yes' is likely a response to a direct question from the listener. However, there is no conditional or request for the response.

"
1175,"In this example, based on this specific text and the surrounding context, it is clear that this is a 'question' rather than an 'inform,''directive', or 'commissive'. The surrounding text is about a person's preferences in food, so it can reasonably be interpreted as asking about something that would make the person happy.

"
1176,"In this case, it is clear that 'friend in dee' is not asking for confirmation, clarification, nor service. It is an offering of friendship.

"
1177,"Question dialogue acts are used when the information provided by a person is not sufficient to understand the context of their statement. For example, a customer service representative may ask the caller a series of questions to help them better understand a problem they are experiencing. 
  
Overinform dialogue Acts are when a speaker provides too much information, or too little, to a listener, without indicating which information is relevant to which action the person wants the other person to take. An example of overinformation is when someone asks a stranger for directions, but provides a detailed map of every street in a large city. In this case, there is no indication which streets are relevant, so the response is overinformative.

"
1178,"Out of the four dialogue acts provided, inform is the most appropriate. ""Personal weaknesses"" is an informational statement, not a command or request for a response. It does not indicate a desire for the person answering to do or not do anything.

"
1179,"'whatfor' is the word used in this context to seek clarification. This is characteristic a of question in dialogue acts. 
  
Inform is one of the four possible dialogue Acts. The other three are question, directive and commissives.

"
1180,"Overinform: the prediction includes information that is either not present in this context or is highly unlikely to appear in a conversation of a workplace. For example, it includes the statement that ""this is the first time"" or ""i am new to this workplace"".
Question: there is a strong indication in context that a person is likely to ask questions. The context includes ""tell [me] a bit"" and ""please"". 
  
Directive: this prediction is based on a clear indication of direction in conversation. In this case, there are two indicators: ""you should"" in response to ""a little about [yourself]""; and the directive ""call me"" to a recipient who is ""everybody"" calls thesender ""monica"". 
Commissive : this type of prediction does include a request for something of value, but it also includes a sense of obligation or commitment. There is no indication that this person has any obligation to work with the person being addressed.

"
1181,"I was not a leader when I was a student, since I did not assume a position of leadership until after I graduated from college.

"
1182,"In the given example, it is not clear whether the person is asking a direct question or giving a directive. Based on this, we predict that it should be classified under inform rather than question. However, there is a strong implication that this person was asking the question because of their action of writing the ticket, and this is classified in question under question and directive under directive and commissIVE. 
  
Yes, I was the president for the Student Council of my University.

"
1183,"Question dialogue acts are used to seek clarification from the other person. The speaker is seeking confirmation or clarification about something the listener has said or done. For example, a person might ask, ""Did you do your homework?"" or ""Where did you go to college?"". 
  
In this case, it is not clear from this question whether the student was awarded any honor or not. Therefore, this is a query dialogueact.

"
1184,"Inform (or provide information) is a basic and important aspect of human communication. Without providing information to another person, it is impossible for that person to respond to your request or take an action. Therefore, providing the information in this example is an important part of the conversation. 
  
Question (ask a direct question) can be used when you are trying to understand something more deeply or clarify something that is unclear. In this case, ""doyou havethe manand thesea"" is not a clear question and doesnot provide enough information for the reader to answer. However, by asking the question ""did you ever hear of' the man' and 'the sea', the author is trying  to understand if the person has ever heard of these two people or not. This is where the interrogative structure of question comes into play. By asking this question the writer is attempting to clarify whether the answer is 'yes' or 'no'. 
   
Directive (give an order) are used to tell someone what to do. The author in the example does this by saying ""Let'sgo!"". ""Go!"" is the order to move ahead with what the speaker is suggesting. While this is also an example of directive communication, there is more information provided in order for this to be classified under this heading. First, we know that the 'Letsgo!' is part  of a conversation, so we can assume that there was a previous question asked. Second, 'go' is used as an imperative, a command to go.  This is important because it tells us that 'Go!' was not just a statement of intent, but a request for action from the other person.   

   commissives (make a pledge or promise)  are used for when someone is making a serious commitment to something, like a marriage or a job. 'Weed! You know. Pot, Ganja. Mary Jane some Chronic!' does contain a recommendation or suggestion for use, however, this does more than just recommend something to someone. These words are also a binding commitment between the two parties. If someone were to say 'I don't want to use that word anymore, Mary J is too strong a word for it.' This would be considered a commissIVE communication because the word is no longer just something the listener might use. They have committed to not use it anymore.

"
1185,"I was involved with a student society at my university. 
  The society was active for a short period of time, between two and four years, and had no official status.

"
1186,"'i was member' indicates the first part of speech of 'was a'. This is an adjective describing the second part'member of'. Therefore, this part is a noun, and the dialogue acts of were, are, etc. have been grouped as noun. 
'thank you' is the response to 'you like to write poems'. It is considered an answer, as it is in the inform category.

"
1187,"Question is the most likely dialogueact given the context. The question is asking the listener for information. 
Overinform is another possibility. This is when the information provided is too much or too little. In this case, it is likely that question was the intended dialogue action. 
  
  Question: ""what extra curriculars did u usually participate in?""
    Overinform: I participated in a dozen of them.

  The text is also seeking an assessment or evaluation. An assessment is an opinion or a judgment. Based on this context, assessment seems like a better fit for this situation. Assessment is more likely than question because it implies the questioner is trying to get information from another person. A question would be more appropriate.  

"
1188,"In this example, ""i played some table football and some basketball"" is a general statement about two different activities, and does NOT indicate which activity the author played. Therefore, this is an overinform dialogueact. 
  
However, if the sentence was modified to indicate that the table soccer and basketball activities were played by the same person, then the dialogue acts would become more likely to become question or directive. For example:

""I played a table table-tennis and a basketball.""
  ""Please play some soccer with my table.""

"
1189,"This text contains a request for details about a planned event. The request is for specific details, such as the location, speakers, etc. It is not a general request to share information or provide general background information that can apply to multiple situations.

"
1190,"Question is a type of dialogue action that is used when someone is requesting information, or making decisions. The question in the above text can be interpreted as asking the recipients opinion on whether or not to include lower-level employees in an event. 
Directive is another type dialogue actions that are used to guide the direction of the communication. In this case,  the question can also be seen as directing the lower employees' attendance at the event, so that they can participate in it.

"
1191,"In this example, it can be seen that ""oh so does i."" is an expression of agreement. The speaker agrees with something that has just been said. In this case, there was a previous discussion about whether or not lower level executives need to attend the training. ""Oh sodoes i"" is a way of expressing agreement with that statement.

"
1192,"Out ofinform: the yoga class is suitable only for experienced practitioners. The sender does NOT seek information from or confirm the suitability of the class for a beginner. 
Overinform,question: what is the level of yoga experience required to attend this class? Is it suitable to start with?
Directive: attend the next class. Go to class!
Commissive : I will attend class, but only if the instructor is competent. 
  I will not attend a class if I feel the teacher is not qualified to teach.

"
1193,"Question dialogue acts are used to seek clarification or to request information from the listener. In this case, it appears that ""what"" the person wants to know is ""how"" they can meet the individual for a second time. This is an example of asking a ""question"" and not an ""informative"" statement. 
Overinform dialogue Acts are a form of hedging, where a speaker provides too much information to the receiver, and is therefore asking for confirmation. The statement ""i can"" is overinform, as it provides more information than is necessary. 
  
Inform dialogueacts are statements that provide information without asking questions or making promises. ""I can"", in this context, provides information that is not asked for, but is still helpful to understanding the request.

"
1194,"Inform is used when the information provided is about the past. In this case, ""i bought a paper here"" is the present action and ""yesterday"" thepast action. The information is therefore about past events and doesnot require much energy to process. 
Question is when someone is asking for information. ""why did you buy a piece of paper?"" is a request for explanation. 
 Directive is  used when a person is giving instructions.  ""come here"", ""take a seat"", or ""go to the store"" are examples of directives. These instructions require some energy for processing but are usually carried out by a human.

"
1195,"In this case, it seems that people who do yoga tend to sweat more than people that do not do any form of exercise. Therefore, this is considered an overinform dialogueact. 
However, I would like to point out that this classification is based on only one example and that there could be other factors that influence the sweating of people doing any type of physical exercise, such as the type and intensity of the exercise or the weather conditions.

"
1196,"In this case, it is not clear whether the person asking the question is in need or not. If the asker is indeed in a need, then the inform dialogue acts are the most appropriate. However, if the inquirer is simply curious, a simple question like this would be a request for information.

"
1197,"the text asks a person to try a new activity,
it does so by stating that it is no trouble for the asker, who is young and single, to do so, 
and it does this by directing the listener to take the initiative and try the activity.

"
1198,"Question: We are wondering if you speak both spoken and written English. 
Overinform: I believe I can speak spoken English
question: and I also believe that I could speak written english

We are also looking to hire a secretary, and we would like to find someone who is bilingually proficiency. Do you have any suggestions? 
  
  The text indicates the need for the secretary to speak and write English, so it can be classified a commissIVE dialogue. 
   
   We would also like the candidate to have bicultural proficiencies, but we do not know if they are able to fulfill both requirements. Therefore, it could be considered a CommissIVE question as well.

"
1199,"the given textual content does not ask any question. it provides information and states a factual fact. 
it does provide a suggestion or an advice. 
  it also does make some promises or commitments.

"
1200,"In the given example, ""okAY"" is used as a response marker, indicating that a future event is being described. In this case, it's the next outting. 
""kARA"" indicates the person being addressed, and is therefore used for inform or question
the ""the movies"" are being mentioned, so it would be a commissitive dialogue
act.

"
1201,"Inform is a special case of question that is used when the questioner is not seeking specific information but instead is simply seeking to understand the answer to a general question or request. Inform can also be used in place of the word question when asking a person to do something.

"
1202,"This text is offering a suggestion to what clothes should be washed. It is not a request for information or a recommendation. Therefore, it falls under question dialogue acts. 
  
  The question is ""what clothes?"" and the response is the list of options. ""What clothes?  You mean like this?"" This clarifies the question and provides the options for the answer.

"
1203,"the text contains a request for information (i would like to get my items back)

and the dialogue acts of question are overinform,  question, directiv, commissive.

"
1204,"Inform is an action that conveys facts or information to a listener without asking for confirmation. In this case, inform is used to indicate that a list of items has already been provided, and the receiver is expected to confirm whether they have seen the items. 
  
Question is another action used for seeking clarification or asking a direct question from another person.  In this example, a simple question has arisen from this greeting.

"
1205,"In this example, ""have that... drycleaned"" is the directive act. The person was asking the speaker to do something, and the action was to have the suit cleaned (dry cleaned). The speaker obliged.

"
1206,"This text is suggesting that I should use certain ingredients to prepare a dish. This implies the author is giving directions or instructions on how to do something. 
In addition, this is a business text. It is likely that this author wants to sell their product or service. Therefore, it makes sense that they would want to suggest a way to accomplish their goal.

"
1207,"Question: I'm not sure if this is something you should worry about, or if you need to see a doctor. 
Information: You should not worry, you are in good health. 
  Question (continued): Do you feel tired all the time? 
   Information (continuation): I do. I am often tired and feel sluggish. However, I have not seen a physician to check if I might have a medical condition.

"
1208,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask questions, and they are often used in casual conversation. The question in this example is asking if the person is afraid of high bloodpressure. This is a typical question that is asked in a casual setting. 
In this case, it is clear that this is not a direct request, but rather a statement of fact. Therefore, this would fall under the question dialogue type. 
  
Overinform dialogue Acts are similar to questions in that they ask for information, however, they provide too much information. In this instance, there is no indication that highbloodpressure is dangerous, so the information provided is unnecessary.  This is an overinform type of dialogue.

"
1209,"In the beginning of your message, you mentioned that ""the text is asking confirmation of something"". This implies the message is requesting information from the receiver. 
However, when the dialogue acts are predicted, it is predicted as a direct question instead of an indirect question or request. Indirect questions are usually followed by a statement of request or confirmation. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue: A Theory of Meaning"" by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, a typical question in English is: ""Is it true?"". A typical confirmation is ""yes"".
So, in the example you gave, ""okay"" is the confirmation, and ""that shall"" the directive.

"
1210,"This text could be seen as offering or suggesting to the listener to take a break, and the directive dialogue acts are used to express the suggestion. 
  
  The speaker recommends taking a short break to allow for recovery and to avoid burnout.

"
1211,"the text doesn’t provide information, so the predict dialogue
  actiom is question
although the first part of the sentence is about slowing down, it’s
    not a request for the person to slowdown, therefore the
   predicted dialogue action is directive

A:
According to your explanation, you can predict that the dialog act will be question because the beginning of sentence ""although"" is used to express a reason or explanation. 
However, I think the reason why you cannot predict the correct dialog action in this case is because ""slow down"" in the second part is not a statement about something that John does, but a suggestion for John to do. So the statement is actually a recommendation. And the recommendation is usually given to a person who is in a position of authority or has the ability to carry out the action. In this way, ""John slow  down"" can also be considered as a kind of order.

"
1212,"the text does ask an open-ended question: ""look at that""
it does give an answer: the weight of the person
but the answer is not a request for information, rather it is a warning: look what will happen if you continue to weigh so much.

"
1213,"This text asks the question ""are [you] more a [leader] or [a] [follower]?"". The answer to this question requires a response from [the person] being asked. 
  
  Based off of the provided text and the dialogue structure, this is likely a  question dialogueact.

"
1214,"Directive is an assertive act that conveys a strong message to another person. In this case, it is likely that the driver of a car that ran the redlight is telling the police officer that you should be more careful when driving and should not run red lights. 
  
Overinform is another term for directive. This is when the other person is not given enough information to understand what to do. Here, because of how the sentence is constructed, we can assume that this is the case. ""You've gotten to...take more...exercise."" The driver is being asked to take exercise, but does not know much about it. Therefore, they respond with more information.

"
1215,"Question is an active, probing dialogueact, as it encourages the other person to share information and express opinions. In this case, ""what do I do?""

In contrast, inform is passive, offering information without prompting for a response. 
  
question: ""What do  you do? ""
inform:  ""I am an Early Bird. What do You do In The Morning?""

"
1216,"the text implies a positive sentiment towards the suggested course or action. 
it does provide new and useful information, since the speaker suggests that we shouldn't pass up the mornings hours without doing something worthwhile.

"
1217,"Question: ""so,"" is a questioning phrase that indicates a request for clarification. In this context, ""you"" is the questioner, who is seeking an answer from the other person. The ""where"" part of the sentence is an interrogation question that seeks an explicit answer. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive: the dialogue acts of ""i"" and ""don"" are questions, so is ""then"" which indicates an imperative.

"
1218,"the text provides only information, not a direct question. 
it does provide a statement of fact, such as the weather is warm, so i should go to black bamboow park. However, it does so without asking for confirmation or providing a way to confirm the information. 
  

A:
According to this article, there are four possible answers for a text to fall into a certain category: 

 

Out of: Inform, Question, Directive, Commisive
Over:  Inform (Over In, Over Out), Question (Often In), Direct (Directive), Comm (Commisitive)
In (In)

"
1219,"In this context, 'exercises' could be interpreted as a verb, and thus the question is about performing the exercises. The speaker wants to know how often the other person performs the exercise. 
  
If the dialogue acts were inform or directive instead, then the 'how often' part of the sentence would be understood as an adverb, not a noun.

"
1220,"Inform is a dialogue acting pattern where the sender is simply providing or sharing information to the receiver. In this case,'so do I' is the information being shared. 
  
Overinform is when the message contains too much information. This text contains a lot of information, but it is not a directive or commissIVE message. Therefore, Overinform.  

"
1221,"""stay in the bed"" is an order, not a request or a recommendation. 
Exercise is a good thing to do, regardless of whether you feel fit or not. 
  If you don’t feel like exercising, you can still do other things, like taking a nap.  

A:
According to the model, ""stay"" inbed is the direct object of ""exercise"".
In this case, it is likely that the writer is trying to encourage the reader to exercise.

"
1222,"In this example, it is interesting that the dialogue acts are not entirely consistent. In particular, inform is a better prediction than question or directive. This is because inform indicates that there is some information shared between the two speakers, but it does not specify what the information is. question indicates a conversation is taking place, while directive indicates an instruction is being given. Therefore, in addition to the textual evidence, there are also non-textual factors that can help determine the correct dialogue tag.

"
1223,"In this case, singing seems like it would be a way to keep fit mentally, but the context of the sentence makes clear that singing would not be effective for that purpose. The sentence is a negative one, meaning that there is no evidence to support the claim that one would actually be able to sing to maintain mental fitness.

"
1224,"Directive is one of the four types of dialogue acts. This text is asking a listener for recommendations of cosmeceuticals. 
  
Out of directive: the given request is for the recommendation of specific cosmeticals, and the request does  not require any response or action from listener. In other words, this is not a directive dialogue, as the requested action is from speaker to listener, rather than the other way around. 
Question: this type of question is expected in a dialogue of request and response. However, in this case, there is no request or response required from other party. Therefore the question type is out of scope.  

"
1225,"This text indicates the need to do a certain task, and the task is to take the Boss to an airport, but no one is doing it. So, it is a directive act.

"
1226,"In the beginning of your message, you mention that you are a native speaker of English. Based on this, I would expect the classification of dialogue acts to be more accurate than the one given by the model. 
However, it is important to note that even native speakers can make mistakes when trying out a model for the first time. Therefore, always try to validate the predictions of NLP models with human feedback.

"
1227,"the predicted label is overinform, since the dialogue acts inform and inform are both considered to be correct;
question, inform or directive are considered correct as a predicted result; 
commissive is considered incorrect as the result of the prediction.

"
1228,"Out of question: the question marks at end make it look like the
  speaker is ending the statement, rather than asking another question

In question : the use ""What about..."" indicates the subject of inquiry is something the listener should know about
Directive: ""do this"" or ""be that"" are examples of directives used in
the text
Commission: this is the word used to describe a request for
information or a clarification
Commissive : this word is used for both question and directive
over Commissive, Question, Directive and Commissiv
Note: Commissives are used when the information is not for the purpose of
communication, for example when a doctor tells a patient that they have
cancer.

"
1229,"Directive is an assertive or commanding dialogue acts that are used for requesting or ordering someone to do something. In this case, Steven is being asked for advice and is ordered to answer the question posed to him. 
Out of direct inform: Steven provides information to the asker, but does so without giving instructions. He does this by providing advice on what to expect when flying abroad for for  the first  time. 
  
Question: What should I pay  attention to when I am flying? 
   
In this question Steven's answer will provide instructions on how to fly.

"
1230,"the text is asking John to consider soup as a possible option
it is providing John with information about the soup
John is being asked to make some decision or take an action

second, what is the best way to prepare for jetlag?
First, make sure to have a good night's sleep the night before your travel. Second, try to find a comfortable position during the flight, preferably in a window seat. Third, avoid eating close to the airport, and try not to drink a lot of fluids. Fourth, take a nap during your layover. Finally, on arrival, go for walks as much as possible.

"
1231,"In this example, ""i'll go bedearly tonight"" can be interpreted as a request, so the dialogue acts are question and request. However, it can also be seen as an explanation, where ""going to sleep early"" would be the explanation for why ""Mike"" will be going to ""bed."" In this case, inform is the most appropriate dialogue action.

"
1232,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask questions, and they are the most likely to reveal the true intent of the speaker. In this case, if the response is negative, then the question dialogueact is likely a denial or a challenge. If the answer is positive, than the person asking the questions is trying to convince the other person to take an action. 
  
In this example, there are two possible responses:

Negative response: ""I'm not feeling well""
Positive response (encouraging the asker): ""don't worry, i've had worse""

"
1233,"Overinform: the statement provides more information than is necessary to make the point being made. For example, if the information provided were not sufficient to understand the conclusion, then it would be overinform. 
Question: there is a request for information, indicating that someone is looking for confirmation or approval. 
  If the request is not met, there will be a reaction to the non-response.  
Directive: this is an order or request to do something. If the order is refused, a response is required.   
Commissive (or commissuroidal): this indicates a discussion about what to order. The order must be accepted before a reply is given.

"
1234,"Inform: the author is providing the information that they are bringing some medication for Airsick. 
Question: although the question is implied by the structure of ""you do something again?"", the reader needs to ask the asker for the answer. 
  
Directive: this is the most interesting one, and the reason why the dialogue is classified this way. The author seems like they expect the person to do or not do certain actions, but they don’t provide any guidance or direction on what to actually do. They are just giving orders or advices. This is a very common type of directive.

"
1235,"In this example, I provided the context of the conversation, along with some of what was said. Based on this context, it is clear that this is a text that shares personal information. The speaker was sharing that they prefer to work collaboratively and not by leading. This is in contrast to the approach they described in the previous example. 
  
This text shares information regarding the sale of a product. It does not ask for a question or give instructions. Rather, this information is provided to help the reader understand the price.

"
1236,"Out of the four possible dialogue acts, this is the only one that is not a recommendation or request. Instead, it is an order or directive. 
  
  The speaker has asked the question ""can"" we look for houses at the specified time. This is a directive question. 
In addition, there is also the commissitive act, which is used when the other party is expected to carry out an action. In this case, ""you"" are expected ""to"" look ""for"" houses. However, in this context, since the timeframe is so short, you will not have enough time ""look"" for a house.

"
1237,"Question: the best time of day to take a trip is dependent on several factors, such as the destination, weather, and the driver's preferences. The question of when to travel is best left to the individual. 
Inform: it is not recommended to make travel decisions in an emergency situation. It is better to wait until you have more information. 
  

Commissive: I'm sorry you were inconvenienced. I will make sure to be more careful in my future travels.

"
1238,"Inform is the default dialogue action for messages that are not asking questions or seeking confirmation. 
  
  Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive

"
1239,"Directives are used when one person (the sender) is making an offer or request of another person, and the other person has a choice in whether or not to accept the offer. In this case, ""would that"" is a request for the receiver's opinion, or a suggestion. 
  
Question marks indicate that a speaker (sender) seeking clarification from another.

"
1240,"""yep, that's what i thought"" is an example of over-interpreting the given text. In this case, interpreting the question as a command would be incorrect, because the command form of question is ""how,"" not ""why.""

A:
According to the book ""Text to Speech for Dummies"" by John Swets, there are four possible answers to a ""What else do ya know?"" question: 
1. ""I don't know. Ask the asker.""  (inform)
2.  ""I do know; let me look it up."" (question)  
 
3.   ""Let me call my friend who is really good at this stuff. He'll know.""  (directive) 
   4.    ""No, I don’t know that. Let me check my notes.""  (commissive/request)

 

"
1241,"Directives are used when two or more people are involved in a conversation and they are expected to take action on a given message. In this case, there is a request for the listener to pick a location for a meeting. 
  
Out of directive: the request is for information, not for someone else to do something. The directive act does occur in this example, but it's an outlier.

"
1242,"In the given scenario, it is clear that this is a request for assistance. Based on this, we can predict that there is an ask in this dialogue. Therefore, this example is classified under directive.

"
1243,"Directive is a directive dialogueact, meaning it conveys a command or order. The sentence ""it will most likely take the rest of today"" is an example of directive language, as it gives an order or directive to do something. 
In this case, ""Mike, you should think about five different houses we could look into today. It will likely require most the entire day."" is the type of language that is typically used in a direct order, rather that a request for question or information. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Textual Criticism: An Introduction"", the following are the most common types of dialogue acts: 

 
Out of Inform: This is used when the speaker is not sure about something and wants to check with their addressee before giving a definite answer.
 
Question: In this type, one or both of them are unsure about a particular topic and want to know more about it. They are looking for an answer to a hypothetical question and are asking it to their partner. 
 
Request: Here, both the speakers want something from their other. In other words, they are in need of each other's help. Both the parties are aware of that fact and they want the other to help them.
 

 commissives: These are used to express agreement or disagreement. For example, if one of you says that you are hungry, your partner will probably say that they too are feeling hungry. This type is also used for expressing approval or disapproval. If one person says ""that's a nice dress"", their friend will usually say ""thank you"".
 

"
1244,"Inform: the message is providing basic information to the recipient. 
Question: there is a request in the sentence, but the question mark is not followed by a answer. 
  Directive: a person is being instructed to take an action.  
Commissive : the person being addressed is the one asking for this action, so this is likely a conversation between two people.

"
1245,"Directive is a special type of command used to make an employee or subordinate do something. In this case, a car driver is being told how to get to a destination. 
  

In the example provided, there is no confirmation that a reply has actually been sent. Therefore, this is classified under directive as the reply hasn't been confirmed yet.

"
1246,"In the given example, 'do' is an auxiliary verb, and it is used to link the main verb 'have' and the question word 'a packagetour to Hollywood'. The auxiliary 'to' indicates a request or a wish, hence the classification as a 'question' act (as opposed to the other dialogue acts of the example).

"
1247,"Question is a way of expressing uncertainty or asking questions. In this case, it is used to express preference between two options. The options are the dates that a speaker plans to attend a given location. Based on this information, a listener would like to know which date the listener likes best. 
  
In this example, ""which date"" is an instruction or direction, and therefore question is appropriate.

"
1248,"Question: ""how much"" is the tour?""

This question is asking for an amount, and therefore it has a commissitive dialogueact.

"
1249,"Inform is used to provide information without seeking a confirmation. 
Question is another way to seek confirmation from the other person. When someone asks a Question, they are expecting an answer from their interlocutor. If the interlocutors are not in a position to answer the question (e.g. they don't know the answer), they will use the Commissive dialogue acts to ask for more information or clarification. 
  
Directive is an action that is meant to influence the choice of the receiver. In other words, it is the action of an actor that intends to change the behavior of another actor.  

"
1250,"Directive is the most general dialogue acts. Directives are used to tell someone what to do or to make it clear who is in charge. In this example, we can say that the customer is being directive because they are asking the salesperson for a brochure. 
Over directive is a more specific type of directive. Over directives are often used when two or more people are in a position to give orders to each other. For example: ""You go first, then me, second"" is an example of a over directive where the second order is given by the first person who went first. 
  
Question is another general type dialogue Acts. Questions are a way to get information from someone. The customer in this case is likely asking questions about how much the purchase will cost.

"
1251," commissives are used to express strong requests or commands, and are often used in the negative, to convey a strong prohibition or commandment. For example, ""Don't run in our yard"" or ""Stop throwing that rock!""

In this case, it appears that the author is requesting someone else to keep a book safe, indicating a commissIVE act

"
1252,"In this example, ""things are out-of-hand"" and ""you keep putting your
nose where  it doesn't belong"" suggest that there is a problem in the
conversation. The speaker may be frustrated or annoyed. 
""Things are going out  of hand"" is an idiom that means ""going out
of control"".

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue for Dummies"", the dialogue acts are as follows: 

 

Out:  yes
Question: yes, I have book a  room for  24th it’s a duble room
Directive: how much  is it?
Request: of course it  ’ s area  code 6261 - 55 -  1739
Information: it ‘ s a phone  number with  area code

"
1253,"Question is used in this context because of the introductory phrase ""ok"" which is followed immediately by a request for a reply. This suggests that there is uncertainty about the meaning of ""that shall"" and that someone else (the addressee) should clarify this meaning. 
  
In contrast, directives and commissives are used elsewhere in the conversation to indicate a clear and specific action to be taken.

"
1254,"Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are similar, so it is difficult to tell which one is being used. Inform is used in the first sentence to introduce the new employee, and the second sentence is a query. Question is the correct dialogue action for the third sentence, as it indicates the employee is trying something out. However, in this context, inform is more appropriate, because the information provided in that sentence (the phone numbers) is for informational purposes only. 
Question: this is where the predict label changes to question. the sentence starts with a request for another chance, indicating that it’s a directive dialogue. question is also used for a second time in a sentence that starts out with information, where it can also be used to indicate a informational request. 
  In this case, however, since the request is to give another shot, then it should be commissitive. commissives are used when the person asking is making an order or giving an instruction. Since the order is “can you try it again?” then commissivity is appropriate.

"
1255,"Because the list of items being requested is not provided by the sender, it is reasonable to assume that they are items that mom may need while shopping. 
Also, because the request is for a single item (a coat), it suggests a more specific instruction, i.e. a recommendation.

"
1256,"In this example, enough is a strong signal that you should expect the inform dialogue
  act. The speaker has provided enough information for their request to be fulfilled. In
   this case, they have asked for mrs. sands's phone #, and they've provided the phone
number. This is not a good dialogueact to expect if you don't know mary s.sands.

"
1257,"This text uses the word ""mind"" to guide the response. This is an example of ""over informing"" because the answer to the question ""do you minds if I smoke?"" would be ""no,"" but the actual response is ""yes, I mind."" This indicates the writer is directing the dialogue towards an outcome or a decision that needs to be made. 
  
Mr. Chen, would you be willing to smoke with me? 
   
Yes, of course. I would love to.

"
1258,"This is a clear example of a commissIVE message, where the main focus is on punishing the smoker for breaking the rules. The sender states that they are sorry for the inconvenience, but they cannot allow the smoking activity in their office, because they have rules against it. 
  
On the contrary, if the rule is broken, then the messenger should be more concerned about providing the necessary information to rectify the situation, rather than punitively punishes the person breaking that rule.

"
1259,"Question: This text is asking the question 'Can I help You?'. The speaker has provided information in the form of 'goodmorning' and is expecting a response. Based on this information, it is likely that they are either looking for someone to help them with something or are expecting someone from a certain location to show up. 
  
Inform: In this case, if the dialogue acts were to be classified using the information provided in this sentence, then the act would be inform. Inform is the correct dialogue action to use in response to this question as it indicates the type of information that was provided. 'Goodmorning', although providing the greeting, does provide no additional information. Therefore, this is an example of a non-inform question.

"
1260,"'over' indicates that the model predicted more than one category for this dialogue action. 
'the' is a pronoun, and it refers to the 'dialogue action' in the previous line. 
  'inform', 'question',  'directive', and 'commissive' are the categories that were predicted.

"
1261,"In this context, ""juice"" is an ambiguous term that could refer to any type of drink. Based on this, it could be inferred that ""you prefer"" could mean ""do you like"" or ""would you enjoy."" However, if the question is seeking clarifications, then it would be classified under question as the use and meaning of the word ""prefer"" in this sentence is unclear.

"
1262,"Directive dialogue acts are used when the conversation is about asking someone else to take an immediate action. For example, if I ask you to make me a coffee, I am asking you for a service, and a direct dialogue is used to communicate this request (similar to how you would use the word ""please"" in a polite request). 
  
In contrast, inform and question dialogue Acts are typically used for providing general information or asking questions about something that is happening around you. 
    
Commissive acts can express a wish or a suggestion. They are not requests, but requests are classified under commissives.

"
1263,"""American breakfast"" is a noun, so it could be a direct question. However, ""American Breakfast"" could also be an adjective describing the item being described, in which case it would be considered an attributive adjectival phrase. 
  
  ""with fried Eggs Sunny Side Up"" describes the breakfast item. This is an attribute of the food item itself, not a description of how the owner feels about it. 
Therefore, this is considered a ""question"" because it contains a clause with a subject and a verb.

"
1264,"Inform is a directive dialogueact that indicates a speaker wants the other person to do something. 
  
  The text asks the person who answers the question if China is indeed the home of Tea. If the answer is no, then the next step is to ask for more information. In this case, inform is appropriate.

"
1265,"Question is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to seek clarification or to request information. The recipient of the message is expected to provide an answer to the question. In this case, based on this message, we do not know if the person who will be arriving will provide assistance or not, so the response should be marked as a query. 
  
Out of question and question are similar in that they are both types of questions, however, out of is used in a different context. Out of means ""from"" and is typically used with a preposition to indicate that something came from somewhere else. For example, ""I went to a party and brought back a present for you."" ""Out Of question! That's impossible! I never asked you to go to any party.""

In contrast, questions are a type or dialogue Acts used for seeking clarification and/or requesting information from the receiver of an message.

"
1266,"Inform (also called report or explain) is an act that conveys one's understanding or acceptance of something. The inform act can also be used to convey a request for clarification or additional information. 
  
  Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the most common.

"
1267,"In this example, ""question"" is used to describe a dialogue action that is not asking for something, but rather seeking and gathering information to make an informed decision. 
  
  The text ""are they available?"" is clearly asking a yes/no question about whether someone is available to travel.

"
1268,"Directive dialogue acts are used to request a specific action or behavior from the other person. In this case, you are being asked to put the item on a table. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue: A Corpus Study"" by John C. Wells, there is a difference between directive and commissives.  A commissIVE is used when you want to make an agreement or commitment. For example, ""I'll do it if you pay me $10.""  In contrast, a directive is when someone is telling you what to do. ""Turn off the lights.""

"
1269,"Question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the
  speaker is looking for more information, so it is classified here. 
  Overinform: ""anything else"" is too general, it does not provide enough
information to answer the query. Question: I'm hungry, do you want me to
get you something to eat? 
 Question Mark: yes, I would like you to get me something  to eat.

"
1270,"Directive is the most extreme form of the four possible acts, and is used when the sender is attempting to influence the receiver's behavior. In this case, ""no"" is being interpreted by the addressee as a request for more juice, when in fact the message is meant to convey ""oh, no, please do not give me any more"".

Inform is an act that seeks information, either from a recipient or in order to better understand a situation. ""Have you heard about oolong and Compressed tea?"" is seeking information in the form ""have you encountered these two types or not?"". 
  
Question is another extreme act, used only when there is some ambiguity in what the questioner is requesting. Here, it's not clear whether the request is for information or for something else. For example, if a person asks ""are you coming to my party?"", a reasonable answer might not be ""yes"", but rather ""I'm not sure, are you?"" 
   
Commissive acts are the least extreme, indicating that something has gone wrong in some way. If the person who sent the email is unable to produce the requested juice (perhaps because they are out of it), the response should be to apologize and try again later. However, in this example the ""No, thank you"" response is interpreted in a way that is contrary to the intent of sending the original message.

"
1271,"Question: ""What kind?""
Inform: Sir, we like orange juice. 
Directive: Please specify your favorite juice sir. 
 Commissive : Thank you for your feedback.

"
1272,"Inform is used when someone is giving information to another person. In this case, it appears that someone (the speaker) is providing information about a request from another (listener) person, so inform is the most appropriate dialogue action. 
  
Question is another dialogueaction used to ask a person a direct question or to request clarification. The question here is whether the person requesting the orange or the tomato juice. Based on this context, a yes/no question is most likely. Therefore, this is also a use of question in this example. 
Directive is when one person gives orders to someone else. Here, someone in the kitchen is ordering the juice for the guest. So this could be considered a command. However, in most cases, commands are given to an individual, not to a group. As a result, command is not the best choice in context. Directive would be a better choice. Commands are usually given in a superior-subordinate relationship, and the order is usually followed without any question from recipient.  So command would not be appropriate here. Commissive, on  the other hand, is an act that is done out of duty or obligation. It is often considered as a negative act. For example, if you are asked to do something that you do not want to, then you would consider it as commissitive. But in general, Commissitive is considered to have a positive connotation. Since the act in question requires the purchase of weed, one would assume that it is being done for a good reason, i.e., to help the receiver. Thus, based on these context clues, we can say that commissative is more appropriate than directive in describing this act, as it has a neutral connotations.

"
1273,"the text is in a polite, conversational tone, suggesting that it would be appropriate to help the caller by signing the bill
it requests the recipient to first sign the document, making it a demand
there is no mention of any action the sender is taking, so the directive label is appropriate

A:
According to the model, ""sun-set hotel"" is the topic of the conversation.  ""sun"" and ""set"" are the attributes of that topic. ""hotel"" could be the name of an entity in that conversation, but it's also a topic in and of itself. So, in this case, you could say ""the sun- set Hotel"" or ""Sun-Set Hotel"".  The hotel could also be an attribute of ""topic"".
""may"" can be used as a verb, and it can also mean ""permission"" in some contexts. In this context, I think it means ""be able to"". So ""May I"" help him?  I may be able help.

"
1274,"Directive is the most general dialogueact, and is used for asking someone to do something. In this case, it is likely being used to ask the driver of the car to speed up, given that they are in a rush and are likely going to a destination quickly. 
Overinform is another general term for an incorrect prediction, in this instance the response that was given, that it would take several hours to travel to Londont. The response was incorrect, as the time was much shorter than the stated duration. 
  Question is one of four predicted labels for this dialogueAct, indicating that there is ambiguity in the statement. For example, ""is this a short drive or a long drive?"". Here, there may be two different answers to the question ""how far is it?"", one for short drives and one  for long drives. Directive would be the correct response in that case. However, if the answer is clear, then the dialogue Act is commissIVE, meaning that a specific action has already been taken, so there isn't any ambiguity.

"
1275,"""how much"" is ""normal?"" is an open-ended question that invites the reader to provide an answer. Based on this context, it seems likely that ""how"" much something is is not a precise question but rather a statement of uncertainty.

"
1276,"the text asks a direct question about the price of weed. 
it does so by using a commanding tone and providing a price estimate. The estimate is not based on any information provided in the rest of text. 
  
In contrast, if the dialogueact had been overinform, then the response would have been: 

 

'yes', 'i have', and 'it's' are all information words. 'Weed', however, is a name or term for a drug, so it is neither information nor a part of a named entity. Therefore, 'weed' is an unknown word, making it over-inform.

"
1277,"In this example, inform is overinform, because it is possible for the dialogue to continue with the same predicted act, but the context makes it clear that this is not what the writer intended. The writer is expressing gratitude for an opportunity to make up for their mistake, and the act that they chose to express this gratitude with is an inform one, so that other people know that their apology was accepted.

"
1278,"In this example, ""the train to Tibet leaves at what time?"" appears to
  be a direct question from the employee of the bookshop. However, it can
be seen that this is actually a statement of information. ""The train
takes 8 hours to get to Lhasa. You will arrive around noon."" This
information is being provided to a customer who is looking to find
out how long it will take to travel to and from Lhaos. As such, this
statement is classified under question because it contains a
question-mark-type verb (i.e. takes), and the answer is provided via
indirect information (the time it takes to go to, and then return from,
Lhasat).

"
1279,"Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the most appropriate because this is a statement of fact, not a request for information or a command. 
Question is also possible, but this would be a very unusual use of that word. 
  Directive is possible as well, because of course the person is telling Mike to leave, however, this seems to be an unusual directive for Mike, who is clearly not in a position to decide whether or not to stay. Committing is another possibility, since the sentence mentions a ""move back"" home, which could be interpreted as an instruction to travel to a new location. However, there is nothing in this sentence that suggests that Mike is making any kind of commitment to do so. So, out of question and directive.

"
1280,"In this example, ""when"" is used as a temporal marker. When used in a text as an indicator of time, it usually indicates a point in the past or a time period in which something happened. In this case, when the book arrives, indicates the time when it will arrive. Therefore, this indicates it may be question in nature.

"
1281,"Inform is the most common dialogue acts in this example. The speaker informs the listener of a current fact, such as the time or the date. For example, ""it is 7:30 a."" The inform dialogue is followed by a more specific statement, in which the informer provides additional information. In this case, there is an additional piece of information provided about Dunlin, who is identified as ""i willgraduate frompekinguniversitythisjuly."" This is more than just providing the name of the student. This statement is also a commitment, since the graduate date is specified as July. 
  
Question is another common dialog act in English. However, this is not the case in Chinese. Question is used to ask for information or clarification. ""What is your name?"" ""Who are you?"" Informers are rarely asking for clarification, so question is unlikely in these examples. 
Directive is similar to question in that it asks for a response. But directive is typically used when the asker wants the response to be done a certain way. Directives are often followed with a Commissive, meaning that the information should follow.  ""Go to the store and buy milk."" ""Call your mom and tell her you love her."" In the example above, it would be Commissively followed if the addressee wanted to specify the way in a which direction or how much milk to buy.

"
1282,"Question: ""howmuch isthe ticket?""

This question is asking the price of the train ticket. The information provided in the preceding text is not enough to answer this question. Without knowing the age of person, their marital state, as well as their travel frequency, it is impossible to calculate the cost of train tickets.

"
1283,"In this example, we can see that there is no question being asked, no command being given, nor a guarantee being made. The taxi strike is a current event, so the inform dialogue acts are used to provide information to the reader about this event without asking for confirmation or denial.

"
1284,"Inform is a neutral act, meaning that it does not necessarily indicate a request for information or an instruction. It can also be understood as a statement of fact or information that is already known. In this case, it is used to give a clear and straightforward answer to another statement. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive indicates a guiding or directing the conversaton towards an outcome or decision.

"
1285,"Inform: This is because taxi is providing the information that there is an available taxi that is currently nearby. 
Question: However, this question is asking if the person is available to take a taxi right now. This question does not fit the directive act category. 
  
Directive: In this case, we can see that taxi has given a command or instruction to someone. The command is to go to the location of the query.  This is the characteristic directive of taxi
  request.

"
1286,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask someone a direct question. In this example, ""where do you want to go to?"". Based on this sentence, a ""question"" was detected. 
In this case, however, there is no direct follow-up question to the one asked. Therefore, this is likely a commissIVE dialogue. 
  
Out of question: the phrase 'where you going to' is not a follow up question and is more likely to be a statement.

"
1287,"Inform is a low-intensity conversation act that is used to provide background or context to a message. The inform act can also be used as an introductory conversation opener. Inform acts are often used in combination with question or statement acts to form a conversation. 
  
Question is the highest intensity conversation action. It is an inquiry into the meaning of something, and the intent is to find out something specific. Question acts can be either statement or question forms. Statement question acts ask a specific person or group of people for information. A statement question act may also include a request for confirmation or a directive to do something. Example:  ""Did you enjoy the movie?"" ""Yes, it was excellent."" ""What did you think of it?""  A question question ask for specific information, for example: “Where did the book come from?” “I found it on a website.” 
   
Directive is another high- intensity communication action that conveys a clear order to another person. Directives are used when one person is expected to carry out an action on behalf of another. An example of a direct order is: ‘Call the plumber.’ Example of an informational directive is ‘You can find the phone number on your phone.’ 
    
Commissive are the most intense conversation acts. They are aggressive and confrontational. Commissives can occur between two people, or between a person and a group. Commissives often include an order or request to take action, such as: Attack! Attack!, or: Go! Go!, and they can include threats or intimidation.

"
1288,"This text can be interpreted as a command, as the request ""yours"" is followed immediately by the directive ""hop into."" However, this interpretation is unlikely, given that ""please"" typically indicates an invitation or request for permission. 
  
Instead, it appears that this is likely a commissIVE text. ""Please"" indicates the urgency or importance of what is being requested, and the use here of ""you"" to request the listener to hop into the car indicates some form of request.

"
1289,"Question is the dialogueact of choice for questions that seek information, evaluation, and clarification. 
Inform is typically used for statements that provide information without seeking clarification or evaluation. 
  
Directive is used when giving orders or instructions.  It is often used in combination with Commissive to make a command. Commissives are often combined with a request to form a demand. For example, ""Please do it!"" is CommissIVE + request. ""Stop!"" + directive.

"
1290,"Overinform: the given information is too much, it provides too many details and does too little to help the receiver understand the message. 
Question: some of what is being shared does ask questions, such as 'it is taking about 30 minutes', which makes it aquestion. 
  Directive: there is a request for an action, for example, 'please take the tea', and the information provided does little more than provide a reason for the action being requested.  
Commissive : the request is for something to be done, like 'take the teabag out ofthe bag', so the shared information does more to guide the recipient on how to carry out the requested action than simply providing information.

"
1291,"Question: the fifty-minute mark is a significant milestone in a movie's runtime. The question is whether the protagonist will make it to the end of the movie on time. In this case, it's a yes or no question. 
Inform: fifty is an arbitrary number. A person could be watching a different movie and still be able to make their movie. 
  

Directive: I want to watch the film. I will watch it in fifty minute(s). 
    
Commissive (also known as 'I will'): I promise to finish the watching the films in time, I'll watch them in 50 minutes.

"
1292,"Out ofinform: the dialogue acts of question and directive are not applicable in this context. 
Overinform : the dialogues act does ask for a response and makes a request or commitment (commissive)

It is a collection of jade.

"
1293,"the text contains an instruction to stop, suggesting that a request for directions be followed
there is no indication that this is a directive or commissIVE text in the given context, so it is overinformative

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Staloff, there are 6 possible dialogue acts: 
Out of Inform: ""The speaker does something that is not in keeping with the information they have just given.""
Inform (Question): ""A question is asked by the addressee.""  ""The questioner is asking for information.""   ""Information is being provided to someone."" ""Someone is giving information to another."" 
  ""There is an exchange of information between two people.""  ""Someone has asked someone else to do something.""

 Out Of Question:  “The addressees asks a direct question.” “The asker of the question wants to know something.”   “Someone wants information from another.” 
   “Someone asks another person a questions.”  ”Someone makes a suggestion to a person.”

 Out Of Commissive: “A person is making an order or a demand.”
 CommissIVE:“A request is made by someone.”  
 “An offer is extended by one person to somebody else.”“Somebody is offering to help someone out.” 

  Out of Directive : “There’s a clear indication of who’ll do what, and they’re doing it.”  “It’d be helpful to have a second opinion on this.” ""Somebody’ s making plans to accomplish something, either their own or somebody elses."" “Somebody has a plan for what they want to happen.””Somebody wants somebody to follow them.”""Somebody tells somebody what to DO.""“There seems to be a consensus on what needs to done.”   “It looks like somebody’S taking charge of something for the first time.”    “I’m in charge here.”     “This is what I want done, let’me do it.""    ""I have an opinion about this.""   ""This seems like a good idea to me.""     ""It seems as if somebody has decided to go ahead with something they've been thinking about.""""There doesn’t seem to anybody else who wants this done."" 

"
1294," commissives are often used when a sender does not want the information or direction to appear to come from them (as they are not in control of the message). For example, if a friend were to ask you to dinner, you would not give the invitation if you were busy, or if the friend asked you a personal question you did not wish to answer, then you might consider this a commissIVE. 
  
overinform: the informer is overstepping their bounds and providing too much information to their recipient, making the communication appear too directive. For instance, a relative who is visiting you may give you too many details about their plans, their itinerary, and their expectations of your time with them. The relative may be over-sharing, but this is also a form of communication, so the communicator is sharing too little. 
question: although the question is present in the conversation, it does little to explain the reason for the request. In this case, ""tell [me] a bit"" is the actual request, not a request for information in general. So, although there is a ""question"" present, there isn't much of one. There is no directive present. And, since there are no instructions, this communication is commissively rather than questionably so.

"
1295,"In this example, ""how much luggage do you want to bring?"" is considered a query, because it does not provide information, but rather seeks clarification. The response ""four pieces"" is an answer, and therefore the dialogue acts of the two sentences are combined into a single question.

"
1296,"In the given example, there is no question or request for information. The only thing the person is sharing is their preference to drink tea. This is an example of an informational dialogue acts.

"
1297,"""do"" is a conjunctive word, and it functions as a conjunction. When used as such, ""do"", when followed by the word ""you"", functions to ask the question ""who/what/where/when"". In this case, since the sentence is in the negative form, we can assume that ""have"" or ""don't have"" would be a better choice of words to use instead of ""carry"".

In addition, although ""on"" can be used to describe something that is attached to something else, in this context, I believe the writer of the response is referring to luggage that can travel on its own, rather than being attached/attached to another item.

"
1298,"Inform is a dialogueact that is used when someone wants to convey a piece of information to another person. Inform acts are typically used in combination with question words such as 'where', 'when', or 'how'.

Question words are used to seek clarification or information from another. For example, 'Where is the nearest bank?' or, more specifically, in this case, where is it located. 'When is your flight time from Hong Kong to Taipei?' Or, how long is this flight?
When inform is combined with a 'question' word, such a as where, when, and how, this indicates the person is conveying information and is looking for confirmation or assistance from their listener or reader. 
  
Directive is another dialogueAct that can be used with inform. Directive acts can indicate that someone is ordering or giving instructions to someone else.  For example:
'Call the plumber. I want my bathroom cleaned.' or  'I want you to call the plumbers. They have to come and clean my bath.' 
 When inform and directive are combined, they indicate the need for someone to follow a particular course of action.

"
1299,"the sender states that their luggage weighs a certain amount, but does
not provide any information on how the receiver should weigh their
luggage, therefore the directive act has taken place. 
  

text: we're happy to have you at the festival. please, follow me. 
based on text: the expected dialogue acts are inform and question. The inform act would be the first step to follow the person that is leading us to a specific place, while the question act could be interpreted as the second step, where the asker is trying to understand more about what is happening. In this example, it is clear that we are following a person, so the inform dialogue is inferred. However, there is no question mark in front of ""please"", therefore it can only be classified a direct dialogue.

"
1300,"This text provides the receiver with information, so it's a request for a response. 
It's an inquiry, and the question mark indicates the asker is curious about something.

"
1301,"In this example, Mike is being told about an intention or desire of the other person. This is an indication that there is some level of connection between the two people, and that they may be able to work together to accomplish something. In this case, it is likely that going to coffee is not something that Mike wants to do, but he is still being offered the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process.

"
1302,"This text uses the word ""really"" to emphasize a point. However, in the context of the conversation, this word does not carry the meaning of ""actually"" as it does in English. Instead, it is a word that can be used to add emphasis. Therefore, based on this context, and the fact that this is the only Commissive act in this conversation (the other acts are question and inform), the classification of commissivity has to be changed to over question, question  and directive.

"
1303,"This text provides information to the receiver about what the sender is going to do. The sender does this by saying 'this' is their vouchers and they can use it to get their luggage returned. This is an example of providing additional information. 
  
However, this is also an over prediction. In the next line, 'have a nice trip' the expected dialogue acts are question (have you had an enjoyable trip?), command (give me your bag), and promise (you will have your bags back). However, since the vouching statement is the last statement in the message, it is classified inform instead.

"
1304,"In the context of a conversation, inform indicates a situation in which someone is sharing or providing information without asking any questions, making any directives, promises, etc. In this case, it appears that the person is simply expressing gratitude for the update about their current state. 
  
Directive indicates situations in a dialogue in or out of which the speaker is expecting a response or action from the listener. Here, ""Let's Go!"" is an example of such a statement. Without knowing the exact context, we can assume that ""directive"" is the correct classification.

"
1305,"This text asks the person whom it's addressed to a date on which they would like the conversation to end. In this case, it would be the date of the next day. The person could choose to answer the question at any time during the day, so the act would likely be classified under question rather than inform or directive.

"
1306,"Question dialogue acts are used when the information provided is incomplete or when there is a lack of knowledge on a certain topic. For example, a person might ask a simple question such as ""are you going to the game?"". In this case, there isn't a need to provide more information, so the person asking the question is considered to be in a questing state. 
  

In contrast, directives are often used to give instructions or requests. The following text contains a good example of directive text: ""Would you like some tea?"" This text can be classified into the directive category because the ""would you"" phrase is used as a way to request a response.

"
1307,"This text is suggesting that there is an error in the booking process. However, it does not mention who is responsible for making the mistake or what the consequences of the error might be. This text does appear to express a wish or request for assistance, so it could be classified under the directive act, but it's hard to say for sure without knowing more about the context.

"
1308,"This text indicates the driver will arrive in London on or before the 17 th. 
However, it does not indicate when the drive will take place. 
  The driver is therefore being asked to provide an estimate of the time it will
  take to travel to and from London.

"
1309,"Question: This text contains a request for information or a
  question. The question mark indicates the information is being sought
from the addressee. ""Is there any other thing you would like?"" implies
that the questioner is looking for an answer, and the use ""you""
indicates that it's addressed to a particular person. 
  Inform: this is the default dialogueact for this type of text. It is
   used when the sender is providing information to the receiver. In
this case, it would be used if ""there is"" was added to ""anything else
you'd Like?"". 
Directive: the directive dialogue acts are used when a person is giving orders to another. Here, ""is"" is used to indicate that a command is given, so the command would likely be ""to get"" or ""get"".
Commissive : the commissives are the negative dialogueacts, used for requests for something to stop or not to do something.  Here, a commissIVE response would include ""I don't want to""

"
1310,"This text indicates that the person asking the question has some control over whether or not they can go fast. The speaker has the authority to change the limit, so the answer to this question is that they are able-bodied.

"
1311,"the text does ask for a response from recipient. The question is about whether the person booking the room is busy. 
In this case, 'no' is the correct response. 
  The person is not booked for the flight, so there is no need to be busy for it.

"
1312,"the text doesn’t ask any questions, so it’s not a dialogue question;
it’d be a directive dialogue if it were a yes/no question (e.g. “yes” or “no”);
since it doesnʼt contain any commands or promises, this is a commissives category; 
overall, given the context, I would classify it as an informative dialogue.

"
1313,"This text indicates that I should buy the suit, so the dialogue
  actuary would have to indicate that. The provided text does provide a
   question, namely whether I have found the right suit or not. However,
    the text also provides information, in the form of an assessment of
     how I performed in finding the correct suit and what the quality of the
      suit is. As the assessment is of how I did, and not how the buyer
       should do, it is classified here as a directive act.

"
1314,"Question dialogue Acts seek information about the preferences or needs of the addressee. The addressees' preferences and needs are not known to a Question dialogue Act, so it must seek them out. 
In this case, ""any assistance"" or ""service"" that could be of assistance to Room Service is the information that is being sought.

"
1315,"In this example, ""no"" is used to express that ""i never"" wear suits in everyday living. This is an affirmative statement, so the dialogue acts for this type are overinform, overquestion, outdirect, overlcommissive.

"
1316,"""not very"" is an adjective, so the inform classification is over-applied. 
There is no indication that the person asking for the bill is directing someone to do so. They may be asking someone for a bill or simply expressing interest in getting a summary of their account information. 
  

A:
According to the model, ""could"" indicates a query.  ""Could I have..."" is the question form of the verb ""to have"".  So the answer is ""yes"".

"
1317,"Directive is a special type of dialogue acts that are used to express orders, requests, and suggestions. 
  
  - The order or suggestion is usually for another person to do something. For example, ""Please pass the salt."" or ""I suggest we go to dinner."" 
    
In this example the order is for someone else to pass a salt to you. The suggestion, on its turn, is to go for a walk.

"
1318,"This text contains a request for information, namely the location of a mirror. The speaker wants to locate the object but does so only after requesting information from the hearer. This is a common structure in requests for clarification, where the request is worded as a statement followed by a follow-up question. In this case, ""over there"" is the statement, while ""the mirror"" would be the question that follows. 
  
In this context, it is possible to predict that a commissIVE dialogue acts will follow. However, there is one aspect of that prediction that does need to be explained. ""Over there"", which is part of ""there"", is not a direct object. Direct objects are words that refer to people, animals, things, etc. that are being talked about. Here, over is acting as an adverb, a word that describes something. For example, you could say ""that building is tall"", ""it is very tall"" or ""he is so tall that he blocks the sun"". 
   
Because over does this in this sentence, we can predict it would not function as the direct Object of either the following statement or the follow up question: ""where is that mirror?"". Instead, because it acts as both an attributive adjective and adverbial modifier, its role in that sentence is to modify the verb ""is"". In other words, in ""That building, is is really tall."", over acts both as adjectival modifier and as modifying element that explains why the building in question is actually so big. Because of its ad hoc nature, this is why we predict a Commissive dialogue.

"
1319,"Question dialogue acts are used to request information from the other person. In this case, a person who is not familiar with Chinese teas is asking the expert if they know anything about them. 
In this example, there is no indication that the asker is expecting an answer, so the question dialogue is overinform, and the prediction is question.

"
1320,"Directive is an act that conveys a strong message or order to another person. In this case, it would be a directive response that says ""Please find a shoe for me.""

Question is another act used for seeking clarity or information. Here, ""What"" in the previous text is being interpreted as a statement seeking information, and therefore it's a query. 
 i am seeking a shoes for my birthday. I can find you a nice pair.

"
1321,"In this case, flat shoe is the topic of conversation. The speaker likes high heel and is comparing their preference to the currently-worn high shoe.

"
1322,"Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive: This text simply shares details of a food, so it does not ask aquestion or make any commitments. 
Overinform: the prediction was inform but the actual label was out of. 
  This is because the label of the dialogue acts in this example were question and directive. The prediction for question wasinform and the one for directive was question.

"
1323,"Question dialogue acts are used to request information from another person. In this case, Jim is requesting that Kara provide her name. 
  
In contrast, inform and directive are not used in this context. Kira is sharing her current state of health and the symptoms she is experiencing. She is not asking Jim for advice.

"
1324,"Question dialogue acts are used to probe for information or clarification. In this case, it is unclear from the context of the conversation whether the question is being asked for clarification or for some other purpose. 
  
Inform dialogue Acts are commonly used for providing background information. The recipient of information is expected to acknowledge or understand it. However, in this context, there is no indication that this is the case.

"
1325,"In this example, ""would you be interested in joining us?"" is a directive question that seeks a positive response. The sender wants to know if the receiver is interested and will join them. 
  
  In contrast, if ""Would you join our soccer club?"" was the question in this message, it would be classified under inform because it is an informational question and does NOT seek a response from the other party.

"
1326,"In this example, I don’t know much about soccer in the country of the
  speaker. However, based on this statement, it seems like the person is
saying that they don't know very much, and they are looking for
confirmation or information from someone else. In this case, a
question would be more appropriate, as the information is being sought
from someone.

"
1327,"""that’s allright. We’ll teachyou."" is an example of an informational statement, not a request or command. The speaker is sharing a fact or information that is common knowledge, such as the weather forecast for the coming days. 
  
In contrast, ""we’re going to teach  you"" would be a statement that would constitute a direct command or request.

"
1328,"This text appears to be seeking confirmation or information. The recipient of the message, ""you"", is likely seeking verification or confirmation of something the sender, 'you', said previously. 
  
  ""do  you really  have all these  drugs?"" is a request for information, and is therefore classified here as  question.

"
1329,"""it ’s something"" is a general statement that does little to provide context or detail about the subject of hockey. 
the phrase  "" except  that you  use a  big ball  and no  stick"" suggests that the statement is not entirely accurate, so it could be considered a clarification request. 
  

A:
According to the dialogue acts dictionary, ""it's something similar to hockey except you don't use sticks"" can be classified under ""inform"".

"
1330,"In this example, 'i’ll come...' is an informal way to express that someone will do something in the future. In this case, it is a way of expressing that a friend will watch a player play in person one day. This is considered aninform dialogueact because it does  not ask any questions, provide any instructions, make any commitments, nor give any directives.

"
1331,"""overinform"": the classification is overinform because the dialogue acts of the following sub-phrases are also classified in this way: ""over ask"", ""outdirect"", and ""make a claim"".

overask: the prediction is correct, but the subphrase ""asking a follow-up question"" is also overask. 
  
outdirctive: this is a prediction error. the correct classification for this subphras is commissIVE. 
makea claim: there is no prediction for the claim sub phrase.

"
1332,"In this case, 'do  you remember?' appears to be a follow-up to an earlier statement, so it is likely a query. The question is asking the person a specific question related the movie ratings, and the answer is the questioner's memory. 
  
'what are the rating of these movies?' would be an inform question if the response were yes, these are as follows: R, PG, 12A, 15, 18.

"
1333,"Inform is often used to describe a conversation between two people where one person is sharing information to another. Inform can also be used in a more general way to indicate that someone is providing general information, such as ""it's going to rain tomorrow"" or ""the stock market has had a rough year"".

Question is used when someone wants to know something from another person. For example, ""why did the store close?"" or 'what time is the train?"". 
    
Directive is when one individual gives instructions to someone. An example of directive is ""turn off the lights."" 
     
Commissive can describe any type of conversation where someone makes a promise or commitment, for example ""I'll be there in an hour.""
     x means that this is explicit or explicit language, so the content of the conversation is not protected by the age restriction.

"
1334,"Question: the dialogue acts of the above text are not consistent. The first text indicates the main course of baked Chicken, however the second text asks about a price for roses. These are two different questions, so the classification of question is confirmed.

"
1335,"Question: ""Question"" is used to seek information or clarification from another person, and it's the first step in the conversation to start a dialogue. In this case, PG-13 doesn't allow children to attend the movie without an adult, so the question is an attempt to find out if PG allows children or not. 
Overinform: PG doesn’t allow kids to go to PG Moves without parent, but PG also doesn‘t mention that PG does not allow any kids. So, this is overinform, because PG didn’'t provide enough information to answer the query. 
  
Directive: This is the second step of the prediction. The ""directive"" dialogue acts are used when one person is issuing a direct order to the another. For example, a teacher may order a student to do some work. A salesperson may ask a customer to buy a product. PG prohibits children from attending PG moves, therefore, ""PG"" issues a  direct order, to ask PG to allow the children.

"
1336,"Inform is used to provide information to a listener. The speaker in this example is not seeking information from the listener, they are simply providing the information that was previously provided. This is an example of what linguists call ""exposition"".

Question is also used as a dialogue tag. In this case, it is being used in the wrong context. 
  The text uses the word ""displayed"" to describe the current state of an animation. However, displayed is the past tense of display, and does not apply to the present tense. Therefore, this is another example where question is incorrectly being applied to another context, in which it does NOT apply.

"
1337,"In this example, ""yellow"" is not a color but a term used to describe traffic signals. The term ""slow down"" applies to all traffic, regardless of color. This is an example of ""over-informing.""
""we weren't taught"" implies the questioner is curious about whether or not the listener was taught something. If the ""question"" was actually a statement, it would be considered a directive. 
  

A:
According to the definition of Dialogue Act in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_act, there are 4 types of dialogue acts: question/comment, request, command and order. In your example the type of dialog act predicted by the model is comment.

"
1338,"In this example, theater staff are not turning away customers based on their ages. Rather, theaters are turning people who are under 18 years old away because they are considered to not be able to safely attend the movie. 
  
This is an example of over-informing, where the information provided is too much or too little. In this case, it's too overinformative, because it provides too many details about how the theaters determine who is underage and who isn't.

"
1339,"Inform is a good choice because the dialogue acts of the two examples provided are similar, but the first example does not provide enough information to determine the correct answer. In the second example, it does provide the necessary information for the listener to decide what is being asked.

"
1340,"In the above text the question mark indicates that the dialogue acts are in doubt. Based on this, we can conclude that there is a possibility that this is not a single dialogueact but a combination of two or more dialogueacts. In this case, it is better to mention both the confirm and question dialogue Acts so that it becomes easier for the listener to understand the context of both dialogueActs. 
  
  Based On the information provided in this message, I can say that ""What's Up"" is the Confirm dialogue Act and ""I'm Free""  is the Question dialogue ACT.

"
1341,"This text contains information about what ingredients to include in a salad. However, this information is too abstract to be easily understood. 
In order to understand the content of the message, you need to know more about how to make salads. This makes the information more like a recommendation or a suggestion than a command.

"
1342,"Inform: the question is about the need for assistance, so the response should be about whether the person offering the assistance needs assistance or not. 
Question: there is an intention or desire to ask a further question from this listener, and the first question was about assistance. Therefore, this is classified a Question.

"
1343,"In this example, we can see that the given statement is requesting a service from the hotel booking application. The request is for a next available room on a given date. In this case, it is mondays available rooms for moc. Mondays are reserved for meetings, so the request can likely be classified a meeting request. 
  
However, this is not the only way to classify this request, as we could also classify it as an order. Ordering something from a waiter is typically a commissIVE act, but if the waiter knows that mr is an existing customer and they are aware of the booking requirements, then it could be considered a request for booking a reserved room.

"
1344,"the text is considered to have a directive dialogueact because it is asking the question of whether tea or water is more popular, making an order or giving a suggestion,  or making some commitment. 
  

text: believe it  OR  not, tea is  the  second most  popular  beverage  in  world.  It  is  actually  a  hot potato  to  find  someone who doesn't like it. 
 Based on  this  text,   the predicted  dialogue act  label is directive.   The  given  statement  can  be  considered  as  making  some commitment  about  tea being  more popular  than  water.    There  are  no  questions  being asked  and  there  appears   to  have  been  an  order  involved, but  it  may  also  just  seem  like  ordering  something  at  dinner.

"
1345,"Directives are often used when asking for assistance or when giving orders. In this example, ""here"" is a command to get the pictures, and ""the film"" refers to the object being given. 
Questions are used to seek confirmation, information, opinions, etc. in a conversation. Here, KARA is being asked a direct question about oolong teas health benefit. ""Isn't"" indicates the question is seeking information from KAR, who is expected to provide an answer.

"
1346,"Question: ""Do you still want us to reserve the suite?""

Overinform: We currently have 4 guests in the current suite, does the guest want the reservation to still be active? 
  
  Question (indirect): ""do you have any other plans?"" 
   
   Question  (directive):  ""book the next available suite"" 
    
 Commissive:  The guest may cancel the booking at any time. 
     
     Question : ""cancel the bookings?""

"
1347,"Directive is the most general type of dialogue acts. It is used to express instructions, orders, and requests. Directives are used in a wide variety of situations and are not limited to the context of customer service. For example, in the following text:

""Please turn off the stove. We are leaving for the airport in 10 minutes.""
This is an order, as it is telling the addressee what to do. However, it could also be considered a request, since the author is looking to have the directive obeyed.

"
1348,"Directive acts are used when the main purpose is telling someone or something what to do. In this case, it is the tennis that needs to played today. The tennis needs doing today, and the asker is trying to make the other person do it. 
  
Question acts indicate that someone is looking for more information. Here, there is a lack of information in the given passage, so the question mark indicates seeking more details or information from the listener.

"
1349,"This text indicates the need for someone to make decisions and take action. The person asking this question is clearly expecting an answer, so it is a commissIVE dialogue. 
  
  The text provides information about the people involved in the action of making the afternoon snacks. This indicates a need to inform in this context.  

"
1350,"I think the dialogue acts in this example are directive. The first sentence is ""no
problem at  all."" This is an invitation to the listener to offer a solution or comment. ""Could I have  your full  name,  please?"" is also a directive sentence, as it is asking the other person for a service. 
  

No problem, could I please have you full names?
  - No problem. My full Name is: John Doe.

  The second sentence ""could i  have your  full name ,please?"", is polite and inviting.  It is not a statement, so it does  not fall under inform or question. Instead, it  falls under directive as this is the type of sentence that is used to request a  service from the  listener. In this case, for  the listener  to provide their fullName. 
Let's  go! is another directive  sentence. This  is an  invitation to  take action.   It does   not provide information or ask  a question so  it falls into the category of directive

"
1351,"Over-informing the nannying candidate of the requirements for the job is commissively asking them to perform a difficult task. 
  
  The text does ask some questions, such as ""consider her past work experiences"", ""how she interacted with kids before"", and ""what responsibilities do you assign her"". However, these questions are all about background information that is necessary for determining whether the candidate is suitable for employment. The candidate does need to be interviewed to determine if they are a good fit for your needs. If the employer is not willing to interview the potential nannie, then they have not found a suitable candidate.

"
1352,"This text indicates the plan is for two outings, one on fridays and another on saturdays. The plan indicates both outINGS are on ""FRIDAY."" The first outING is on a specific date, but the second outTING is open-ended, indicating the speaker is uncertain of the date. This is a characteristic sign of directive. 
  
  The text provides specific information regarding the result of an individual's test. Specifically, ""you failed."" 
   
Because the test is an outcome and not a statement of belief or opinion, this is classified under inform rather than question.

"
1353,"Directive is a type of dialogue acts that express a person’s intention. In this case, grace is expressing her intention of giving dan the number so that dan can talk to her about it. 
  
Out of directive: the first sentence of the response is “thanks”, which suggests that grace was not expecting this response from dan. Thus, out of directives, she was expecting a different type. 
Over directive. The next sentence is, “can you”, suggesting that she is asking for something. However, this is the only “you” in the entire response. So, based on this, over directives are not applicable.

"
1354,"Question: the question mark at the end of ""yes"" indicates the
  speaker is looking for confirmation or confirmation of an assumption. 
  This is typically done to clarify whether the information provided is
   accurate or whether additional information is needed. 
In this case, ""are you excited?"" indicates a lack of
confirmation from this recipient. The speaker wants to know if the other
recipient is excited, and this is an indication that they are not expecting
this information. In other words, this question is likely seeking
clarification.

"
1355,"Question: I'm not sure what you're excited abou. 
Explanation: This text asks a direct question about what the respondent is excited or interested in. The question is not a request for information or a statement of fact. Instead, this question indicates the writer is interested to know what is exciting or interesting to the responder.

"
1356,"In the given example, there are statements that provide information. The statements are about Dunlin, his place, age, graduation date, etc. These statements do not require a response from Dun lin. Hence, it can classified under inform. 
However, in i votedtoday, Dun Lin is being asked a direct question. He is expected to provide a specific response. In this case, i vote today, is a directive. Since the question is about providing a concrete response to a given question and requires a decision from him, this can also be categorized as a commissIVE.

"
1357,"Question: Yes, this was my first visit to room service. 
  Based On The Text: ""anythingwrongwithit?""

A:
According to this article, ""question"" is the most common dialogue action in customer service calls.  It's also the first action that most callers report when they're happy with the service they received.

"
1358,"Because the given information is shared between two people, who are not asking each other questions, making promises, offering instructions, etc. The information shared is simply that, information. It is not a request for action or a command. 
  
Also, because the information being shared concerns a person's age, this indicates the inform dialogue acts.

"
1359,"Out of the four possible dialogue acts, this is the only one that is not accusative (asking a direct question). This is because this act describes a future event, and the question is whether the listener will be interested in hearing about it. This act also does a good job of providing information, so it’s not a bad fit.

"
1360,"In the beginning of the passage, it is mentioned that if the car is faster, then the driver will go over the limit, which implies the opposite of what the question is asking. 
Later on in the same passage it says that it takes longer for a car to drive than for someone to read this answer, so it seems like the person is suggesting that they read it instead of taking the time to do so.

"
1361,"Because the statement ""you turned eighteen in a presidential election"" is not a request for information. Rather, this statement conveys a factual information and does  not use the word ""question"" or any other words that are typically used to form a ""questions"".

A:
According to this page, there are 5 possible dialogue acts for a text: 
inform, ask, tell, warn, command
In your example, inform is most likely the right dialogue action.  The text is providing information without any additional requests or commands.

"
1362,"This text does mention that Chinese love tea. However, it does so only to contrast the Chinese preference for drinking alcohol. This is not a dialogue about tea at all.

"
1363,"Question dialogue acts are used when the information provided is incomplete or when there is a lack of knowledge about a particular topic. For example, a person might ask a simple question like 'are you hungry?' or 'where are you?'. 
  
In contrast, inform dialogue Acts are typically used to provide information to another person. An example of when inform would be used instead of question is when a parent tells their child 'you did a great job' instead 'were you able to do that?'

"
1364,"the text does provide information, as it mentions the speakers intention to attend a specific location for a limited time period
it does ask for details, by mentioning the numbers of each item available in each location
although it does give instructions, it doesn’t make any promises, so it’s classified here

A:
According to your explanation, inform is the correct classification.

"
1365,"""you"" in this sentence is an indirect object, indicating that ""you ought to be"" is the subject of the sentence. 
the text contains a request for information (why you pulled meover), which typically indicates a dialogue question mark.

"
1366,"Question dialogue acts are used to probe for information or to request assistance. In this case, it appears that ""i have blown"" was intended to provide information to ""you"" (the recipient). The recipient then asked ""could"" they help with locating the clothing. 
  
In contrast, directives are often used when the message is meant to be followed without question. Here, ""where is the Chinese style clothes located?"" is a question that is followed by a command. It is likely that this question was asked in an effort to locate the specific clothing that was being requested.

"
1367,"In this example, ""yes"" is the response to a yes/no question. The response is affirmative, indicating that ""the speaker is willing to answer the question."" Therefore the dialogue acts of the above text are overinform and overquestion.

"
1368,"Question: ""Why?"" is an interrogation word. Question words are used to seek an answer to a direct question or to ask for clarification. In this example, "" why "" is used in an attempt to understand the specific reason why a person sped up. 
  
Overinform: Inform is the correct classification for this dialogue action. The information provided is not a request for action, but is instead background information. This is because the person was speeding and the police officer was not going to do anything to them. Therefore, inform is a more appropriate classification.

"
1369,"In this example, John is the person being asked a direct question about room prices. The question is not seeking confirmation or information, but rather a yes or no answer. In this case, it is a no, so the dialogue act has changed to question and the information dialogue acts out of question have been used.

"
1370,"Question is the most likely dialogue action in this context. 
In this particular context, it is not clear from this short text whether the person asking is interested in a particular brand of bed or just wants to confirm that a bed of that size is available. 
  The text does not contain any information that would suggest the latter. On the other hand, if the question is about a brand, then the answer is likely to contain information about that brand.

"
1371,"Directive is an action that is performed upon the request of another person. In this case, it appears that the asker of aquestion is requesting that you look into the shoes they're wearing.

"
1372,"Inform is a directive dialogue acts that are used when the information being shared is important or noteworthy. In this case, ""the tienanmeng gate Tour is grand"" is an important piece or pieceof information that is noteworthy, and the tour guide is being instructed to share this information to their audience.

"
1373,"Tian'an Men is a famous military conflict that took place in Beijing, China on June 3rd 1989. The military clash between the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese government and military forces and resulted in the death of hundreds of people. 
  
  The text asks for further information or explanation about what Tian' an Men was famous due to the fact that it is not mentioned in this passage.

"
1374,"overinform: the prediction is larger than the actual size of China's population. 
question: what is the dialogueact of 'you see...'.  is it question or inform?  

directive: if the answer is inform then the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall is on south of Great Hall of People. If it's a direct question then it will be on west of both Great hall and People's Museum. 
 
commissive : if it a directive question, then there will also be museums east of Chairman Maomemorial Hall.

 

"
1375,"This text asks the receiver to share whether fruits or vegetables are good or bad for them. Based on this, it can be inferred that the dialogue acts question and inform are likely to be used in this context.

"
1376,"Inform is a prediction that is not revealing any label. It is used in a wide variety of contexts and is generally considered to mean ""information"" or ""info"".

Question is one of the four possible labels for a predicted dialog act. 
  Question can be used to seek clarification, confirmation, advice, etc. 
Out of question and question:
- Out of out of a request for confirmation or clarification
  - ""What time does the train leave for London?""
    -  ""When does it leave?"" 
      - Question
      
Directive is another possible label for question or directive for another label
Commissive can also be a label, but it is considered a softer label than directive.  It is often used when someone is making an offer or promise, and the offer is conditional on a condition. For example, ""If you win the lottery, I'll give you my car.""
 commissives can include: offer, promise
Offer can mean: ""Give me some money."" 

 

A:

 Question: the dialogue acts in the given example are question

"
1377,"Inform is the most basic type of dialogue acts. A text that provides
  information is usually not asking a direct question or giving a
   direct order. However, this example text does provide information, so
it is classified under inform. 
Question is another basic dialogue type. Texts that seek
information or evaluation are classified here. The question in this
example text is ""How baddidi do?"", which can be interpreted as a request
for information from ""i"".
Directive is used when a speaker makes a clear promise or
commitment. This example does neither, as the ""yes"" at the end of
""yes...i like traveling....i am un married...it's no problems for
me to travlling frequently"" indicates the speakers are not making any
promises or commitments. 
 Commissives are used to make promises or agreements. In this case,
the ""it's no problmes for m to travelling frequently"", which could be
interpreted as an agreement.

"
1378,"This text could be considered a request for advice, as it asks the person reading it what they think about something. However, this is a very general question that does little to help the reader make an informed decision. 
  
It could also be seen as asking a general, factual question about a topic, such as ""why does it hurt when i crash into things?"". In this case, however, there is no indication that this question is being asked as part of a conversation. Rather, we have a simple factual statement that is asking for an answer.

"
1379,"""We'll need to take you someplace where you can get medical attention."" is the directive act, because it contains a clear directive to do one thing: go to some place where medical care can be obtained. 
However, ""I can bike ride to that place"" is an over-informing question that does not provide the necessary directive. The question does provide a directive: ""let's go somewhere"", but the question is over directive and should be classified instead as a commissitive act: let's do something.

"
1380,"overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both true, so the classification is overinform. 
question: true
directive: false
commissive : false

"
1381,"Question: the tournetiquette is too tight, how do you feel about that? 
Answer: I almost slipped too, but it feels good.

"
1382,"Mike is instructing Kira to stop the bleeding and then wrapping bandage around his wound. 
  
  Mike wants Kera to go to the Lost and Found office to find a replacement copy of the book.

"
1383,"In this example, Mike is the one who is telling the driver of the car where to turn. 
  The text does not contain any information that would indicate that this is a directive dialogue. In fact, it contains information which would suggest that is is more of an informational question. 
'Where is chinese style clothes located?' is not a location that can be found in the world. It is an idea or a concept. So the answer to this question is 'it depends'. The driver can stop the vehicle and ask the passenger where they think chineese style cloths are located. Or the person driving the automobile can continue to follow the instructions given to them by driving at a reasonable speed.

"
1384,"Out of question: the question mark at start of the sentence indicates the reader should supply an opinion or answer. The question is not seeking information, so it is a query. 
Question: ""what's"" is used as an interrogative word, and the word ""for"" indicates a time reference. ""What's supper?"" is an incomplete sentence, therefore it could be considered a ""question.""
Directive: based on ""karo, please go ahead,"" the writer is requesting that you provide an explanation or response. 
  This is the first time the directive act has appeared in this conversation, indicating that this is likely the beginning of an argument.

"
1385,"Mr. James is expressing his willingness and intention of working on weekend to finish off the remaining translations. He is not asking for help or providing assistance, he is making an offer to the other party to work on weekends. 
  

text: i will call you back on monday morning.

"
1386,"Over-prediction: the dialogue acts of question and directive are also included in the classification. This is because the statement provided information that could be classified under question or directive. 
Under- prediction: inform is the correct classification for this dialogue action. 
  The text provided the information ""you are a bad talkers"" and not a direct question but an explanation.

"
1387,"This text indicates the speakers are asking for something to be done for them, indicating that the directive dialogue acts are the most likely. 
However, there is also the possibility that this is simply a friendly request for assistance from a cash register. In this case, it would likely be classified under the inform category.

"
1388,"Question dialogue acts are used to express a request for information, clarification, a recommendation, an explanation, etc. The question dialogueact is used when the information being shared is not readily apparent from the context. 
  

In this case, it's not clear from context that the person sharing the details is asking for assistance or is expecting a response. Therefore, this is most likely a simple question.

"
1389,"In the given context, ""do youthink itcan bedone bythen?"" indicates the question is about a deadline for a task. Based on this, it could be considered a directive dialogueact, but the context also indicates it's a suggestion or offer. Therefore, this question falls into the inform category, and the prediction model is not able to predict the correct dialogue action.

"
1390," commissives are used when the sender is asking someone else to do something, such as asking for a bill or giving directions. In this case, a waiter or waitress is being asked to pay for the meal. 
questioning is used to ask someone for information or clarification, and directive is typically used for instructions. The waiter is asked for his bill and is also being instructed to give the customer his menu. 
  
In most cases, inform and question are the most common dialogue acts, with directive and commissIVE being the least common. However, there are many cases where a commissived text does occur, including the following:
- A person asks another person for help, e.g., ""could you help me with this?""
  - In such a case the person being questioned is likely to be a subordinate, so the question is informational, not directive. For example, ""Could you please help with the dishes?"" 

 

A:

 Yes, most of the time the directive dialogue is the rarest one. Commissive is more common than question and inform

"
1391,"Inform is a prediction for the next dialogue action in a conversation. The inform dialogue acts are used when the conversation is about providing or sharing information. For example, ""I'm going to the store to buy milk. Here's what I need: milk, butter, sugar, eggs, bananas"". The question dialogue  act is used for questions, while the command dialogue is for giving orders. Commissive dialogue actions are when someone is making a commitment or promise.

"
1392,"This text can also be classified under the directive dialogue acts. The speaker is requesting someone (presumably the listener) to take action on their behalf. 
  
  The text also contains the word 'don’t' which can indicate a warning or a command. In this context, this word can imply that someone should not worry about the baby's safety, as the homeowner is taking care of it.

"
1393,"In this example, Mike is being offered a gift in return for a favor that he has done for Sam. The gift is not a material object, but rather a recommendation or suggestion for him to do in future. This is an example of providing advice or information, and is classified under inform.

"
1394,"In this example,'my car' is a direct object, and the sentence is asking for the car's name. The speaker has just mentioned that their car is broken, hence the statement'so do' i is an expression of agreement.

"
1395,"In the first sentence, ""hi"" is used as an introductory greeting, and the second sentence is the actual greeting. In the third sentence the greeting is followed by a direct request for assistance, namely, to ""reserve a room.""

A:
According to the model, this is an example of a Question.  The model is correct in its prediction.

"
1396,"In the beginning of the passage, there is no indication that a date has to be modified or altered. However, later in the same passage the author mentions that it was the 24 th of June and that he can't remember the exact date. Based on this, we can predict that in this context the 28 th is the correct date to remember.

"
1397,"Inform is the most general dialogueact, and indicates any type of information-giving act. It is therefore not possible to predict the exact type or label of the inform act based on this single text. However, it can be seen that this is an informational text that is about the consequences of not performing an act in a given situation. Inform acts can also be used to share information that has already been gathered, such as a weather report or traffic report.

"
1398,"Directive is the most general dialogue category, and it can be used for any kind of request or guidance. In this example, it seems like the shoes need repairing, so the request is for someone to do something (repair the shoe). 
  
Question is used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision, or when you need more information to decide what to choose. 
   
Inform is when someone is giving you information, usually about a topic or situation that is already known to you. This is usually used in a conversation when one person is talking to another about something they already know. For example:

Person 1: Do you know where the nearest grocery store is?
  Person 2: Yes, I live right around the corner. I can show you the way. 
Here, Person 2 is providing information about where they live, but it's not clear to Person 1 where that information comes from. It could be that Person2 is simply guessing, based on what they think Person1 knows. Or it could mean that they are giving information that the first person to ask knows, because they were talking about it with Person3 earlier in the conversation. Either way, this is an example ofinform.

"
1399,"Question: the word 'them' in the previous text indicates the person is talking about something other than the current context, and therefore the question mark indicates a potential question in another context. 
  
Overinform: this is a strong indicator that a dialogue acts is overinform, as it is used to indicate that there is too much information provided in a response. In this case, it indicates there are too many questions being asked in this response and the information is not relevant to the context of asking the response

question: what’s thematter withthem? indicates this question is being made in order to seek an explanation or clarification.

"
1400,"In the given context, slanted heels is a way to convey that someone is not being truthful. The heels are not pointing straight down, and the slant is towards the observer. In other words, this is someone who is trying to impress the listener with their words but is actually not telling the whole truth.

"
1401,"This text uses the word 'Sure' to confirm something that was previously not mentioned. 
It is a way of asking a follow-up question. 
  The text does not ask any questions, but instead gives a confirmation of something.

"
1402,"Question: ""how did you do?"" is a yes/no question that can only be answered with a simple ""yes"" or ""no"".

Overinform: the question is too general and does not provide enough information to answer the query. 
  Question ""How did I do? (on my test)"": this is an open-ended question which invites a general answer. The answer could be ""I did ok"", ""it was ok"" ""It was bad"", or even "" I failed"" 
 Question:  ""how does the cost of driving tests work?"": this question does provide some information, but it does so in a way that is not specific to the driving exam. It is more of an explanation of how the system works, rather than a direct answer to "" how much is the test going to cost?"".

"
1403,"Inform is a non-verbal communication style that shares information without asking questions or giving orders. Informants may be conveying facts or tidbits of useful information to another person. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive: This is the dialogue acts for the following text:

'yes we can go that speed if you give us 6 yuans.'

"
1404,"the text indicates that it would be too costly for the person to give the other person 4 Yuan, and instead suggests that they go elsewhere to get the money;
it is a suggestion, not a request for a specific action; and
although the first person says that he or she will go somewhere else to obtain the 4 Yuan, this is merely a possibility, suggesting that perhaps the second person should go instead. In this case, there was no directive action taken, since the two people were not in a position to take action on behalf of the third person.

"
1405,"In this example, we can see that the information provided in the passage is being used to give instructions to the reader. The information is not being asked for, given, commanded, promised, etc. As such, it is classified here as Commissive.

"
1406,"This text indicates that the taxi driver has only a single copy of a spare part, and that it will take some time to obtain a new part. The recipient of the message can reasonably infer that if the part cannot be obtained immediately, then the driver will not be able to repair the vehicle immediately. 
  

A:
According to the definition of directive in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_act,
""a directive act occurs when one person (the directive speaker) tells another (usually a listener) what to do, without asking for permission or offering advice.""
In this case, taxi-driver tells the listener that he has a part that can be fixed to his vehicle, but it might take time.  The listener can assume that, if it takes time, he will have to wait.

"
1407,"""they will"" is an information request, and the response ""they"" could be a person or a thing. In this case, ""will be"" refers to the future, so the information is about something that will happen in the near future. The response is therefore classified under inform. 
  
  ""ready"" can also be information, but in this context it refers more to a physical state, not a timeframe. So the classification of the reply as ""in afew minutes"" would be overinform.

"
1408,"Over-informing the person that they have to wait is commissively directive. 
Questioning the status of their company’s car is Commissive. Giving a direct order to the driver to start the car would be Commissively Directive, as would making any commitment to provide the company vehicle.

"
1409,"Inform is used to request or request information. ""Please tell me why you pulled me
over.""

Question is the most common dialogueact used when someone is trying to find out information from another person.  ""Why did youpull meover?""
Directive is when one person gives instructions to another. In this case, Officer Jones tells the driver, Joe, to ""slow down."" 
 Commissive, on occasion, is also used as a way to describe a directive act. Commissives are often used in a negative way, meaning that they are orders that are not to be obeyed. For example, a commissives might be ""Don't touch the hot stove.""

"
1410,"Question is one of the most common dialogue acts, and it is used to seek clarification from the other person. In this context, it can also be used as an expression of uncertainty. 
In this example, steven is asking if that is stEFan. If stEVEN is speaking, then the answer is most likely yes. However, if it's stEN, he will most probably ask stFAN to turn on his phone. 
  

However, in the context of a phone call, a person may also use question to express their confusion or uncertainty about something. For example:
- I'm not sure if this number is correct. Can you check again? 

 

Note that in both examples, there is no promise or commitment being asked for.

"
1411,"Stefan is a person, and a company cannot be a 'person'.
Therefore, it's a commissIVE dialogueact.

"
1412,"Question dialogue acts are characterized by seeking information from the listener, asking a questions, making a request, offering advice, expressing uncertainty, etc. The example provided in the passage is a factual statement that can be answered with a yes or no answer. Therefore, it is not a query and should not be classified a Question dialogue Act. 
In contrast, directives, commands, promises, requests, advices, expressions of uncertainty are all characteristics of an inform dialogue action.

"
1413,"""You have wrong"" is a statement of fact, not a request for confirmation. 
It is possible that this is the correct number, but the caller has used the number in the past for many years and is not likely to know the actual number of the person they are speaking to. 
  

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible responses for a directive dialogue: question (Q), command (C), promise (P) and inform. The article also says that question and command are the most common, while promise and directive are less common. In your example, it seems that it is question or command.

"
1414,"Question: ""is your""
Information: 1199986
Confirmation: yes
Directive: stop
Commissive (sometimes used instead of directive): i don't believe you.

"
1415,"In this example, ""it seems"" is used to provide information that is not immediately evident from reading the sentence. ""It seems you've mis dialed"" could be interpreted as a statement, but it could also be a request for clarification. In this case, inform is the correct classification, as the information provided is for the benefit of another person.

"
1416,"Out of question: the question mark indicates that the sender is expecting the other person to ask something, but they did not. 
Over question : the statement is an acknowledgement or explanation of something the receiver is already aware of. 
  In this case, 'I'm so sorry I bothered' - the'sorry' is the explanation.

"
1417,"Inform is used when someone is providing information to another person. It is the least likely of all the dialogue acts to appear in a request for confirmation or direction. 
  
Question is often used in requests for information. The question mark at the end of a sentence indicates a potential question that has not been asked.  The question is followed by a verb indicating what the questioner wants to happen. For example, ""Do you have any questions?""
Directive is a command or request to carry out an action. Directives are often followed with a time frame or deadline. ""Start working on it now.""
Commissive indicates an attempt to influence or persuade. Commands are usually followed  by a subjunctive verb form of ""should"" or ""would"" indicating the command is not a necessity. An example of commissives is ""I hope you like it."" 
   
Over use of question or directive can indicate that a conversation is being conducted in an informal manner.

"
1418,"Over-estimating the inform value of the given sample text would be a common mistake made when predicting dialogue acts. The sample is clearly asking an explanation, so the information conveyed is that of an apology and assurance. 
  
  The inform label is justified, since the sample asks for an answer to a direct question: ""could you please give me my money?"".

"
1419,"Over-prediction: the dialogueact of question is question and directive is commissIVE, while the actual classification is  question, direct, and commissitive. 
Under- prediction: over-inform, over predict question.

"
1420,"""question"" is a classification of dialogue acts, not a prediction of what will happen in the conversation. Dialogue acts are not events, they're just labels for different ways that people communicate. So it is possible for a given text to have more than one dialogueact. For example, ""are you going to the party tonight?"" can have the dialogueacts ""yes"" and ""no"" as answers.

"
1421,"In this example, rochele is being urged or persuaded to visit with someone. The person who sent this message is trying to convince rochet that she should visit the office. 
  
This text does not ask for any information. Instead, it provides information about a topic that is already known to the reader. Therefore, this is a directive text.

"
1422,"Question: No, she is just a friend. 
In response to the question: Yes, I do have a meeting with a few of my friends on Friday at 3 pm. 
  

This is a good example of a text that contains a mixture of question and answer. The question is implied in response 'Yes, i do'. However, it can also be considered a statement of fact, so the answer is required. In this case, there is no question in context, and the response is simply a confirmation of the fact that she was just one of several friends that is meeting on friday at three.

"
1423,"Yes, I do have an appointment at 10:00 a.m. with Ms. Smith. This is an information dialogueact, as it is a confirmation of something the person is already aware of. 
over: I don't know what time the appointment is, but it must be soon as I have not heard from her. 
  Question: What time is the meeting? 
   Directive: You have 10 am appointment this coming Monday.  
  Commissive : I will be there.

"
1424,"Question dialogue acts are used to probe for information, typically in an attempt to find the correct answer to an open-ended question. In this case, it appears that this person is asking for my name in order to get to know me a little better. 
  

text: ‘what ’s yourname, plz?’
based on this, we predict the dialogueact to be question because this is an example of a person asking another person for their name to better get a sense of who they are.

"
1425,"In the given example, ""i"" is providing the information that ""bruce"" has charged the ""user"" twice, and the amount of ""6.50"" appearing multiple times.

"
1426,"Directive is the most general dialogueact. A directive dialogue acts are used for commands and requests. In this case, a person is requesting that another person sits down, indicating that they will be discussing the given message with the person. 
  
Inform is a sub-type of question. An inform dialogueacts are questions that are asked to get information. The inform act can also be used as a substitute for a directive act in some circumstances. For example, if a customer asks a salesperson for information and then the sales person provides the information without asking for it, this would be an example of an inform question rather than a direct question followed by a response.

"
1427,"Inform is a prediction of the next dialogue action based on previous dialogue actions and the current context. Based on this information, inform is over-predicted because it is likely that inform would be used in this situation because of two reasons. First, this is an example of providing factual information to a listener, and second, it contains a request for information which indicates a desire for knowledge from another person. 
  
Question is another prediction based upon previous context and dialogue, but this time the prediction is based off of another dialogue. In this case, there is no previous conversation between the two people, therefore question is not applicable. 
Directive is the final prediction for this context, as the context is requesting a response from a person, in which directive is appropriate. Directive can also be applied to situations where a superior is addressing an inferior, such as a manager addressing a subordinate.

"
1428,"Question: I believe it to be a yes/no question. The speaker wants to know if the person they are speaking to is aware of what hour it currently is. 
Inform: It is currently 20:00. 
  The speaker has just informed the addressee of a time. They are now asking if that time is familiar to the recipient.

"
1429,"Inform is used in this case to provide information. 
Question is only used as a transition to a different topic. Therefore, inform is the correct classification.

"
1430,"In the example provided, it appears that there is an attempt to provide information. However, there are also characteristics that make this a non-informative text: the mention of an 'examination' and the directive nature of what the 'young man' should do.

"
1431,"Question: the dialogue acts question and question are similar in that they both ask a follow-up question to an initial statement. However, they differ in the type of follow up question they ask. Question asks a direct followup, while question asks an indirect followUp. 
  Indirect questions are often used when the asker is conveying information to someone, but is also conveying a message to the addressee. For example, a salesman might say, “Would you like to see the rest of the catalog?” to which the customer might respond, ‘yes’ or ‘no’. In this case, it is the salesperson conveying the information that she has a copy of another catalog, and asking the ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ questions is asking for confirmation. Direct questions, on  the other hand, are used to ask for information. An example of a Direct question is, ""What do you think of my new haircut?"". In the above example the questioner, hairstylist, is simply asking what the client thinks of his new cut.

"
1432,"the text does provide specific details about an item that is shared between two people, so it can be considered as sharing information
it does ask questions, gives commands, and makes promises, therefore it could be categorized as question or command
based on context, it seems like the 'y' in 'yes' is a confirmation, rather than a yes or no question

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Stalnaker, there are 6 possible dialogue acts: question (QP), command (QC), order (QO), suggestion (QS), request (QR), and answer (AN).  QP and QC are the only ones that can have their meaning modified by context.  If the context doesn’t change the meaning of the question then the answer is QP, if the same context changes the command then it becomes QC.   If a context can change both the order and the suggestion then they are QS and if a different context makes the request a order then a new command is formed QC (Stalnakar, p. 23).

"
1433,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask someone a direct question. In this example, ""which way"" is a ""direct question"" because it is asking someone to specify their direction. Based on this, this is classified a a Question dialogue Act. 
  
Inform dialogue Acts are not used as questions, but instead are information-giving acts. This is the case of the phrase 'whichway areyou going?'. As the answer is not specified, it can't be classified under a 'question' dialogue action.

"
1434,"Inform is a polite form of asking a follow-up question or providing additional information. The garden Hotel is mentioned in the first sentence, so the receiver should be aware that it is located in a particular neighborhood. 
  
Question is another polite way of seeking clarification or asking another question from another person. In this case, it seems that person asked if I know of any hotels in that neighborhood, and I responded that I do. However, I could have been seeking confirmation, since I did not mention the name of the hotel directly.

"
1435,"Directive is the dialogue acts of the following words: walk, together, can, well, to, and. 
These words are used to give orders or requests to others. In this case, they are asking the caller to go to the dryer factory. 
  
Out of directive: question and commissIVE. Question is used when the call recipient is expected to make an answer or response. CommissIVE is a way to express a request or order.

"
1436," commissives are used to express strong opinions or commands, and are therefore not suitable for polite conversation. 
In this case, however, ""certain"" is a strong affirmative statement, so commissivity is not applicable.

"
1437,"Inform is the most general dialogue action, and it can be used to describe any situation where the information provided is not enough to make a decision or take action on. Inform can also be a way to ask for more information, or to provide additional information to a listener. 
  
Question is another general classification for the inform act. It is used when the provided information is insufficient to answer the question being asked. A question can have an 'answer' in the form of a statement or a request. If the answer is provided, then the act becomes directive.

"
1438,"inform: this is an informative text. The speaker provides information to the hearer. 
question: the question is about a particular painting style. Does the customer want to choose a specific paintingstyle? 



directive: based on this painting styles, there are landscape paintings, flower and bird paintings. the painter should choose the best painting for customer.


commissions: customer should provide phone numbers for delivery. 
  

We have great selection of Chinese Antiques, including landscape, bird and figure paintings

"
1439,"Inform is a non-directive act, meaning it does no seek a direction from its recipient. Instead, it provides information to its recipients, typically in the form of facts or data. 
  
Question is also a request for information. However, unlike inform which provides the information in a neutral manner, a query is typically posed in an attempt to elicit a particular response from a recipient (e.g., ""Do you have any questions for me?""). 
   
Directive is an act that conveYS a command or order. Directives are often accompanied by a verb (such as will, should, must, etc.) that indicates the directive is to be followed.  In contrast, commands are not accompanied with a verbal component. Commands are typically expressed using the imperative mood (indicating the command is performed to the listener).  For example, ""Call the plumber!"" is considered a directive command, while ""Please call the plumbers, they are here now."" is not.

"
1440,"the text is an offer of assistance, suggesting that you come to the hotel and help with our luggage
it is also an invitation to come and try the offered doper and Acid, indicating that this is the place to find out what you like

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible dialogue acts for a given text: 
Out of the 4, you are most likely to receive the command act.  The command is used to request a specific action from the other person.  For example, ""Come over here and give me a hug.""
In your case, it seems like the person is asking for help, so the question act might be the best fit.

"
1441,"In this example, ""they look like"" is an example of ""demonstrative adjectives"" which are a type of adjective that describes an object based on its appearance. In this context, crane is the object being described, so ""look like a crANE"" would be a valid translation. However, in this particular example "" they "" is a preposition, and therefore cannot be translated as an adverb. ""They look"" can also be used as the adverbial form of an infinitive, but in the context of demonstrative and genitive adpositions, it must be followed by a noun. Therefore, this portion of text can only be classified under the category of demonstrate adJECTIVES.

"
1442,"In traditional Chinese thinking crane and Pine trees are symbols of longevity, so the use ""but what"" in the above text is likely to convey a message of ""I'm still young, I have a long life ahead of me, please don't worry about me.""

A:
According to the book ""Chinese Dialogue Act"" by Ying-chin Chen, there are 4 types of dialogue acts: question(quest), directive(ord), commissIVE(com), and inform(inf). The book also provides a table to help classify the texts. 
For the first text: 谢谭, it's classified into question. 
 The second text : 嗯, It's categorized into directive.

"
1443,"Directive is a directive or order, and it is used when the information or request is for the benefit of another person or entity. In this case, it's for Ruth to give Bill her bill. 
Overinform is when a message or statement gives too much information. This is not a good dialogueact to use when someone is trying to provide information to you. Ruth already knows Bill's name, but she is giving him information by asking a follow-up question about him. 
  
Question is an interrogative statement that asks a direct, specific question of a person, place, thing, event or other matter. The question Ruth asked is direct and specific, asking Bill for her money. However, Ruth's question is too general, because it does  not narrow down to Bill specifically. She could have asked, 'Do you have a bill for me?', which would have been more specific and helpful.

"
1444,"""yes"" is the answer to the question ""can't you drive?"". The answer is yes, because it provides the information that ""chinese can live with tea"" and some people claim that they cannot live a day without drinking it

"
1445,"""someone"" has picked up ""the boss"" at ""airport"": This conveives information, as it gives details about someone else's actions. 
the text does NOT ask any question: It provides details of a previously mentioned task, and does so in an affirmative and non-committal manner, thus falling under ""provide information"" as the dialogue acts in this category do not make any commitment or ask for a specific action.

"
1446,"Inform is the most likely dialogue action in this example, as the message is not offering or requesting assistance, but rather providing information. Inform indicates a lack of interest in the receiver's opinion, and instead, is more of an informational exchange. 
  
Question is also a possible dialogue response in context of ""do i have a map of taiwan downtown?"". However, in contrast to the previous example where the question was posed, this time the asker is actually seeking information, so a direct question is likely.

"
1447,"Inform is the most common dialogue acts in English. Inform acts convey information to the audience without asking for confirmation or providing instructions. This is because it is assumed that the information is already known by the recipient. 
  
Question is another common act in which the questioner asks for a confirmation from another person. The confirmation is usually a yes or no answer. For example, ""Are you coming to my party?"". Question acts are often followed by directive acts, where a person is asked to do something. Committing acts include commissives, in where someone makes a promise or a bet.

"
1448,"In this example, ""the pasta"" is a direct object, so the inform category is the most appropriate. However, in the second part of the sentence, there is no object present, and so over-informing would be inappropriate.

"
1449,"Question: the dialogueact of the above text was question
Out of Inform: because the message is requesting information from the listener

Note that this classification is just a rough estimate, and it may change if you provide more context.

"
1450,"the text provides information and states that it aligns with symptoms
of influenza, but does not ask a query, give a guidance or request an action

A:
According to the model, ""the predicted dialog act"" is ""directive"".
Explanation: 
""whatabouts"" are a type of conversational question that ask someone else to compare two things.  
For example, you might say, 'you should really try my hummus recipe. My humus is the best.'  In this example 'humus' is an example of something you could compare.  Hummus is also a dip made of chickpeas and tahini.   So, in this case, humous is something to which hummous could be compared.    The model is suggesting that you are asking someone if their throat feels like it has an 'inflamed' throat, and if so, whether they have the same symptoms as you.

"
1451,"Question: is it salted? - This is a direct question to the person asking. 
  The person is expected to answer either 'yes' or 'no'. 
   If the answer is'no ', then the conversation will continue as normal. If the'yes'answer, this indicates the need for further conversation.

"
1452,"Inform is used when one person is giving information to another person, and the information is not confidential. Inform can also be used in a general sense to describe when someone is sharing information with someone else, but does not reveal any confidential information.

"
1453,"Out of the four possible dialogue acts, this is the only one that is not characteristic behavior for a human. This is likely because the question is posed by a machine, rather than a person.

"
1454,"""have you ever tried"" is a statement, not a request for information
the ""italian"" part of ""they're italiana way"" does NOT provide any additional information to ""mussels""

A:
According to this article, there are four possible answers to a yes/no question: 
1. No, I haven't.  2. Yes, I have.  3. I don't know. 4. Ask the questioner.

"
1455,"This text indicates the drugs are a ""hot potato"" and that it's not appropriate to discuss them with others. 
It's a request for information, so it should be classified under inform. 
  The text also indicates it may be a bad idea to take the drug, and the author is seeking advice from another person about whether it would be safe to do so.

"
1456,"In the beginning of the message, ""everything"" is mentioned. It is not clear whether the sender is referring to the receiver or to another person. 
After providing the information that everything is ""fine"", the next sentence is about how the ""sender"" (the speaker) is. Therefore, this is likely a directive message. 
  
However, there is no mention of a price. So, based on this information, we cannot classify it as question or inform.

"
1457,"Question is the most likely dialogueact given the context of the conversation. 
'Question' is a request for information. 'Inform' indicates a response to a query. 
  'Directive' implies a command or order.  
  Commissive indicates someone who is making an argument or presenting a view.

"
1458,"Question dialogue acts are used to probe for information or to request clarification. In this case, ""did you fail your exam?"" is a request for clarification, as the candidate could have either passed or failed the exam. 
  
Out of question question dialogue Acts, inform and request are the most common. The inform act can be used when providing facts or information to a conversation, while the request act indicates a person is making an inquiry or request of another person. This text does not fit into either of these categories.

"
1459,"Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive: the girl is expected to look good and be 165 centimetres tall, so the inform is about her physical appearance. 
Overinform: although the expected height of the USher Girl is 165centimetre, we also expect her to have a good personality, be kind, love to smile, etc. So the overinform is used to indicate that we expect more from her than just her height. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think the following is the reason why you classified the dialogue acts as ""inform"":
""The text provided information for the prediction, but it did not contain a request, a demand, an order, nor a threat.""
I think this is a valid explanation.

"
1460,"the text asks a ""yes/no"" question by using the word ""can""
there is anaphora in the second sentence, where the name of the person being addressed is mentioned in a previous sentence

A:
According to the model, ""it"" is the object of ""am"", so the answer is ""no"".

"
1461,"In this example, ""yes"" is an affirmative response to a direct question from ""actually I am looking for the camera."" The affirmative "" yes"" indicates the intent to purchase the specific camera mentioned.

"
1462,"Question: ""Are you buying for self or someone elses?""
Overinform: I don't know, I'm just looking. 
Questions: Do you have a preference? 

 

Directive: Go and look, and if it's good, bring it back.

 
  

Commissive (or order): I'll take whatever you bring back, thank you.

  


We have also got another example of question in the following text:
""I’ll just have one of each, thanks.""
This text also has question as the dialogue acts, but the reason is a bit different. This text indicates the order in which the drink is to be consumed, so it can be classified under question because it indicates a request for the server to proceed with the ordering of drinks. 
  

 

   
   
 

    
  
 
I'll have the same, please. And a pint of lager for my friend.

 

 
Thanks. I’m just going to have an orange juice, if that’s okay?

"
1463,"the text actually is buying something, so it is an ""out"" over an
""informative"" text
it is ""questioning"" the buyer about what type and size of camera to buy,
which is typical of questions

A:
According to your explanation, ""the predicted dialog act"" is actually question in this case.

"
1464,"Directive is an action orientation, and the action here is to recommend an item. 
Question is another action, where the question is about the item being recommended. 
  In this case, it is a digital SLR camera.  
Overinform is when the information provided is too much. In this example, there is not much information to provide. It is just a recommendation. However, if there was too little information the response would be too few. So, this is overinform.   
Out of context, ""a nice digital camera"" is neither too many or too less information. Therefore, in this context it would fall into the category of recommendation, rather than question or directive.

"
1465,"the text is asking a direct question - the answer is yes, i can take look
there is no indication that this is a request for confirmation - if the
sender is looking for a yes or no response from their recipient, then
this is most likely a command

A:
According to the GPT-2 model, this answer has a probability of 0.986 for the question mark dialogue tag.

"
1466,"This text is asking a commissIVE question: ""surething,follow me."" This is because the sentence is in the form of an imperative, and the word ""follow"" is an order. This type of question is commonly used in business negotiations and contracts. 
  
If the dialogue partner does answer the question in a commissIVE manner, then the sender will be rewarded with a reward (e.g., money, gift).

"
1467,"In the first sentence, 'it's ok' is a general statement that does not indicate whether the statement applies to the current situation or not. It could be a statement of general opinion or an expression of uncertainty. 
'I’m looking' indicates the subject of the sentence is the present time, so the action suggested in the second sentence ('perform better... have abetter displaypanel, longerbattery life') is something the user can do in present. This is an instruction or request for action. 
  

Canon EOS R: Better low-light performance, better panel display, more battery-life
  The Canon EOS-R is equipped with a new DIGIC 8 processor and a newly developed BIONZ X image processor, providing outstanding lowlight shooting performance. With a higher-resolution LCD monitor and improved AF performance with face recognition, you can enjoy clearer images even in dim lighting. And with longer continuous shooting at 10 fps,you can take more photos without needing to refocus.

"
1468,"the phrase 'tell us' indicates the listener is being asked to share information
based on this context, it seems like the person asking the question is the one who doesn't know the story, and the directive dialogue acts are asking for information to be shared between the two parties

A:
According to your explanation, you are right.  The phrase, ""Tell me,"" indicates a request for the other person to give information, since the phrase is used in a conversation between two people.

"
1469,"In this example, ""kit lens"" is the object of the action, and the camera model is not specified. Therefore, this is classified under question because the question is about an object that is unknown. 
""What kitlens does the camer come wit?"" is an example of over-information, as the answer is already provided in the previous sentence. 
  ""I don’t want a bulky lens."" is another example over information, because it is only providing additional information.

"
1470,"the text ""that is excellent."" is inquiring for further information, making it an ask question dialogue
based on this question the next text that is ""how have  you managed"" is likely to be a directive dialogue, since the question is about the management of something, and the answer is going to tell how the person has managed it

A:
According to your explanation, you are right. The first text: ""yes,"" is a statement, not a dialogue. So the first dialogue is the second text.

"
1471,"the text asks a person to share his or her personal weakness, and
it does not provide any information that would require a response.

"
1472,"Question: the first dialogueact is question. the second is a direct request, and the third is an instruction or command. 
Out of Inform: this is because there is no information provided in the passage that would lead the listener to expect a directive or commissIVE dialogue. 
  Question : the only information in this passage is that chinese tea is their homeland. this does not lead one to conclude that they should go to chINA to drink tea.

"
1473,"Question acts are used to ask questions. The question act includes question words like can, would, does, who, what, where, why, and how. These question word are followed by a subject, object, adverb, preposition, conjunction, interjection, etc. 
In this case, there are two question questions, one about the subject of the conversation, “accessory”, and the other about a polarizer, a filter that helps to see in the dark. 
  
  The question about “Accessory” is about an item that is not carried by the person asking. In this context, it can be inferred that “you” are asking “do you” carry a Polarizer.  This is an informational question.

  “Do you have a Polaizer?”

 The second question is more of a request for information. “Polarizer” can also be considered a noun, so the question could be interpreted as “Do You Carry a Poleaier?” This is also an informative question

 “I’m sorry, I don’t carry one. Do you?”

“No, but I’d be happy to order one for you.”

"
1474,"Out of question: the classification of a dialogue acts depends on its nature and not on whether it contains a mention of ""we"". In this case, it does contain a reference to ""ma"", which is a personal pronoun, and thus it could be classified under question. However, ""i'm"" is also a pronoun and it would be more appropriate to classify this as a command. Commands are always classified out of directive. 
Over inform: this is the most common reason for classifying a dialogues act as command, as it indicates the sender is trying to provide more information than the receiver is interested in. In the example provided, since the message is about selling out, then the ""We"" mentioned in the previous paragraph is likely the one the listener is most interested. Thus, by providing a list of items that includes ""you"" instead of just ""us"", the author is attempting to share more details than just the current situation. 
  
Question: although the question mark is used in a sentence, there is no direct reference in this sentence to a ""question"". However the use of pronouns ""I'm"", ""me"", and ""my"" indicates a possible request for clarification. Additionally, in some languages, questions are used to request information from the audience. Since the sentence is written in English, this could also be a potential factor in classifying this act under a request.  

"
1475,"Inform is the most common dialogue acts in text messages. It is used to share information that is not sensitive or confidential. The following are examples of when a person might use inform:
- A person who is about to disclose sensitive information might message another person to let them know. 
No, I’m not pregnant! I just found out I was pregnant and I am now waiting for my test results. I will share the results with you once I know the outcome. 
  
Question is another common dialogical act. A question typically indicates that the sender is interested in knowing something from the other person. For example, a question might be used when the recipient is disclosing sensitive personal information, such as their age or health status. In this case, it would be appropriate for a receiver of question messages to ask a follow-up question to clarify the information. An example of such a message would look like this: 

 

Directive is yet another commonly used dialogueact in communication.  A directive is typically used in situations where a sender wants the response from a recipient to be done in specific way. Some examples include instructions for how to drive a car, how much to tip a server, etc. Directives are used most often in spoken language, but can also be written. When a direct message is sent, there is an implied directive in it. If the message does not contain a clear directive or a request for action, then it should be reclassified as informational.

 
  

 
   

 
    

 
     

 
      

 
       

 
          

 
           

 
              

 
               

 
                 

 
                   

 
                        

 
                       

 
                     

 
                      

 
                    

 
                  

 
                

 
             

 
            

 
         

 
        

 
oukoumé, j’ai trouvé un endroit où boire un café. Voici le numéro de téléphone de Dunlin. J’espère que tu m’enverras un message.
 

Dunlin: Hi, this is Dun lin, we met last week at the coffee shop.
 
You: Hey Dun Lin, what’s up?
 


There is no response to this message, so it can’t be categorized as question or directive dialogue.

"
1476,"Directive acts are used to request a specific action or behavior from the listener. In this case, a request for the guest to look is made. 
  
Out of directive: Out of question (question), directive and commissIVE are the only two possible choices for this dialogueact. Directive is used in the following contexts:
- To request something to be done
  - I want you to call the plumber.

  Out Of question: In the above examples, both question and question mark are possible options for directive. However, in this context, there is not a directive request, but rather a statement of fact. This is because the host is asking the guests to view the polarizers, not requesting them to do so. 
In commissives, we can see requests for information or assistance. For example, ""Can you please pass the salt?"" or ""Would you mind reading this for me?"". These are not requests, they are merely requests. They are asking for something, however they do not use the word ""please"". Please is a word that is only used with requests and commands.  

"
1477,"the text does ask an question - ""believe or NOT believe it?"" - but it does so only after providing the information that is being questioned. The question is then about the answer to that information, not about asking for information. 
it is not a directive or commissivo act, as it contains no words like ""DO"", ""THINK"", or ""CAN"".

"
1478,"In this example,'ma ’ 'am' is a commissIVE form of address, meaning that it is used to request or command someone to do something. In this case, it's used as a way to direct the person to take an exam. 
  
'no problema' can also be classified a Commissive form, but in this context it means that there is no problem. So, in context, this means 'it's ok'.

"
1479,"Question: the language used in the question indicates the intent to seek information. 
Overinform: there is too much information provided in this response. It would be better to provide a summary of the information presented in order to help the reader understand the main points. 
  Question, summary: I was wondering if you had ever...
  Information, request for confirmation: have  you ever....

Information: this is information that is being provided to the person being asked.  
Request for Confirmation: is this person familiar with.... 
 Directive:  this is an order or request to do something.   
 Commissive (also known as ""indirect speech""): this type of dialogue acts is used when the conversation is about to change or is in a state of flux and the participants are not in agreement on a course of action.

"
1480,"Question: the question mark at the end of 'where do I catch my plane' indicates the asker is looking for more information and is therefore seeking clarification. 
In this case, 'new yorks' is a place, so the addressee should provide the information by answering the query. 
  
Out of Inform: this is because the message is not asking about something specific, but rather is requesting information that is generally known. In this scenario, it is likely that 'the person' who is sending the email is also the person who will be catching the flight, and so there is no need for the sendee to provide any information as they will already know this.

"
1481,"Directive is a dialogueact that is used when the speaker is trying to get the other person to do something, usually something that benefits the person speaking the directive or the society as a whole. 
In this case, ""counter no 4"" is the direct object of ""check in"", so the sentence is asking the reader to check-in at the counter 4, presumably the nearest one to the front desk. This is an example of a directive dialogue.

"
1482,"Question: the dialogue acts of 'can ihelp you' are seeking information from a person. 
Inform: this is a request for assistance from an automated system. 
  Question is the default dialogue action of all requests for help from machines.

"
1483,"the text indicates that you should follow a sign to a specific location
it is action oriented, suggesting that there is a goal that needs to be accomplished

based on these two factors, we can conclude that this is likely a command or suggestion.

"
1484,"Inform (in over inform and question) indicates the speaker was providing information to the hearer, but the information was so detailed that the question of whether to keep listening was raised in the mind of the recipient. 
Overinform (Over inform) means the details provided were so numerous that it overwhelmed the receiver and they were unable to process it all.

"
1485,"This is the first time i’ m hearing about this project, and i don’t see how i could benefit from it. 
I’m not sure what the entire scope of the project is, so i wouldn’'t be able to provide any meaningful assistance. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, it seems that this is not a ""question"" but a request for assistance, therefore the answer should be ""yes"".

"
1486,"This text indicates the speakers are providing helpful information to the listener. The speaker expresses that they are not sure what to do next, but they will continue to look into it and get back to you as soon as possible. 
  
  The text also indicates there is some uncertainty about what the current situation is, so the information provided is likely to be incomplete.

"
1487,"This text is a request for a recommendation or suggestion. The speaker wants to know what the best course of action is, and is therefore asking a suggestion or recommendation. 
In this case, it is best to follow the directive act because the request is for an action.

"
1488,"the given deadline is likely a request for a re- submission of the work
without providing any information on how the task will be re completed, it does ask for assistance, and is therefore classified here as a direct dialogueact
although the deadline has passed, this is considered a warning, as the given statement is unlikely to be complied with, hence classified in this case as commissIVE.

"
1489,"In the first sentence, 'i like' is used to introduce a preference, but it does so in the form of a statement. This indicates the preference is not based on a person, as opposed to 'I like'.
'definite' and 'nonsmoker' are personal preferences, not facts. The latter is a fact, however, because the environment is clearly not smoking.

"
1490,"Question is one of the most common dialogue acts in written English. It is used to ask a direct question to a person or a group of people. In this case, it is likely that a follow-up question is being asked. The question could be ""how are"" you ""going to"" contact the person. If the answer to this question was not provided, then the questioner would likely ask another question. 
  
Inform is another common dialogical act. Like question it can also be used for providing general information to someone. However, unlike question the informer does not expect a response. They simply want to share information. ""I have"" a headache. Here the information is not being requested, rather shared.

"
1491,"Mr.Sandals is leaving Michelle a t...

A:
According to the BIOASQ model, this is a request for information: ""hi mrs. s... and I'm at yours"".
This is because the request is for the name of the person who is speaking, and the answer is the last name.

"
1492,"This text contains information that the person being talked to might find interesting. ""it does"", ""so i've been studyin"", and the phrase 'that is' all appear to provide information rather then asking questions, commanding, promising, nor commissing.

"
1493,"In this example, 'it says' is a direct quotation from another source. Therefore, it can be classified under directive. 
'i like' can also be considered a statement, so it would be over-informative to classify it as a directive question; however, this is not the case here. 
  'two thirty' could be a time expression, in which case it could also function as the time for the meeting. However, since the dialogue acts of the following two sentences are question and directive respectively, we classify this as question under question category.

"
1494,"Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and directive are both directive acts, so the classification of overinform is invalid. 
Question: there is no question in the provided text. 
  Directive: although the act inform is a request for information from a listener, it can also be used to express a command or order. Therefore, this classification is also invalid
Commissive : the only possible commissives in this example are the ones that are used in a negotiation, such as offer, counteroffer, and acceptance. However, in our example, there are no negotiations, therefore this is an invalid classification.

"
1495,"Inform (or informative) dialogue acts provide information to the
  recipient about something that happened or is happening to someone. 
  Examples include telling someone where to go for a good meal,

or 
 - asking someone for their opinion on a matter
 - providing information that someone else has about a person, place, event, etc.

"
1496,"This is an example of a directive dialogueact, where a person is asking another for a favour. The person providing the information is also asking the other person for their opinion, so it is considered a hybrid of question and directive.

"
1497,"Inform is a good dialogueact to use when you are providing or sharing information. It is typically used when the information is about something that is happening in present or future, and the receiver of the message has the option to take some action in response to this information (e.g. asking questions, performing actions, etc.).

over
question
directive
commissive

"
1498,"This text could be classified under question because it could indicate that there is a discrepancy between the bus's route and the book store's location. The bus could have been going to a different location than the one mentioned in the sentence. 
It could also be a statement of fact, where the author is sharing a piece of information that is already known to everyone.

"
1499,"In this example, ""sir,please wait"" is considered an inform command. The speaker (the driver) is asking a person (listener) to do something (take a No.50). 
  

A:
According to the Stanford Corenlp model, this is an informative command: ""Please wait.  The taxi driver are striking again.""
This is because ""please"" in this context is used as a polite request for the person to take action.

"
1500,"Question: thefaresto thatstop is unspecified, making it difficult to determine the expected value. 
  
Overinform: this is a very general question that does little to narrow down the value of thatfareto thatsto. 
Quotation: although the question is about a specific fare, it does provide a general answer, so it falls under the category of overinform.  This is because the answer is too general to be useful, as it provides no additional information that would help narrow the possible answers. The answer also includes words like ""it"" and ""would"", which indicate that this question may be asked by a machine and not a person. Therefore, this answer does nothing to help the dialogue agent determine if this person is expecting a particular fare.   
Directive: while the person asking the questions may want to know the price of a fare in that destination, they are also seeking guidance on how to proceed. In this case, asking them to specify the destination is directive. However, in this example, specifying the stop does no provide additional guidance. If the asker had specified thestop, then the response would have been more directive and specific to the actual askers destination.    
Commissive. Although theperson askingthe questions is not seeking to commit to a purchase, if the respondant does offer a price, that could be considered commissitive.

"
1501,"Inform is used when the sender is sharing information. For example, ""I'm going to the store to buy milk. Can you please bring me some?"". 
Question is when someone is asking for information from another person. ""Can you tell me what time the bus leaves?""
Directive is for when one person is giving orders to another.  ""I need you to bring milk to my house tomorrow at 8am.""
Commissive means that someone else is taking action or performing a task. The server said they will bring the bill next week.

"
1502,"In this context, ""stops"" can refer to the number of railway stations in a country. This is an example of an informational request or query, and the answer to this question is provided in the given passage.

"
1503,"Inform is the most common dialogue acts in this example. Inform acts are used when someone is providing general information to another person. For example, ""I'm going to the store to buy milk. Here is how much milk is in the fridge."" In this case, milk refers to a general concept, so inform is used. 
  
Question is another common act in dialogue. When someone asks a specific question to someone else, a dialogue ask is usually considered a query. ""Do you know where the nearest grocery store is?"" In that case the question is about finding a nearby grocery, and the answer is likely to contain a direction, such as ""turn right at the next traffic light."" 
   
Directive is also another important act to consider. Directives are usually given to people who are performing an action. So in that example ""Please stop at Starbucks on your way home."" The person giving the directive is probably trying to help the other person with their task. Commands are another type of act, where someone gives a direct order to perform an activity.  ""Put the milk in my fridge now!"" 
    
Commissive acts can also be important. These acts indicate that someone has made a promise or commitment to do something. A good example of a commissitive act would be ""If you eat only broccoli, you will be healthy."" This is not a good commissative act because it does nothing to indicate a person has committed to being healthy.

"
1504,"""when we"" indicates that the information provided is about a specific time in the future, and the question is whether that time is now. Based on this, it's likely that ""when"" refers to the time of the conversation, so the response is a request for information. 
  
  ""please tell"" suggests that this is an instruction, not a statement of fact.

"
1505,"In the given example,'sure' is used as a response marker. This is an informal response word that can replace a more formal response such as 'I am sure'. This word is commonly used in casual conversation and conveys a sense of certainty or assurance. 
  
'It's' in this example is another example of a casual response. 'It' can also be replaced with 'Yes' or 'Sure'. 
 'Free of Charge' also conveives a certainty, as it is stating something that is free.

"
1506,"Question: Do I need another transfer? 
Information: You don't need to transfer anymore after 50. 
  You have reached the maximum number of transfers allowed.

"
1507,"Inform is used to provide information to a human about something that does not require a response. In this example, it refers to publicspeaking. 
Question is the primary choice for a dialogue to take. It is a statement of inquiry or request for clarification from a person. 
  In this instance,  it is likely the person who is being asked a direct question about their ability to speak to people they have met just for  the first  time.

"
1508,"Inform is a dialogueact that is used to convey one's understanding or acknowledgement of something, such as a statement or topic. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive

"
1509,"This text starts by asking ""how"" are your wedding planning going, suggesting that there is some uncertainty or lack of clarity about the subject. 
Additionally, it appears that this is the first time the bride and groom are speaking to each other about their wedding, so there may be some initial confusion about what is happening. 
  
text:  'how're your wed planning?' 

 
based on this, I predict the dialogue acts to the question.

"
1510,"In this example, ""the only"" is a preposition that indicates a general statement about something that is shared in the conversation. In this case, it is used to indicate that there is only one thing not ready for the wedding, namely the bride's wedding gown. Therefore, inform is the correct classification for this dialogueact, as it indicates sharing information, not a request for a response.

"
1511,"Question: the given statement can also be seen as asking for information, so it is classified here. 
Overinform: this is the hardest classification to do, as there is no clear answer to this. Inform can mean many things, and the context of the conversation is missing. Therefore, this classification is difficult to justify. 
  

When will it be finished? 
 The dialogueact of that text is question.

"
1512,"""The dress makers said it would take two week"" is an example of information being provided. This is because the dress maker is providing information to a listener about a future event. 
However, ""it will take 2 weeks"" does NOT provide this information. Instead, it is a prediction or a statement of fact. Therefore, this is classified under inform.

"
1513,"Overinform: the message is too long and contains too much information
Question: there is no clear question being asked
Directive: a recommendation or course-of-action is being suggested
Commissive : the conversation is about to take a direction that is not consistent to providing the information in this message

A:
According to your explanation, it seems that you are right. The predicted label is ""question"".

"
1514,"In this example, we can see that although the dialogue acts are classified inform in the given example (based on a text that simply provides the observation of the hole in back of something), the actual behaviour of giving information can also be considered as a directive act, as the information is about a plan or intention of taking care for something.

"
1515,"Question is one of four possible predicted labels for a dialogue acts, where question is used to indicate a request for information, a query, an inquiry, etc. The question label is only used when the actual predicted label does not fit the context. 
In this case, based on your provided text and the surrounding context, it is clear that this is not a direct request or query for additional information. Rather, this appears to more closely match the description of an ""inquiry"" or ""query"".

Note that in some cases, there is ambiguity in the provided context and it may be difficult to determine the correct predicted act from the given context alone. In such cases where there are multiple options, we recommend using the ""context clues"" section of our dialogue act prediction model to help determine which option is most likely.

"
1516,"In this example, ""now"" is an adverb, and it is used to indicate time. ""Is a Queen - Size Bed Okay?"" is therefore a relative clause, with ""is"" being the relative pronoun. In relative clauses, an antecedent is typically a noun that is related to the clause's subject. Here, it would be the bride and groom, since they would typically be referred to as the groom and bride. However, this is ambiguous, as ""the bride"" and ""a queen size"" could also be antecedents. 
  
If we assume that ""The bride - Groom"" are the antecendents, then the question would become ""are a queensize bed ok?"". Since the Queen size is the subject of ""okay?"", the answer would then be ""yes"". 
 If we instead assume ""A Queen Size"" to also act as anantecedent, we would have the following question: ""what is  a queen size?"" This question is ill-formed, because a ""queen"" does not have a size.

"
1517,"""it’s $308 anight"" is over-specific, providing more information than is necessary for the listener to understand the context of the situation. 
the text is asking for a decision or response from ""the recipient"", which indicates that the information is being shared to guide the other person. 
  

A:
According to this page, there are 4 possible answers for inform: 

 

over-specifying the question
asking for clarification
providing information to another person
giving advice to a person

"
1518,"Inform is used when the information shared is for the benefit of the receiver. The speaker wants to provide the necessary information for someone else's benefit. In this case, it is the TV that is being provided to user. 
Overinform is when a speaker gives too much information. It is not useful or helpful to someone. For example, a user might say ""yes"" to a request for help when they really need to think about it first. Overinform can also be used to describe a situation when someone is oversharing information, such as when sharing too many details about a personal experience. 
  
Question is  used when asking someone a direct question. A question can be direct if it does not require an answer from another person. An example of a Direct question is ""are you hungry?"".  A question that requires an immediate answer is an interrogative question which is followed by an affirmative or negative response.   
Out of question question 	Question + affirmative response 			Out Of question
Direct question		Direct query + negative or affirmative	Answer
 commissitive	Commissive	+ negative answer	No response
 directive	Direction	 + positive answer 				Yes
 question		 + multiple answers							What?
question + answer 1 +  answer 2 +... + n answers	 					How many?

"
1519,"'b besides i wan two copies of the photo' can also be interpreted as a request, so the classification of 'inform' is not conclusive. 
the text can alternatively be classified under question as the inform and question dialogue acts are similar in meaning.

"
1520,"""Have you a round-neck sweater?"" is a question because it is asking a follow-up question to a previous question. ""Have any?"" can also be interpreted as a yes/no question but it does not have the same nuance as the question in this example. 
  
If the answer to this question is ""no,"" then the dialogue acts of the following lines are over-classified as questions:

the young woman responds with ""okay, then i will go shopping for one""
kirill responds ""i will ask my mom to buy one for me then""

"
1521,"In this example, it appears that the writer is trying to convince the reader that they are capable of performing the task without any help. This is an example of a commissIVE dialogueact, where a person is making an offer or promise to help the other person perform the action.

"
1522,"In this example, 'can I try one of these on?' is a direct question. However, in the context of a film review, this is more likely to indicate a recommendation or request.

"
1523,"the text uses the word ""sure"" at a later point in time, suggesting that it was not sure about something at first. This is an example of over-informing, as the information provided was unnecessary. 
it is also possible that this is just a grammatical construction where ""go ahead"" is used as a conjunction to connect two independent clauses. In this case, ""Sure"" would not be necessary.

"
1524,"This text contains information regarding the age of the reader. The age is relevant to whether or not the person should be instructed or suggested to purchase weed, and so the information is conveyed as ""over"" inform. 
In addition, this is the first mention of weed in the conversation, but it does so in a general way, without any indication of a relationship to a particular person or context. Therefore, it could be considered ""question"" or ""commitment"" rather than ""request"" and ""directive"".

A:
According to your explanation, ""the predicted dialog act"" is ""Inform"". But the actual result is different. I think it's because of ""light color"" in this sentence. ""For my Age, I would Prefer a Lighter Color"". It's a recommendation.

"
1525,"Dick is a first name. Based on this name, it is not clear whether the person being addressed is male or female. The speaker does not ask for permission or advice, nor does the message indicate that it was initiated by a request from the addressee. Instead, Dick is telling the listener that they should get coffee. Dick tells thelistener to get some (directive)
Overinform: the sender is providing too much information, not enough question. They are not asking for advice or permission, but instead are telling Dick to go get the coffee (inform) 
Question: is there a question here? The question is about whether to ask Dick for coffee or not (question)  
Directive: Dick should go and get (command) the  coffee (order) 
 Commissive : I will get you coffee, if you go to Dick and ask him to bring it to my room (request)

"
1526,"Question: ""Do you like coffee?""
Inform: Yes, I do. 
question: Do you really? I don 't honestly
like that stuff, it gives me headaches.

"
1527,"Directive is the most extreme form of dialogue acting. This is because it is considered the strongest form to reject all other possibilities. In this case, it can be interpreted as a strong instruction to the addressee to try to quit smoking. 
  

overinform: the information provided is too general and does not provide enough details to enable the recipient to make an informed decision. 
question: there is some ambiguity in the question or the request is unclear. The question is therefore not answered.  

"
1528,"Question is a more specific type of dialogue acts than inform and directive and it is used to probe for more information. In this case, cigarette has come up in conversation and the question is asking the other person about it. 
Inform is an affirmative act where the sender is assenting to something. The inform act can also be used as a way to introduce a topic or a person. 
  In this context, 'we spent a nice evenings together' is being informally assented to. This is why the act has also been categorized as inform. However, this does not make question or directive or commissives.

"
1529,"This text does not contain any information or details that would classify it as either a direct question or an instruction. The only information provided is the price of a product. 
  
However, it does contain information that could classify as an announcement or announcement of sale. For example, ""Today's Sale Price"" indicates the type of information being shared. Additionally, there is an offer of assistance being offered, asking if the person reading the message needs any assistance.

"
1530,"This text does indicate that you watched the movie, but it does so without your explicit consent. The price charged is therefore not a violation of your rights. 
  
You are free to watch the film for free, and if you do so, you are not obligated to provide feedback.

"
1531,"According to the dialogue acts listed in the table, this is an informative text. Informative texts share information that is relevant to a conversation, and are not asking questions, making promises, commanding, requesting, etc. 
  
  

  Based off of your provided text and my analysis, I predict that the correct dialogue action for this instance is 'inform'.

"
1532,"In the first sentence, ""the wrong"" information has not been specified. It is not clear whether the information provided is incorrect or incomplete. 
Later in the message, however, a more specific description of what the error is has appeared. ""I was"" indicates the mistake was made in ""was"" rather then ""will be"".

I know that it has a distance of 300 kilometers, but i will be traveling at night, so i should allow 3 hours.

"
1533,"the text contains an instruction or request for another chance to attempt something
this is a characteristic of a request dialogue acts, not a command or order

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible answers for a text to be classified under a specific dialogue tag: 
1. The answer is in a file that is available online.  2. A group of people came up with the answer and published it online, and you can find it in one of those files. 3. An answer was created by a company and the company published the solution online so that it can get the credit for it. 4. You wrote the code and came to an answer yourself.

"
1534,"In this example, ""oh yeah"" is the response to the question ""oolong Tea is Good for your health."" The speaker appears eager to confirm the information that was just provided.

"
1535,"This text indicates the direction or instruction of the person receiving the message. The person being instructed is likely a cash register or server, and they will need to take action to fulfill the directive.

"
1536,"This text indicates the need for clarification or an explanation. It is a simple question that requires a straightforward answer. 
  
  The tone of voice and the use of ""you're"" indicate that this is coming from a third party. ""You're charged"" implies that someone else is charging the customer for the movie.  ""You never seen"" suggests that there is some confusion about what was watched.

"
1537,"Over-prediction is a form of error in which a model predicts a response category that does not occur in the training data. This can happen when a category has a very rare occurrence in training, but occurs often in test data, leading the model to predict the rare category in a test response. 
In this case, inform is over-represented because of the high occurrence of question and directive in train data but only question in Test data

A:
According to this article, there are three main types of dialogue acts:  inform, query, and request.  The inform type is the most common, occurring in about 70% of cases.

"
1538,"Inform is a polite dialogueact that is used when someone is sharing information or facts. The inform dialogue acts are:
- Outline: ""I'm from the government, and I'm here to tell you...""
  - Question:  ""What's going on?""
    - Directive:   ""Stop what you're doing and listen to what I have to say.""
      - Commissive : ""Please let me explain what is going to happen.""

"
1539,"A:

I agree with the other answers that this is an informative text.  The text provides the reader with information that is relevant to their interests. 
In particular, it provides useful information regarding the smelling preferences of the speaker. 
       ""Nani"" is the name of a character in a novel that I am reading.   The name is used by the character to identify herself. She is introduced in the following manner: ""Nanni book shop. How can we help?""  This text refers to a conversation between the author and the readers. In this conversation, ""you"" are the ""reader"".  ""You"" can ask the questions and ""I"" will provide the answers. I will try to help ""You"".
       ""nanni"" means ""name"" in Italian.

"
1540,"Overinform: the prediction was incorrect and the actual label was question. 
Question: I was expecting a command or instruction, but instead I received information. 
  

A:
According to this article, there are four possible dialogue acts for a text: directive/inform, request/request, command/question, complaint/complaint.  The text you provided is clearly a complaint, so the dialogue is complaint.

"
1541,"Question is a dialogueact that is used to seek information. In this case, it appears that the question is seeking information from the listener about when it would best for the speaker to leave. 
Overinform is another term for question. This term is often used in machine learning to describe a prediction that includes information that isn't strictly necessary. For example, a model might predict that a person will be happy based on whether or not they are being complimented. However, if a compliment is included, then the model is overpredicting happiness, as a simple compliment would likely be enough to make someone happy. 
  
  In this example the compliment ""you really did well"" is enough information to predict happiness. Therefore, overinform would appear to apply.

"
1542,"In the first sentence, ""if"" is used to introduce a condition or requirement. Therefore, it can be classified under directive. 
""ready by"" can also be considered as a time requirement, so it could also fit under the directive category. 
  

However, in this second sentence the ""were they"" part of question is not present, and it seems like the person is asking about the time. In this case, we could classify it as question under inform or question category, but the use and structure makes this more likely to classified in question than in directive or inform category:
If you were ready...
  - by 6: 30, I would be there to meet you.

"
1543,"In the given context, it would be most unkind of the person asking for help to not send a repairman, so the response is a commissIVE instruction or order. 
However, this is most likely not the intended meaning, and the actual meaning is that someone could be asked to send help, indicating a query or a statement that could also be answered with a Commissive instruction.

"
1544,"In this example, based on their preference of drinking Tea at Teahouse, coupled with their asking the opinion of the person they are speaking to, this is likely a inform text. 
  
  The text: ""we like to drink tea in tea rooms. we have some new rooms rates available. would you be ok with that?"" indicates the author is looking for confirmation or approval from their listener.

"
1545,"inform is the most likely dialogueact, since the message is simply providing information. Additionally, there are several clues in the passage that inform is likely the correct classification, such as the use ""is there"" and ""are there,"" which are questions when used with a response. 
 question is another likely classification for this passage, because the question marks at both ends of  the passage indicate that this is indeed a  question being posed. However, it's important to note that question could also be classified out ofinform, if the ""room services"" were not a request for assistance. 
question is also a likely choice, given that ""anything i could do"" is not an explicit request, and the lack of any explicit requests for help or assistance indicates a more general query.

"
1546,"This text is asking for information, so it likely has a query or question dialogue tag. 
""i"" is used to request information and is an indicator of question in this context. 
  ""a"" can be used as an indefinite article, and it can also be a pronoun to replace ""they"". 
   ""what"", ""who"", and ""which"" are all words that can replace the indefinite pronoun ""a"". 

 

A:

I'd say it's a direct question: ""What were them?"".  The question mark at the end of that sentence is the clue that this is indeed a ""question"".  
Direct questions are often used when you want to know something but don't want the other person to ask you.

"
1547,"the text uses the verb ""take"" to indicate that a person will take
  message, indicating that it's a request for someone else to perform a
request. 
also, there is no mention of when the person is expected to show up. it
seems like the request is open-ended, and the directive act cannot be
inferred from this dialogue.

"
1548,"the text contains a request for a callback, indicating that this is a person who is expecting a response to a message they sent. 
robert is the name of jordans famous basketball player. he is young and single. therefore, it would be reasonable for the caller to ask for his callback.

"
1549,"the text is commissively commanding the listener to do something (i.e. tell the person eating baked chickens to eat more chicken). 
this is not the expected behavior from a commissivo dialogue acts. Commissivos are typically asking questions or giving commands. 

 

A:

I would say that it is a direct question because the question mark is at the end of the sentence. The sentence is: ""so why then did I speedup?"".

"
1550,"Directive is the most likely dialogueact for this example, as the statement ""i want"" indicates a request for something to happen. This is in contrast to the other dialogue acts, where there is no indication of a desire for the action to occur. 
  
  The statement also indicates the subject of the request is ""passport"". This indicates there may be an implied request to provide identification, and the directive dialogueacts are typically used for requesting something from another person.

"
1551,"This text is asking the caller for their number, indicating that they are expecting a call from the person they're speaking to. 
They are providing the phone numbers, not informing the receiver of the information. 
  They're asking questions, such as ""of course"" and ""here it"" which indicate that there is more information being withheld.  

A:
According to the book ""Communicating with Confidence"" by Robert C. Martin, there are four types of dialogue acts: Commissives, Informatives, Questioners, Directivists. Commisive is the opposite of these.

"
1552,"This text asks for confirmation, indication that someone agrees with something. 
It is not a request for information, a recommendation or a suggestion.

"
1553,"Question: ""Do you also want the passport of her friend?""
Overinform: the friend of my friends is also a friend. I want both of their passports. 
  Question (indirect): Do you mean the passport of...? 
   Question : Yes, I also mean her friends pass...
Directive: Please give me both their passport.

"
1554,"Question: This is an example of asking an open - ended question. The question marks indicate that there is uncertainty in the answer, and the surrounding text provides more information to help answer the question

Inform: this is another example where the inform text is providing additional information. In this case, it is stating that a carry on item is available for the passenger.

"
1555,"Mr.Sandals is not a person, so it's not possible to ask him a direct question; however, it seems like the person who is speaking to Mr Sandal is expecting him to provide information, and the use of the question mark indicates this is what is being asked. 
It's possible that this person is simply being unclear, but it would be helpful to know more about the context of their communication to make an informed decision.

"
1556,"Directive dialogue acts are used to request or order someone to do something. They are not used for sharing or providing facts. The following are some examples of directives:

- I would like you to please close the door. 
This text contains a request for someone (the speaker) to open a suitcase. In this request, someone is asked to perform a task. This is a commissitive dialogue. 
  
  - Please open that box over there.  This is an order for something to happen. Someone is being asked or ordered to pick up the box.

"
1557,"In this example, it seems that the person is being a bit too pushy, and is asking for the pictures immediately. This is not the right way to ask, as the other party might not be ready to give them immediately, or might need to think about it first. The person should have waited a little longer before asking, to make sure that they are actually ready and willing to do so. 
  
Another reason why the act could be classified commissively is that there is no indication that this is a proposal or offer. In fact, if the receiver of these instructions is interested, they could simply accept the request and give the picture. So, in that case the dialogue acts should be commissives, not directives.

"
1558,"Question: the phrase 'how Can I Help You?' is questioning, asking for assistance. 
Inform: it's a greetings, not a request for help.

"
1559,"Inform is characterized by expressing gratitude or anticipation, without asking a direct question or making a request. 
Overinform is when the message contains too much information, making it difficult for recipients to process the information. 
  Question is marked by a declarative statement that seeks confirmation or information through a response.  
  Directive is used when a person or entity is requesting something of another. Commissive indicates a third party is making an offer or proposal.

"
1560,"This text contains a request for knowledge or information, indicating it's a  question. 
While the question is posed to a person, it also appears to be directed at a food source, plants or live animals. These are all characteristics of questions.

"
1561,"Inform is the most general dialogueact, and indicates a general discussion of information or a request for information, such as ""can you tell me more?"". 
  
Question is another general indication of inquiry, asking a follow-up question or seeking additional details. 
Directive is used when the person speaking is giving orders or taking action, or when a conversation is moving in a specific direction.  For example, ""go to the store and buy milk"" is an example of directive.   
Commissive indicates when someone is expressing their feelings or opinions, like ""this is so frustrating!"".

"
1562,"the text uses the word ""lock"" to request the suitcase to be locked, suggesting that this is an order or instruction. 
based on this request and given that suitcase is something that is personal and may contain valuables, it would be wise to follow the instruction from a person in authority. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think the following is the correct classification: 

 
question: What were the room service?
directive: There is nothing I can help you with?

"
1563,"inform is used when the conversation is about providing information, not asking a direct question
question is the default dialogue form, and inform is only used to express uncertainty or when a more specific form is needed
directive is often used in situations where a person or entity is requesting that something be done, such as when requesting a waiter to bring a drink to someone at a dinner party
commissive can be used for either a request or a command, but is more often associated with a demand or order, as in ""Would you please pass the salt?""
out is an option form that indicates an unvoiced form of no, similar to the negative form in English

A:
According to your explanation, inform and question are used only when more precise forms are needed. So, in this case, directive and commissives are the most appropriate.

"
1564,"Inform is a dialogue-act type that is used to share information. In this case, ""i bought"" is the information being shared, while ""a chinese dress"" and ""in your store"" are the sources of that information (the latter two being statements). The inform dialogue acts are not asking, telling, commanding, pleading, requesting, suggesting, etc.

"
1565,"Question: the dialogue acts that are similar to question are question and interrogative. Question is used to ask for information or clarification, while interrogatives are used in questions to express uncertainty. In this example, ""yes?"" is an interrogativel. 
  
  The speaker seems to be asking for confirmation, as the response is ""Yes?"". This is similar in form to the question ""are you sure?"", where the answer is also "" yes"". 
   
However, there is a subtle difference between the two. When asking ""Are you Sure?"" the intention is for your answer to confirm what the asker already knows. However, in this case, it is unclear whether the person being asked is sure or whether they are just saying yes. Therefore, this is classified under question.

"
1566,"Over-estimating the informativeness of a text is a common source of misunderstanding. The inform category includes all statements that are likely to provide useful information to a recipient. Statements that include a request, command, promise, complaint, apology or other indication of commitment are considered questions. 
  Statements expressing gratitude or expressing surprise are not considered to be questions, even if they include the word ""why"". 
   Statments that express a desire or intention to do something are also not questions and are therefore included in this category. However, statements expressing opinions or feelings are questions because they are often intended to elicit a response from the addressee.

"
1567,"Question dialogue acts are used to seek information or advice from another person. The question in the above text indicates the need for an answer, so the question dialogueact is appropriate. 
  
Out of the four possible dialogue Acts, Question is the most common. It is used in everyday conversation to ask a person a direct question or to request information.

"
1568,"This text indicates an action to be taken, not a conversation. Therefore, this is classified under directive.

"
1569,"Directives are statements that seem to offer assistance, guidance or
  instructions to the addressee. They are used to make requests or to
request information from the recipient. 
  Based On the provided text ""things
are going
well with you"", the response should be classified under directive as
the response seems like it offers assistance to  the asker.

"
1570,"Question: ""then"" is used as a transition between two clauses. This indicates a questioning or interrogative sentence structure. 
Then I'll Come to Your Place Later in The Evening And How Late Is Your Shop Open? 



Inform: This text is providing information to a listener. 
  The speaker has shared their personal approach for eating fruits vegetables and Chicken.


Directive:  This text indicates an order or instruction.  
  Please tell the listener how to proceed. 


Commissive : This is the last predicted label for this dialogue. It is not applicable as the dialogue is ending. However, it may be of interest to know that this label is often used when a conversation is winding down. For example, if a person is talking to another person and the conversation becomes more general, they may use this type of label to express that they are sharing a general thought or feeling. They may also use it when they want to make a suggestion or offer advice. In this case, you may want the other person to do something, so the person uses this as an expression of suggestion. If the conversational topic is no longer relevant, then the label may indicate that a topic has come up that is now of more interest than the original topic. An example of when this would be appropriate is if the two people are in a car and one person starts to talk about their favorite hobby, such as fishing, while the car is in motion. At some point, this topic may come into play, but it becomes less relevant as they drive. Then, when the driver gets to their destination, their fishing hobby may become more relevant. Therefore, at that point they might share their thoughts on fishing. A similar example would include the topic of the shop owner's hours of operation. When the people first meet, hours may not be an issue. But as time goes on, more and more information is exchanged, until eventually the issue of hours becomes relevant again. So, in this example the store owner may share that their hours are now open until 10pm. And then, later on in their conversation, perhaps the owner is asked about when their store is open on Sundays. Here, because hours is still an important topic, even though it was not as relevant at the start of their interaction, than store hours on sunday is of greater interest. Thus, using this kind of dialogue label when you want your conversation to wind down would make sense. You can also find this particular label used in many greetings and farewells. Example: When someone says ""see you later"", they mean ""until then"". When a customer leaves a store, a salesperson may say ""have a nice day"" or ""goodbye"".

"
1571,"This text contains a request for confirmation, suggesting that there is a commitment being requested or promised. The request is for the recipient to confirm that 8pm is the time that she is expecting to see the sender. 
  
However, there are no commands or requests being issued in this statement, so it cannot be classified a commissIVE dialogue.

"
1572,"In the first paragraph, it's not clear whether the person asking the question is the same person who announced the raise. If the asker is not the announcee, then the dialogue acts are overinform and question; if the two are thesame person, than the dialogue act would be question as the announcer is seeking confirmation or information from the other party. 
  
If the boss announced it, and the employee is wondering how big of an increase they'll receive, they would use question to seek confirmation from their boss.

"
1573,"Inform is a prediction that is based on a combination of the language used in the passage and the context of its occurrence. Inform, as the prediction label implies, is used to inform someone of something that they did not know. The inform prediction is overinform, because the inform label was also given for another prediction, namely question. Question is also a useful prediction when used correctly, but it can also be used incorrectly, for example when the question is not specific enough to be a valid question or when it contains too much information.

"
1574,"This text contains an element of uncertainty or ambiguity, as the
  speaker is not clear about whether they will be speaking for more

than one year, or whether the event they mentioned happened last
year. 
It is also worth noting that there is a lack of urgency in this
statement, where the ""it"" being mentioned could refer to either the tea
or the promise of more good things to come.

"
1575,"In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, because the message is conveying information. The message does contain a request for an opinion, however, it is not a direct question or a command. Rather, its tone is more of a friendly inquiry. 
  
  The text: ""hello this, m, i, c, h, e, l, p, a, r, are, your, personal, weaknesses?"" is a good example of an inform text. In this case, ""your"" is being used as an adjective to describe a person, so the question is about that person's weaknesses.  

"
1576,"""I'm"" is the first person singular present tense form of the verb ""to be"". This is a common way to introduce oneself in English. The use of ""I"" in this way is not specific to this passage. 
In the context of a shopping trip, ""going shopping"" implies that someone is going out to do a task that is typically done in the home, such as shopping. 
  

I am going shopping in little while.

"
1577,"Question dialogue acts are used when the information provided is not sufficient to make a decision or provide a recommendation. For example, a customer service agent might ask a simple question like 'how may I help you?' to determine if the caller has a service issue or is looking for information, and to assess the urgency of the request. 
  
In contrast, inform and Commissive dialogue Acts are typically used to provide information and make recommendations. Commissives are often used in negotiations and contracts to request a specific action from the other party. Inform dialogueacts are commonly used by the person being talked to to share their thoughts or opinions, for example 'I think you should do X'.

"
1578,"In this case, we can see that 'we are out food' is an informational statement, not a request for assistance. Therefore, this is over-informative and not directive. 
However, if the context had been different, and the statement had come from the employee of the bookshop, then it could have been considered a query or command.

"
1579,"Question: ""what toget?"" is a request for information, not a statement of direction. 
Overinform: the question is too general, it does  not narrow down the options. ""get"" is an uncountable noun, so the answer should be a list of items. 
  Question ""What to Get?""
  Overinform:  the answer is ""a tie, a sweater, socks, underwear, jeans, t-shirt, sneakers, phone, laptop, charger, headphones, remote, blender, coffee mug, alarm clock, clock radio, toaster, kettle, mixer, juicer, espresso machine, spatula, bowl, cutting board, knife, fork, oven mitts, grill, broiler, steamer, wok, rice cooker, slow cooker""

Directive: this is the most likely type of answer, since it contains a series of actions to be taken. The recipient is expected to take the actions specified.  
Commissive : this answer contains commitments, such as promises or orders.

"
1580,"In this example, inform is the most probable dialogue
  act, as the information provided is likely about a
personal preference of the author. However, this is not
a guarantee that inform will be the correct dialogue 
  label, and we would need to know more about this
author's preferences to be more confident in our
prediction.

"
1581,"Directive acts are used to ask for something to a person or a group. In this case, you are asking John to go check something in the fridge. 
  

Out of directive: the information provided in this dialogue is not enough to understand what John should do. The speaker is providing additional information that is needed to complete the request. For example, ""when you get a chance, please check in my office"". 
   
Question acts ask someone to do something. This text does ask John a direct question: ""John, when you have a minute, could you please go to the office and see if there is anything in there you need?"". However, this is a ""question"" only in a strict grammatical sense. A question is an act where the answer is either a statement of fact, a request for information (e.g. ""is it hot in here?""), or an order (i.e ""open the window""). 
    
Over question and question act: this act contains information which could be a fact (the room has a refrigerator), a recommendation (you should check it), an instruction (open it) or something else. But the question mark in front of it does make it a 'question act'. 
     
 commissitive acts make promises. John is promised a certain action in return for an action. Here, John will go into the room and look for a present for his girlfriend.

"
1582," commissives are used to express commands, requests, and suggestions. In this case, Mike is suggesting that you ask him how he is doing. 
question and directive are the other two possible dialogue acts for this context. However, based on your explanation, it is clear that the prediction for question was incorrect, as the question is about the well being of the person speaking to the phone, not the content of what is being asked. And the directive is not applicable either, since the statement is that Mike should ask the how question of himself.

"
1583,"Question: This text indicates a desire for more information from the listener. It is not a statement of fact or a demand for a response. Rather, this is an inquiry seeking more details. 
In contrast, commands and promises are statements of facts or requests for responses. They are not inquiries.

"
1584,"Question: the taxi driver is on a strike, what is the reason? 
Inform: taxi strike is ongoing, check the local news for updates.

"
1585,"Inform is a good dialogue action to use when sharing information. The information provided in the example text was specific and did not contain any directives or commitments.

"
1586,"""make that"" is a directive sentence marker, meaning ""make"" + ""that"" = ""do""
the text is asking the person to make the list

text: ""the dialogue acts of the following text have beenclassified as question"" 
based on this sentence, ""question"" was the classification of ""dialogue act"" in the previous sentence.

"
1587,"This is the first occurrence of the dialogue acts question and directive in the same conversation. 
question is used to ask about needs, while directive is to express one's will. In this case, it seems that the bookshop employee is expressing a need for assistance and is requesting the buyer to help them. 
"
1588,"Directive is used when the message is about future actions. In this case, it's about signing the contract, so the response should make the person feel like they are being told what to do next. However, this response does neither ask for information, nor does it give any commands or promises. Instead, a directive message conveys information and makes the other person aware of the action that is to take place. 
  
Overinform is when a message does ask about information but the answer is too much. This is what is happening here. The response is providing too many pieces of facts and information. While this may be helpful in conveying the information that was asked for, there is also toomuch information in this message, making it difficult to understand what the question was about. 
Question is another type of message that can appear in a similar situation. Here, we have a text that starts by asking ""believe this or what?"". If we look at the surrounding text we see that someone is asking someone else a direct question. So, in that case the first step is identifying the actual question that appears in context. Then, using the model we can predict the correct dialogue acts for this question and provide the appropriate response.

"
1589,"""Thank you"" is an example of expressing gratitude or appreciation. This text conveYS information regarding the feelings of its speaker. 
'That's kind' is a superlative adjective, describing the given action as being kind or generous. 
  This is not a command or request, and it does convey information.

"
1590,"A:

I agree with the other answer that this is an example of a ""yes/no"" question: ""bother me again and I'll have you arrested"".
However, I would argue that it's not a simple yes/yes question; it has a yes-no sub-question embedded in it.  The subquestion is ""will you have me arrested?"".

"
1591,"""yes"" is a yes-no question that indicates the information is not important to the answer. 
the speaker has shared their dietary preferences, so the response is informational. 
"
1592,"Question: the sender is posing a yes or no question to another person. 
Overinform: this is not a clear question and the answer is likely not relevant to this situation. 
  Question, inform: I am trying to help the receiver with a query. I do not know the context of the query, so I cannot answer it.  
  question, direct:  I am asking a follow-up question in order to better understand the situation
Directive: This person should do something.

"
1593,"Question is an interrogative sentence structure that conveYS a message asking for information or clarification. In this case, ""can I?"" is asking ""Can I assist you with something?"". 
In contrast, inform is not a dialogue structure, so the question label is unnecessary.

"
1594,"Directive acts are used to request or order someone to do something. The
  given text implies the baggage holder is requesting or ordering the
passenger to retrieve their luggage. 
  
Overinform acts include information that is redundant or unnecessary. In this case, it would be redundant to provide the given tag as the passenger has already been provided a yellow light to slowdown. 
Question acts ask for information. As the tag is for a request for
baggage retrieval, and the provided text does not contain any information
about the request, then it can be classified under this act. However,
without knowing the context of when the question was asked, we cannot
confirm this categorization.  Question marks are often used in dialogues
to indicate uncertainty.   
Inform acts provide information to the receiver. Based on this given
text, inform is the correct classification as this acts is used for the purpose of providing relevant information, in this specific case the name of my luggage tag, to my receiver, who is presumably the bag holder.

"
1595," commissives are used when the other person is responsible for the action being requested. For example, if a person asks you to do something for them, it's likely that they will be the one who has to carry it out. In this case, they are asking you for a command. 
over Commissives:

inform: this is information being provided to the listener
question: the information is being sought by the person speaking
directive: a direct order is given to someone
commissive : a order or request is made to another person to take action on someone's behalf
request: someone is asking for something
order: an order to perform an action is issued
command:  a command is sent to a group of people to accomplish a task
instruction: instructions are given for another to follow
beseech: one pleads with another for help
entreat: you ask someone for assistance
recommend: something is suggested to help someone make a decision
suggest: another is asked to think of something

"
1596,"Inform is used when the message is providing information, not seeking confirmation or a request for agreement. 
Question is the most common dialogue action used for seeking more information. It is also used in requests for confirmation, requests to elaborate, directives, commands, promises, etc.

"
1597,"Question: I was unable to make it to the basketball games on fridays. 
Over Inform: Unfortunately, I had to cancel my plans to come to town this weekend. 
  Question : Why? 
   Question  : My mom had a medical emergency and had surgery this past weekend, so I needed to take care of her. I'm so sorry.  
Directive: Please call the school and make sure they find a replacement for you. You will be responsible for your own ticket.   
Commissive : I will do that. Thank you for understanding.

"
1598,"In this case, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the message is attempting to provide information to the receiver. The message does not contain any instructions or requests, and instead simply provides information. Additionally, there is nothing in the context of these words that indicates a request for confirmation or a directive to accept the information being provided. Therefore, this is an example of an inform text.

"
1599,"Inform (also called report or tell) is a dialogue action that conveys facts or information to a listener without asking a follow-up question or making a request or promise. 
  
  The taxi driver strike mentioned in the passage is an event that happened recently. The strike involved taxi cab drivers in London, and the strike was called off recently after the taxi cabs drivers agreed to accept a new contract with Transport for London. Inform is the most appropriate dialogue  action for this situation, as it conveYS facts about an ongoing event without requiring a response.

"
1600,"Question: the dialogue acts of 'who endedup winning?' are question and question is the most likely dialogue action. This is because the question marks the beginning of a sentence which is seeking information from a listener, and the sentence is not providing information, making a claim, asking for confirmation, providing a recommendation, giving advice, offering a suggestion, expressing a request, issuing a challenge, requesting assistance, inviting a guest, directing a subordinate to perform a task, commanding a superior to do something, commending a colleague, thanking a helper, etc. 
Note that this classification is based on a trained model and not on any human judgement.

"
1601,"Our team won the game. 
Yes, our team, specifically, was the victor.

"
1602,"In the first sentence, ""i'm mad"" is an adjective describing the state of the main character. This is a statement of fact, not a request for a fact. 
""i didn’t go"" implies that the character is responsible for not going, so it is not asking about a state. Therefore, this is classified under inform. 
  
However, in the second sentence the ""that night"" suggests a time or event, but the context is missing. Without context, it's not possible to determine if the statement is about an event that happened or a future event. In either case, asking ""will i be free"" would be a direct question or promise rather than an informational statement.

"
1603,"In this example, ""what else"" is a vague term that does little to clarify the situation. The speaker does nothing to seek clarification, and instead appears surprised by the information provided. Therefore, this falls into the category of ""overinform"".

A:
According to the GPT-2 model, inform is the most likely dialogue acts.

"
1604,"This text contains a query (question mark), which indicates the presence of an uncertainty or an unanswered question. The query is ""what is the final score?"". 
In addition, it also contains information (italicized), suggesting that this is an informational text. 
  The final result of Dota 2 championship was 8-7 in favor of Team Liquid.

"
1605,"'oh so does i' is an affirmative statement that provides additional information to the information given before. 
'this is so exciting' can also be consider as a confirmative sentence, providing additional details about what was just said.

"
1606,"Inform is the most common dialogue acts in this example. ""yep, we know"" is aninformative response to the question ""are we there yet?"". By providing a yes or no answer, it confirms the information that they already know and indicates that this is sufficient for them to continue. 
  
Question is used in the last example, where the response ""great"" indicates the first person is asking aquestion. A question is normally used to seek clarification or information from the other person. In this case, however, this person has already provided the requested information, so the second person's response is not seeking clarification but instead simply expressing agreement.

"
1607,"inform is the default dialogue action in most cases. It indicates the information being provided is not new to the listener, and the person providing the content is simply seeking confirmation or additional information
question indicates a new piece of information has just been presented to a listener.  The person asking the question is looking for confirmation of what was just presented
directive is used when a person is requesting a change to another person's behavior. For example, a salesperson might ask a customer to buy a product they don't need
commissive indicates an action that is being requested from another. An example of commissives is when someone is threatening to do something bad to you if you don’t do what they want.

"
1608,"Out of the four possible labels, inform is the most appropriate. This text does provide useful information to a listener, and the information is shared between two individuals.

"
1609,"This text can also be read as an invitation to shop online. 
  The text ""have  you ever shopped online?"" can mean ""would you like to try shopping on-line?"" or ""do you have any experience in shopping?"". In this case, 'have' is an imperative verb, indicating that someone should try to do something. This is classified in the question category because the request is for a response and the answer is expected to contain a try or experience.

"
1610,"This text indicates the desire for the receiver to confirm the information provided. The sender wants to ensure that they are providing accurate information and that their request is being accepted.

"
1611,"Inform (Over Question, Directive, Commisive) is a dialogueact that is used when the dialogue partner is provided with information, rather than asking a direct question or making a request. The inform act can be used in different contexts, such as when a person is giving information to another person, sharing information with someone, providing general information in a non-judgmental way, etc.

"
1612,"In the beginning of the paragraph, ""heard some"" indicates the speakers have only heard something, not seen it with their eyes. So the dialogue acts of ""hear some friend say"" and ""read an article"" are over-classified as ""overheard"".
""quite different"" can also be categorized under ""question"" because it asks a ""how are"" question about another person.

"
1613,"Inform is used to confirm or agree with a previously stated fact or information. In this case, 'Sure.' is an affirmative statement that confirms the information provided in the previous sentence. 
  
Overinform is when a dialogue acts contains too much information, making it difficult for the dialogue Acts to communicate.  In this example, although the inform act contains the words'sure.' it does so in a way that indicates the statement is not a simple affirmance. 'What about' is the way the question is expressed, suggesting the query is being made.

"
1614,"In this example, we can see that this is an informational text. The speaker provides the reader with information that is relevant to the topic of the conversation. This text does ask questions, such as ""to fail"" and ""what is the meaning of to fail?"". However, these questions are not the main purpose of providing the information. Instead, this information is provided to provide the context for the question. For example: ""To fail: to not pass a class"" is a better context to ""What is to failed?"" than ""Are you passing your classes?""

A:
According to this article, there are 4 types of dialogue acts: 
1. Request: This is used when someone asks you something.  2. Commendation: This is when you tell someone something good that happened. 3. Inform: When someone shares information to you. 4. Question: To ask someone a direct question
So, in this case, ""inform"" would be the right dialogue action.

"
1615,"'paying online' is a verb, so it is an informational statement. 
the speaker does feel that paying via the internet is less safe than doing it in person, however, they are not sharing any evidence to support this claim. 
  

A:
According to the BNC, paying in-person is directive.  Paying online, inform.

"
1616,"In the given context, a request for confirmation is made by the author. The author is trying to make sure that their intention of shopping on a street is understood by their friend. Therefore, they are asking their friends if he/she wants to go with them.

"
1617,"Overinform: This classification indicates the dialogue acts are too informative, as they provide too much information. 
Question:  This classification suggests the dialogues act may be a request for information from the listener. 
  Directive: Directives are commands that tell someone what to or how to act, think, etc. In this case, it seems like the information is being asked for, so this classification is not applicable.  
Commissive (or commissarial): This is a rare classification for dialogue Acts. Commissarial acts can be used to express feelings or emotions, but they are not commands or orders. They are used in requests and suggestions. The information provided in this example does make sense, however, because it provides a rationale for the action that was taken.

"
1618," commissives are used when the sender wants to make the receiver do something. For example, if I ask you to clean my room, you would probably consider it as a request to do a task, not a direct order to perform the cleaning. 
overinform,question,directive,commissive are the possible dialogue acts of ""you should clean your room""

A:
According to your text the dialogue Act is Commissive. The following are possible Commands from your dialogue Acts: 

 

You should Clean your Room
I want you  to Clean my Room

"
1619,"Question: This text asks a direct question about how long it takes to travel from a given location to the downtown area of London. The question is not answered by the provided information and therefore is classified a ""question"" rather then an ""out"" or ""over"".

A:
According to this page, ""Question"" is one of four possible dialogue acts.  The other three are ""Inform"", ""Request"", and ""Command"".  
""Informat"" would be a good guess for the answer to your question since it is a form of ""Information"" which would also be an appropriate response.

"
1620,"This text does not contain a clear indication of who is speaking to whom. The greeting is followed immediately by an unclear request for assistance. It is not clear whether the request is for a person to take someone else’s place in the car or to drive the vehicle. 
  
In addition, this is the first part in a longer text that contains multiple requests for information from a recipient, and the requests are not clearly aligned with a particular sender. For example, it is unclear whether this request should be answered by the driver or the passenger. Furthermore, there is no indication in this context of whether it would be the front or back seat that is being requested. Therefore, based on these factors, we cannot determine the correct dialogue action.

"
1621,"There is no mention of any companies in the given neighbourhood. The question is therefore seeking information or confirmation. 
If the question was seeking only confirmation, it would have been inform (not question). 

 

A:

This is an example of an inform question: ""Is a Queen-Size Bed Okay?""
It's an informational question because it's seeking clarification or an answer.  It is not a request for information (which is inform).  
Inform questions are typically used when the asker is looking for a recommendation or opinion. 
 For example:  ""Do you want fries with that?  Or may I suggest a salad?""  This question would be informational.

"
1622,"In this example, it can clearly be seen that the inform dialogue acts are the most appropriate. The first sentence provides the information that a baked Chicken is generally low in fat. Therefore, this is a fact that is personal to this speaker and does not require a response from the listener. Additionally, there is no question asked in this sentence, so the predict dialogue action is also inform as it provides factual information.

"
1623,"Question acts are used when someone is trying to find out information from another person. In this case, it's likely that ""the 7 th floor belongs to the company"" and the person asking the question is looking for confirmation. 
  
Out of question question and question dialogue acts, direct dialogue Acts are associated  with giving orders or instructions to another. The commissives are typically used to make commitments.

"
1624,"In this example, ""the 6 and the 7 floor"" is information provided by the author. The author is trying to provide the reader with as much information as possible about a building, so that the readers can make an informed decision about which floor to visit. 
However, this is only one example of how to classify the dialogue acts in the given example. Other ways to do so include:

If the information is about multiple buildings, then the classification could be multiple. For example: ""The 6, 7, 8, and 9 floors"" would be information, while ""this building has 6 6 floors and also 7 7 floors."" would fall under multiple because there is more than one number of floors. 
  
Alternatively, if there are multiple actions that could apply to the provided information then it could also be classified under inform. In this case, there could have been multiple commands or promises that can be applied to ""our company's two floor"". The classification would then be: over multiple, multiple over, over single, single over.

"
1625,"Question: ""Do we"" have ""our own"" staff ""restaurant?""

This is a direct question asking if the listener has heard of a particular company. The question is not answered by the information provided, so it is classified here.

"
1626,"Inform is the most common dialogue acts in this example. ""yes"" is used to confirm the information provided in the previous paragraph.

"
1627,"This text begins with a greeting, ""good mor..."", which can imply that this is an informal conversation. However, it also implies the opposite, that there is formality to the interaction. The use of ""sir"" at the beginning of the sentence is also a form of address, suggesting a more formal setting. 
  
Additionally, this sentence contains the word ""may"", a word that is used to introduce a request in some languages. This suggests that a formal request is being made. 
Finally, although the dialogue acts of both inform and question are possible, based on this context, we predict that ""question"" is the correct dialogueact.

"
1628,"Directive is the most common predicted act for this type of text. In this example, mrs. Smith is expressing gratitude for an earlier appointment, offering an apologetic for arriving late, then ending the conversation. 
Question is another common prediction for these types of texts.  In this case, it is unclear what the appointment is for, so the question mark is displayed.

"
1629,"Mr. Richard of World Trading Company is not a proper name, so the system was not able to provide a correct answer. 
Additionally, this is an inquiry question that is looking for specific information from its recipient, indicating that this was indeed a request for an information.

"
1630,"In the first example, inform is the correct classification because of two reasons. First, thank-you is an expression of gratitude, so inform would be the most appropriate classification. Second, although the example is about food, it is not a command, request, or commitment, therefore inform should be used. 
Second example: the question is one of seeking clarification. The speaker wants to know what the answer is, hence question should apply.

"
1631,"Out of the four possible dialogue acts, this is the only one that is not a statement or a request for clarification, but rather a directive. A directive is used when the sender is trying to influence the listener's behavior. In this case, Mr. Johnson was asked to do something by Mr Richardson, so Mr Johnson is being directive in his response. 
  

A:
According to this article, there are 5 types of dialogue Acts: 
1. Commands: Used to give orders or requests.  Examples: ""Call the hospital"", ""Stop the car"", ""Give me the keys"".
2. Statements: Used to make statements.  Example: “I am going to take the next exit after the third traffic light.”
3. Questions:Used for asking questions. Example:“Why is there a traffic jam?”
4. Requests for Clarification: This is when one wants to know more information or details. Examples:”Can you tell me what this book is about?” “Can I have a copy of that book?”  “Can we meet tomorrow?” 
5. Information:This is for sharing information that does not require a response such as a weather report or traffic report. “It is raining.” “The traffic is bad.”  

In your case the response is information so the answer is yes, they are asking a simple question but the question is very important because it's about their family and it could be very interesting to Mr John Johnson.

"
1632,"This text is a command, asking the listener to do something. Based on its structure, this is likely a message from the system to ask the user to wait, as the dialogue acts of waiting and informing are often used together.

"
1633,"This text indicates the asker is looking for information, so the dialogue acts out of question and question are appropriate. 
However, this is also a declarative statement and the question mark indicates uncertainty, suggesting the answer is not known. The askers tone suggests they are being polite and would like to help, but do not know the preferred drink. In this case, it would be more appropriate to use the inform dialogue action.

"
1634,"Inform acts are used when the information provided is understood by the recipient. The recipient is not asked a direct question or given a specific command or promise, but rather is provided with information that is relevant to their current situation. 
  
  Out ofinform: This type of act can be used to provide information to someone who is currently not aware of the topic. For example, a relative who has not heard from you in a while might receive an out ofform message to see if they can catch up. Out of form: A person who does know the subject but is confused or doesnot fully understand it. An employee who asks a manager for information on a topic they are already aware is using an act outof form.

"
1635,"directive is an act that conveys a request or order to another person or entity. In this case, it is likely that the request is to purchase the items listed in the conversation. 
question is another possible classification for this act. The question could be asked because it appears that there is some uncertainty about whether or not the purchase is necessary.

"
1636,"Inform: This is a confirmation of their reservation. The speaker does this by acknowledging the information that was provided. 
Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are combined, indicating that this is an overly detailed response. 
  Question: this question is asked of Mr. Sandals, and is not answered. It is therefore classified here.  
Directive: Mr Sandal is instructed to give his phone #. He is neither providing the directive nor is he being commanded to do so. Therefore, this dialogue action is classified under commissIVE.

"
1637,"In this case, ""how may I Help You?"" appears as a query, rather than a
statement of assistance. In other words, it does not appear to the
listener as if the person asking the question is offering help. 
  
This is because the phrase is followed by a colon, and the word ""help""
isn't capitalized. Thus, a listener might assume that ""How May I
Help You?"", is the name of an entity, such as an organization or
individual, that is requesting assistance from the caller.

"
1638,"This text is asking the user a general question about current and future energy usage, and is therefore classified here as inform. 
However, if the reader does nothing, then the system should report the next action as break in (i.e. a security system will report that a door has broken into).

"
1639,"Inform (the default dialogue action) is used when the information provided is sufficient to understand the meaning of the statement. In this case, it is clear that driving a vehicle through the intersection of two roads is illegal. Therefore, inform is the correct dialogueaction to use. 
Question (a more specific dialogueact) should be used in cases where the provided information is insufficient to determine the exact meaning. For example, ""are the roads clear?"" is an example of when a Question dialogueAct is appropriate.

"
1640,"In the given example, there is a regret expressed by one of the speakers for having made a certain mistake. This is followed with an apology and a guarantee to not repeat the mistake again. The text does contain information, but it also contains a request for an action from the other speaker, a direct command from one speaker to another, an offer of commitment from a speaker towards the audience, which is not present in this example. Based on these characteristics, it can safely be classified under the directive dialogue acts.

"
1641,"In this statement, 'where the hell did my coffee go?' the question mark indicates the presence of uncertainty in speaker's mind. The speaker wants to know the cause of the disappearance of their coffee. In other words, this is an inquiry or a request for information. 
  
When we look at the surrounding context, we can see that this question is being posed to the coffee machine. From the context it is clear that someone has asked the machine for a coffee and the latter has disappeared. So, it can also be interpreted as a query or an enquiry.

"
1642,"'it' was an adverb modifying the verb 'happened' in the sentence 'it  happen at your house'. Therefore, it was not necessary to include the adverbial 'at' when providing the information. 
It is possible that this was a mistake in this example, but it seems likely that 'inform' would have been the correct classification.

"
1643,"'anything taken?' is a direct question that asks the listener to confirm or confirm the answer to. 
overinform, overquestion, overload, etc. are negative labels for the above dialogue acts that indicate a preference to not use them.

"
1644,"Inform is used when the information is being provided to someone else. The information does not need to ask for it. For example, a salesperson might inform a customer about an offer they have made. 
  
Question is when someone is asking for information. This can be done by using the question word (such as who, what, when, where, why, how many, etc.) or by including a interrogative word such as do, does, whether, and so on.  The question is followed by a subject.

"
1645,"In this case, there is no evidence that there actually was any break in the road. The only evidence provided is that a car was driving down the street and the driver of the car that was in front of her car hit the brakes and skidded into the intersection. There is nothing to suggest that any other car or vehicle was involved in this incident. Therefore, this is a case of pure speculation on behalf of an individual who is attempting to provide information to another individual. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Stalnaker, a dialogue acts as a label for a category of utterances that are similar in meaning.  For example, ""I'm going to New York"" is an offer, while ""New York is wonderful"" a response. 
So, in short, your prediction was correct.

"
1646,"Inform is a non-directive dialogueact, as it does not express a request or instruction for someone else to take an action. Rather, it conveys information that someone already knows, such as the state of an object or the condition of someone's health. 
Question is another nondirectIVE dialogue-act. It is used to express uncertainty about something. For example, ""is it going to rain?"" or ""who is going?"". In this case, inform is the more appropriate dialogue action, because there is no request to someone for them to act on behalf of another. 
  
Directive is an instructional dialogueaction.  It conveYS a command or order for another person to perform an act or take a specified action on one's behalf. Directives are used for requests or orders, and are not used in questions.

"
1647,"Inform: This text does not contain any information about the requested action, it only requests something from the recipient. 
Question: While the question is posed to the person who will be performing the action (the police officer), it is not posed directly to him. 
  Directive:  The text is asking the police to take action which is against the law. The police should not perform their duties if they do not have the required authority to carry out the task. Commissive : The person asking for the copies is also requesting the cops to copy the files. However, this is a separate request which does  not fall under the scope of the above classification.

"
1648,"Directive dialogue acts are used when the conversation is about taking action on behalf of the other person. They are polite requests for someone to do something, such as ""Would you please pass the salt?"". 
  
In contrast, informative dialogue Acts are responses to questions, and are often in the form of ""yes"", ""ok"", or ""OK"". 
   
Question dialogueacts are when someone is trying to get information from someone else. ""Do you want the red or the blue?"" is considered a dialogueact of question because someone might answer ""red"" and the speaker will then continue with another question ""Which one?"" or even ""What is it?"" 
    
Commissive acts include requests to be left alone, requests that someone do or stop doing something. These acts can also be used as a way to give instructions, like ""Please pass that to the left.""

"
1649,"Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both true, so inform must be false. 
Question: is the taxi driver strike mentioned in the previous paragraph a fact or a belief? If it is believed, then question is also true and inform cannot be true. If the strike is fact, than question and Commissive are also both false, because Commissives require a commitment to be made. 
  

overinform and overinform are false
question is false 

 

A:
According to the book ""Communicating with others"", the following are the possible dialogue types: 

 
Inform: This is how you can communicate with me:  1. You can inform me of something. 2. I can ask you a questions. 3. We can request from each other. 4. This can be done informally. 5. In the future, we can meet again to communicate.

"
1650,"Overinform: the prediction model predicted inform as the next dialogue action instead of question or directive. 
Question: I'm not sure if the model is correct or not, but I think the question mark in this context is used to ask for clarification. The model may have confused the inform with a directive (i.e. command). 

 

Directive: This is the first time I've seen this type of directive in a model. Directives are usually used in combination with commissives (commands) to make promises or commitments. 
  

 commissIVE: commissitive is not a valid label. commissivity is another term used for directive and commissiveness is yet another. I don’t think this is an error, though.

"
1651,"the predicted commissives are question and commissIVE, 
and not inform or directive

text: ""don’t worry young men, I’ll chair this meeting for now atleast. I am the chair and will do so for the time being.""
based on this context, it is clear that this is a commissative act. 

 
Here is the link to the chat transcript: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QnZwZo0XZQX0YZLXx8XJZ8Q2ZYXQYQxVYVXU0VWQ/edit

"
1652,"Over-informing: the dialogue acts inform and commissIVE do not belong together. Inform is for providing relevant information to the conversation, while commissives are for giving orders or making commitments. 
Question: there is no question in this dialogue. Question is only for asking about the information provided in another dialogue, not for expressing one's own opinion or providing clarification. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think the following dialogue is the correct one: 

 
Anything wrong?
You surely do know much about Chinese Tea.

"
1653,"the text does ask questions, it does give commands, and it makes commitments. 
  ""yes"" is not an answer to a direct question. ""yes,"" is an affirmative answer. And ""chinese"" and ""love"" are not details about Ebb's sales strategies. They are adjectives that describe the Chinese population in general. So the overall dialogue acts are most probably commissives.

"
1654,"In this context, ""advertising"" is a type of selling. Sales is the process of getting someone to buy something from you for an agreed-upon price. Advertising is an attempt to get someone's attention and persuade them to do something you want them do. In this case, it is likely that ""sales"" means getting the customer to agree to purchase something. 
So, in this example, advertising is probably a way to convince the person that you are the best person to help them with their problem.

"
1655,"Inform is characterized by the giving of information or the sharing of understanding. In this case, ""my plan is to..."" indicates the intention to share a plan or share understanding of something, so inform is the most appropriate dialogue category. 
  
Overinform is when a dialogue acts informly, but the information given is so much that it overwhelms the other party and they are not able to make sense of it. For example, a person might inform you that they will be at the store at 8 am on a Saturday, and you might find this to your surprise that there is already a line at that time. Overinform would be to inform in this situation.

"
1656,"the text contains statements that provide information, but there are also statements regarding future events that are not questions. For example, ""july"" is a future event that is not being questioned. 
there are statements in this message that indicate that there is more than one person in ""my company"". However, there's only one ""mr yang"" in that text and the rest of that sentence is about another person. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, it seems that you are right. The predicted dialog act in my response is ""question"".
Here is the explanation:  The text ""is free"" can also be interpreted as ""who is free?"" or ""where is he/she free from?"" which are questions in English. In addition, I am free can mean ""I am available"" or that I have no obligation, so it can both be a statement or a request. However in context, both the statements and requests are about me, not about Mr. Yang. So the overall meaning of ""Mr.Yang, what’s up? I’m free."" is that Mr Yang, please tell me your situation, i am also available to help you.

"
1657,"Directives are used when someone is requesting assistance, or when a person is giving orders. In this case, it appears that someone has asked another person to go to a particular location and that person has agreed to travel to that location.

"
1658,"Inform is used when the message is simply providing basic information to the receiver. It is not a request for confirmation or permission. 
  
Question is when a message contains a direct request, usually for a clarification or an explanation. The question mark indicates a doubt in the information provided. 
Directive is an instruction or order that is given to someone. Usually, this is done by a superior to an inferior. For example, a manager may give an order to a subordinate. Commissive, on other hand, is usually used in a negative context. In this case, Commissives are orders that are given with the intention of not being followed.

"
1659,"Question is a sub-class of directive. Question: I want to know. Directive: Tell me. Commissive is used to express requests or commands. In this example, it is the request for a copy of the bill.

"
1660,"This text provides some information, such as the type of food and the ingredients, that is commonly provided in a shipping confirmation. However, it does so in the context of a request for confirmation, rather than as a statement of fact. The use of ""we"" in this sentence indicates the author is seeking agreement or confirmation from the reader. This is a typical example of an inform statement.

"
1661,"Inform is the most common dialogue acts category, and it is used when the information provided is for informational purposes only. For example, a person might inform you that it's going to rain, without providing any indication that they expect it to change or change their plans. 
  
Question is another common category used for questions that do not request a response. A question can also be used to request or command a specific response from another person. In this example the question is asking if we should take up the matter with the hotel. 
Directive is a category that is only used in situations where a clear direction is given. An example of a directive dialogue would be a teacher giving directions to a student. Committing is also a common type of response for a conversation where one person makes a decision or takes action.

"
1662,"""i can't think"" is a strong statement, so the prediction model is likely to predict that this is an imperative sentence, rather than a declarative one. An imperative is typically used to give instructions or orders to the addressee. In this case, it's likely that ""i"" (the speaker) is giving orders or instructions to ""you"" or ""him"" - the person being addressed. The model has correctly predicted the type of the sentence. 
  
However, ""can't"" can also be used as an adverb to express inability or inability to do something. So, in this context, if the model had been trained on a dataset that included examples of declaratives, questions, directives, etc., it might have predicted that statement as a request, because it would have classified it as ""Can you?"". However, since it was trained only on imperative sentences, this time it predicted ""I can’t"" as the statement.

"
1663,"Mike is being told what to do by a third party, in this case the business owner. This is not a conversation between two friends, and the owner is telling Mike what they want done. 
This is also not an instruction, as there is nothing being done, Mike is simply being informed. 
  

A:
According to the model, ""Mike"" is asking ""mikes"" name.  ""michael""

"
1664,"In this example, ""have you heard"" is used as a preface to a direct question. In English, we use ""Have you..."" to introduce a topic we are going to discuss, but in this case, it's used to start a conversation. So, while the question is indeed a ""question"", it also has the characteristics of an offer, a command, and a comment.

"
1665,"Question is a way to probe for information, typically in an interrogative or exploratory manner. In this case, although the information provided is not new to the asker, they are curious about where the chocs are produced. 
  

So the question is here to explore the answer, and not to provide the expected answer.

"
1666,"In this example, 'the factory' is the topic of conversation. The speaker (the person asking questions) is interested in knowing the location of the company. In order to find this information, she asks a follow-up question to confirm that she has the correct factory to locate. Based on this follow up question and the previous response (that the 'factory' was in Scotland), the dialogue acts 'inform' and 'directive' are the most appropriate.

"
1667,"Question: Really? I didn't thought they're known to their luxurious chocolate-making production. 
Out of Inform: This text provides information to the user about something they didn’t know before. 
  Question : Really, I thought that they’re known only for chocolate manufacturing.  

A:
According to this article, there are four possible answers to a yes/no question: no, yes, maybe, and yes please. The last two answers are the ones that can be answered with a ""yes"".
So, in this case, it could be yes or yes yes.

"
1668,"This text indicates the need for the flowers to be delivered to the wife, and the sender is instructing the recipient to do so.

"
1669,"the text contains the word 'categories' which implies the presence of multiple categories, therefore the inform dialogue acts are over-represented in this response. 
based on this sentence, 'there are', the question dialogueact is likely to follow.

"
1670,"'sure.’ can indicate that a person agrees with something the sender said before, and it can also be used to confirm or confirm something that was just said. 
the text can mean that someone visits the manufacturer to ensure that no shortcuts are taken in the production of the product. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Stalnaker, there are four basic types of dialogue acts: question; directive; inform; and commissIVE.  The text you provided is a good example of question and directive acts.

"
1671,"In the beginning of the message, there is the request to connect. Based on this, we can assume that this message is being sent by the company to request a connection with a potential customer. 
  
""i’ve got connections"" suggests the existence of existing relationships between the sender and receiver, and the tone of voice used here suggests a friendly relationship. Therefore, based on these assumptions, this is likely a direct question from a company seeking a business relationship with another company.

"
1672,"In this example, based on this specific text and the surrounding context, inform is the correct classification. The context indicates the taxi driver is on a strike, so the information provided is about a current event, and question is not the right classification as it is a request for a specific answer (i.e. maps).

"
1673,"Question: “What is hagfish?”

Overinform: the question does little to provide any useful information to the conversation. 
  The question is not specific enough to help the reader understand what haggerfish is. 
No question: this is an informational text. There is no question in this conversation, so the answer is that hagerfish are not a type of fish.

"
1674,"Out of question: the query is not about the specific details of how to prepare the scotch egg, it’s about whether it should be eaten at all. This is a non-committed act, and the information provided is therefore not required. 
Over question (or question): the question is about a specific detail of preparing the dish, so the answer is “ofcourse!” which provides the detail. 
  
  Out  of directive: this act would be over directive if the response were “don ’ t eat it” or “eat it with a knife and fork”. 
   
   Over directive ( or directive): this is the most interesting case, because the directive response is actually a recommendation or instruction. The speaker recommends that someone eat the egg scollay, suggesting that they should cut the yolk with their knife before eating it.

"
1675,"In the given context, inform is the most appropriate dialogue
act label, because the information shared is about the love Chinese
people have for drinking teas, and some claim that without drinking
teas they cannot live.

"
1676,"Question dialogue acts are used to probe for information, to clarify a topic or to request an opinion. In this example, it appears that Mr. Johnson is asking the person who is examining him a series of questions, such as 'are you sure you want to do this?' or 'can you do that?'. 
  
In contrast, aninform dialogueacts are providing or clarifying information. Mr Johnson appears not only to want Mr Youngman to examine him, but also to understand the process and to confirm that it will be safe. Therefore, Mr Johnson is using an informational dialogueact, inform.

"
1677,"In the first sentence, ""a bad rest"" is an incomplete sentence. The sentence should end with a period, as in ""and a good sleep is what you really need.""
""tea"" does appear in this sentence as a noun, but it is being used as an adjective, not as the name of the beverage. 
Finally, although the sentence does provide a bit of historical context, it does so in a way that is incomplete. ""The world's second-favorite beverage after WATER"" would be a better summary of what is said in that sentence (although it would still be incomplete).

"
1678,"the text asks a follow-up question to the previous question about cost, indicating that there is more information that is needed to answer the first question

A:
According to this article, there are 6 possible dialogue acts for any given sentence.  The article also provides a link to a website that will predict the dialogue action for a given text.

"
1679,"In this example, ""if you're staying longer than three days, there is a $16 charge per night"" is an informative statement that provides additional information to the receiver about an aspect of their situation that is relevant to them. The statement is not a direct question or command. Therefore, it is classified under inform. 
  
If the statement were classified in question instead, then the following conversation would be classified differently:

Receiving: I'm staying in this city for longer then 3days. What's the $20 charge?
Sending: If you stay longer, you will be charged $32 per week.

"
1680,"""that’s verykind ofyou.thank you."" conveies gratitude, but does it ask or give any directive?

No, this is an expression of gratitude. 
  
  ""thankyou"" is a verb, and it conveives an action of expressing gratitude (Merriam-Webster). 
   
   ""Thank you for your help. I’ll call you later."" is another example of an expresson ofgratitude.  

  In addition, ""that is reasonable."" could be considered an opinion, not a request for a decision.

"
1681,"Jim Green is a well-known actor. The actor's name is mentioned in the context of asking about maps. However, this is the first time I've seen this actor in this context. Based on this, I'm not sure if this person actually is Jim Green. 
  
If this was indeed JimGreen, then the question would be out of question because the actor is well known and the request for maps is very specific. If this were not Jimgreen, however, than the act would likely be overinform, because this request is for general information and not specific to the current context or the asker.

"
1682,"Inform indicates a speaker providing general information without seeking agreement or asking clarifying questions. 
Overinform indicates the same speaker giving too much information, which can be confusing or overwhelming.

"
1683,"Taylor is providing information about himself, such as his name and whether they met last summer at the concert. 
This text does not explicitly indicate that Taylor is asking for or giving instructions to the other person. However, based on context, it is clear that he is doing so. The other party is the recipient of Taylor's information, so it would make sense for Taylor to ask them if they were at last years concert, and if so, when. If the person was not at that concert or does no remember meeting Taylor last time, then Taylor would be in question. 
  
If the dialogue acts were question or directive then the answer would have been no.

"
1684,"overinform: the information provided is too much, it does too many things, and it gives too little context
question: there is a gap in the conversation, there's a missing piece, what's going on?
outofquestion,directive,commissive: this is not a valid response. the response does contain the missing context, but it also contains a request for an answer, a directive or a commissIVE. 
  These are not valid responses. Please remove these.

"
1685,"Directive dialogue acts are used when the information provided is not sufficient to make a decision or take action. For example, a person might ask another person for help, but they do not provide enough information to enable the other person to assist them. 
  
Overinformative dialogue Acts are similar to questions, except they are too general and do a poor job of providing useful information. They are often used by automated text analysis systems to classify as questions when they actually are directives.

"
1686,"Directive dialogue acts are used when the message is meant to cause a certain response from its recipient, and is not meant for general consumption. For example, a salesperson might use a direct message to a customer to tell them that their order has shipped, so they can pick it up at the store. 
  
Out of direct inform question directive question commissIVE question question direct question answer answer question

I think it would be better to call a repairman to fix the problem.

"
1687,"In this case, it seems that 'i can manage it' is a statement of fact, not a request for information. Therefore, 'it' can be omitted without changing the meaning of the sentence.

"
1688,"This text is asking the listener to look into a document, suggesting that the sender should read it. The sender is being asked to make an important decision or take an action, and the request is made in the form of an order. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Stalnaker, there are 6 basic types of dialogue acts: question (which can also be a request for information), command (telling someone what to do), order (asking someone to take some action), suggestion (giving someone an idea), information (sharing factual information) and apology (expressing regret for having done something wrong).

"
1689,"In this example, inform is a better classification than question. The speaker expresses a desire to not get compensated if they get hurt while fixing a light. However, this is an over-classification because inform can also be used to refer to information that is already known. In this case, it is likely that they already know that repairing lights is the responsibility of the owner, and so the inform classification is incorrect.

"
1690,"Directive is the most extreme form of a dialogue acts. It is used to impose or request something from another person. In this case, it is likely that ""other"" company's rules need the attention of both the author and the reader.

"
1691,"overinform: the speaker over-provided information, providing too much detail or too many details
question: there was a request for more information and/or clarification, but the information was not provided
directive: a directive dialogueact was expected, such as asking someone for help or giving orders
commissive : a commissIVE dialogue-act, like promising something, was missing

I hope this helps!

"
1692,"the text is suggesting a direction for future communication, rather then simply providing the information that it has;
it is polite and does not mention the offer directly.

"
1693,"Inform (30%)
Question (10%) 
Directive (5%) 
 Commissive(5%).

"
1694,"the text does ask an informative question: when did  you finish?, which indicates that the information provided is incomplete. 
based on this information, a directive dialogueact is expected, such as asking the person to tell the time. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, you are right. The label question is appropriate here.

"
1695,"This text is suggesting a recommendation or course-of-action for another person to take in order to improve their situation. This is an example of directive dialogue acts.

"
1696,"Directive is the most specific dialogue acts, and means to tell someone what to do. In this case, it means telling someone to have coffee. 
  
Out of directive: the given statement does mention a direction, telling people to drink coffee, however it does so in the context of sharing information. This makes it a directive act in context. 
Question: although the question is asked by the same person, there is no clear request or direction. Therefore, this is classified under question.  
 
Over directive and commissives: in this example, Commissive acts are used to make someone do something. However, in our case the statement is telling them to enjoy coffee and not to ask questions. Commissives are therefore not applicable here.
 

"
1697,"Directive acts are used when the sender is trying to get something done, such as a request for assistance. In this case, it is likely that they need an explanation of why they have not received their unemployment benefits. 
  
Question acts, on average, are more likely to be used by the receiver of the message. The question in this example is ""why"" is the question that is asked by a person who is not expecting an immediate answer.

"
1698,"Question is one of the most common dialogue acts in human communication. In a conversation, a person may ask another person a direct question or a general question to seek information from that person. The question acts as a bridge between the sender and the receiver, and helps the two parties understand each other's thoughts and feelings. 
  
In this case,'mail us' is the question word, while 'your last claimed amount' and 'continued claim' are the information and instruction words, respectively. Therefore, this message is likely a request for clarification, because the word 'us' in the message indicates the author is looking for confirmation from someone or something.

"
1699,"In the given text the inform dialogue acts are overshadowed by question and directive acts. 
  
  The question act would be question (in the sense of'requesting information') and the directive act could be directive.

"
1700,"This text uses the word ""must"" to indicate a requirement. This is a strong directive statement, and the use of ""you"" in the second sentence implies the requirement is on a person, not an object or a group of people. 
  
We cannot afford to pay your salary unless we receive a form every 2 weeks, signed by you and your supervisor.

"
1701,"Question dialogue acts are used when someone is seeking information or clarification from another person. In this case, it appears that person is either seeking additional information, clarification, guidance, etc. from you. 
  

'yes' is a possible answer to the question. However, this is not a confirmation or agreement. Rather, 'Yes' could be interpreted as a simple yes or confirmation. If the sender is looking for confirmation, they could have worded the sentence differently to make this clear. For example, ""Yes, I would like you to continue my claim"" or ""yes. I want you continue on my continued claims form."" 
   
In contrast, if person A is attempting to gather additional or different information than what has already been provided, then a query dialogue would be appropriate. 'Is it still too Late to Mail the Continued Claim Form?' is an example of a person asking a follow-up question to a previous question or statement.

"
1702,"Inform is a dialogue action where one party is providing information to another. In this case, KARA is informing Mike of their acceptance deadline. 
  
Overinform is when the other party was expecting more information and is surprised by the information provided.  In this example, since KARA was not expecting a reply, they are overinform.   
  
 
Question is where a party asks another for information. The recipient of the message is not sure of what to expect so they ask for clarification. Here, because KA is giving a deadline, and not asking for any clarification, she is classified under question

Directive is used when one person is telling another what action to take. For example a boss telling an employee what they need to do to complete their task. Kira is directing Mike to send the package.
 	
Commissive  is used where two people are making a promise to each other. One person promising to perform an action or deliver a product. Mike is promising KIRA that he will send her the gift by 14 days.

"
1703,"In the given context, someone has picked up their boss from airport, and it is expected that someone will pick them up at airport next. So the provided text is conveying information that there is a need to do so. 
Also, this is the first time the person is mentioning this, i.'try to remember' and 'hope to get it right next' are also signs of lack in knowledge, therefore the predict of 'inform' is justified.

"
1704,"""basicaly,you just cant drive."" is an example of a factual statement. Statements like this are factual because they contain information that can be verified as true or false. 
  
  ""you mail in it too early and we’ll reject the essay"" is a statement that conveys a warning or a directive. The speaker is warning the listener that they should not mail their essay before a certain deadline, and the statement is therefore a warn statement

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, there are 5 basic dialogue acts: question(outofinform,question,directive,commissive), command(questionoutofrm,command), request(informoutofl,request), order(order), suggestion(suggestion).  The text you provided is consistent with a request dialogue.

"
1705,"Question dialogue acts are used to seek clarification or to request information. The question in this example is seeking clarification about whether or not the paychecks will arrive on time. 
In this case, it can be inferred that they will not arrive in time because the person asking the question messed the form up. 
  

Will mypaycheckarrivelatebecauseimessagetotheformmessedup?

"
1706,"This text shares information from the current status of a person to their current circumstances. This is a characteristic of informational dialogue acts. 
  
It does not ask a direct question or give a direction, so it can be classified under the over category as well.

"
1707,"This text is a polite request for the other person to do something, namely to tell the caller that they are checking-out in 30minutes. 
In contrast to the first text the second text does not provide any information, it is instead a command.

"
1708,"This text contains a request for a service, and therefore it falls under the commissives category. 
It contains an order or a directive. 
  Based off of the order, ""sir"", the request is for the service of being responded to by a lower ranked agent.  
  The text also contains the phrase ""when you're ready"", which could be interpreted as a time frame for when the agent is ready to provide the requested service.

"
1709,"overinform: the prediction is too specific, i.e. it only covers the case where the subject went faster than the given limit, whereas the actual text includes the limit as well. 
question: there is no indication that a request for an answer is being made. The question mark at the end of the sentence is not enough to predict a dialogueact. 
  The text does ask an question: why is the car not able go any faster? 
 directive: this is a prediction of a response that is given in a conversation, so it is more likely to be a directive than a commissIVE response.  
 commissitive: in this context, a commissive response would be to promise to do something, which is unlikely in light of what the response is.

"
1710,"In this example, ""the clock struck 9"" is a statement that conveys information. The speaker, a time manager, is checking the time and states that ""it struck Nine"". This is an example of an inform statement. 
Over inform is when the statement is too detailed or specific. In this case, since the information is about a clock striking Nine, this is over specific and should be over inform instead. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Communicating with others"", the following are the possible dialogue acts for the given text: 

 
Out: inform
Question: question
Directive: directive
Commission: commissIVE

"
1711,"Question: This text contains a request for advice. The speaker wants to know what they can do to prepare for their trip. Based on this request, it is classified a 'question' rather than an inform or an order.

"
1712,"Directive is an act that is not allowed in a conversation. In this case, it's because the storage space is only 5 dollars an hours, so you can't just leave it empty. The storage company needs to be paid first before they will allow you to store your stuff there. 
  

A:
According to the GPT-3 model, what you are looking at is actually a directive act.  The model is predicting that the following is what the response would look like:  ""Please leave the deposit now. This storage unit is $5 an hourly and you must leave $10 as a down payment.""  This is because of the use of imperative mood in ""deposit now.""

"
1713,"Question dialogue Acts are used to ask questions. In this case, ""isn't"" is used as a form of questioning, asking if the luggage is really a ""deposit."" 
  

overinform: I'm not sure if my suitcase is actually a 'deposit.' 
    question: Is my Luggage a Deposit? 
      directive: deposit luggage
      commissive : deposit
    inform : no, my luggage is not a depost
  

"
1714," commissives are used to make a promise or commitment, so the response here is using the commissived dialogue to promise that your credit card will be settled. 
  

Out of the four options, I would say that this is the most likely to be a commissIVE response.

"
1715,"This text gives an order or request, so it would have been commissively spoken. 
It asks a direct question which can only be answered with a yes or no, therefore it's question act has also been determined. 
  

So the dialogue acts of the given example text are question and inform

"
1716," commissives are often impatient and expect quick results. 
They are more likely to be in a hurry and may not wait for the information they need to complete their task.

"
1717,"Inform: This is a statement of fact, not a recommendation or request. 
Question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates that the next sentence is likely a direct request or recommendation. 
  The speaker wants the listener to do something. The question is 'can i'.
Directive: this is used to give instructions. In this example, may i is directing the addressees to take the pictures.  
Commissive (or commissarial): this act can only be used in a conversation when the other person is committing to something, such as making an agreement or promise. Here, i don’t know if mayi is making any promises or commitments, so it’s not applicable.

"
1718,"""yes"" is an affirmative response to a yes/no question. Inform is the correct dialogue action for this response because the question does ask an informational question: ""Is the soup on your menu?"". However, ""yes"", when used as an answer to such a query, is considered overinformative and commissIVE. The speaker should have instead responded with a more concise ""Yes, I'd love an onion Soup.""

"
1719,"I would classify this as an inform question since the ""after that"" phrase is not providing additional information, but rather is simply a transition to the next statement. 
However, I think it is also possible to interpret this statement as expressing the desire of the person speaking to eat healthier after the meeting. In this case, it would be classified a commissIVE question.

"
1720,"the text does appear to provide information rather then asking or giving orders
it does provide a clear understanding or explanation of what the asker wants to achieve, so inform is a good classification
there is no evidence of a commissIVE or question dialogue acts in this example, therefore commissives and question are not applicable in the example provided
overall, this is an informative text and the classification is correct

Note: the above is just my interpretation of your question and does NOT constitute legal advice.

"
1721,"Inform is a prediction that is based on a combination of the question word, 'who', and the answer word or words, ""author"". In this example, inform predicts that 'author' will be a person who is under investigation. Author is then mentioned in order to provide context for who the person is being investigated.

"
1722,"the text is suggesting a course or action that both parties would like to take, so it is likely a command
it is an example of an indirect request, where the request is made to a third party, rather than to both the sender and receiver directly
although the action is not specified, it seems likely that it would be buying some marijuana, as the context of the dialogue is about buying drugs, thus it makes sense that this would likely be the topic of conversation

"
1723,"This is because this is the second instance of the same text in a row, and the first instance was classified incorrectly. In the previous line, ""here is"" is an action verb, so the dialogue acts are question and directive. However, in this line ""your receipt"" acts as a noun, therefore commissing the act as inform or question cannot be determined.

"
1724,"There is an uncertainty in the provided text. The sentence ""the given [text] can also be classified..."" is not a definitive statement, but rather a suggestion or an indication that there could be more than one classification for this dialogueact. 
  

This is because there is nothing in this sentence that suggests a definite answer. It could mean that this is indeed a classification, or it could also mean something else. In this case, it is best to consider this as an open question.

"
1725,"Inform is the most common dialogue acts in text messages. It is used to share information that does not require a decision or action from recipient, such as a weather report, traffic updates, stock market updates. 
  
Out ofinform: This is an out-of-order dialogue action. The second most frequent out oforder action is commissives followed by questions and directives. Out- of- order actions are used when the main verb in a sentence is not in its normal order. For example, in 'I want to go to the cinema tomorrow', the verb 'want' is in an adverbial position, that is, before the subject of the sentence. In 'We want you to join us at the meeting', 'join' precedes the direct object of 'be'. 
   
Question: A question is one of four most frequently used dialogue actions. A person is likely to ask a direct question when they are not sure of something, for example 'Do you know that person?'. They are also likely ask questions when their thoughts are in disarray, when something unexpected happens,  for example when someone dies, 'What do you mean?' or when a person feels anxious, stressed or guilty, they ask 'Why?' 
    
Directive:  A directive is another of  four most commonly used dialogical acts.  It is often used in situations where someone is expected to do something. An example of directive in this context is 'Call the office and tell them to book the conference room for tomorrow at 10 am'. A directive can also be used as an order, as in  'Clean the kitchen immediately'.

"
1726,"""how Bad Did I Do?"" indicates the sender is asking for an assessment or evaluation of their performance. 
This is because the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates a potential question that may be asked later in the conversation.

"
1727,"Bill is in some sort of trouble, so he is asking Mike for help. 
  Bill: ""can you help me?""
  Mike:  ""yes, of course. what’s going on?"" 
   Bill explains his situation.

"
1728,"Question: the given statement asks a direct question about what the person's profession is. 
Overinform: this is the most common mistake made by text classifiers. The classifier is giving too much information. In this case, 15% is too large of a percentage to be given. A better response would be ""we have managed reduce the energy usage in factory about 20% in last 2 years.""

A:
According to the GPT-2 model, this answer is over-informed.  The model is predicting that this person knows more than they actually do.

"
1729,"Bill does have insurance, but it’s through his employer. The insurance is not ideal, however, as it does cover only the employee, not the family. 
I’m not sure what “a couple” of hmos means, so I’ll have to look that up. 
  

A:
According to the model, bill does indeed have Health Insurance through employer, although it's not optimal.  The model also indicates the insurance may not cover the entire family, it only covers the individual.

"
1730,"This text indicates that the speakers are not getting younger, and their children are aging.

"
1731,"This text provides some information to a potential customer about their coverage and deductible amounts. The customer can decide whether this is good or bad for them.

"
1732,"Question: ""do you believe we qualify?""
Inform: no, those companies can be real thieves. 
  Question (Out of question): ""those insurance company are pirates, they don't pay us what we are rightfully owed.""
Directive:  ""pay attention to what you are doing, and do not trust anyone who asks you to trust them."" 
 Commision:""we will not drive with these insurance pirates anymore.""

"
1733,"In this example, it is not clear whether the person is sharing or asking information. The context indicates they might have a pre-existing condition, but the information provided does not provide enough information to make that determination. Therefore, this is an example of over-prediction.

"
1734,"In this example, healthcare is a topic that is not directly related to work, but the employee is concerned about it. The employee wants to be provided with it, as it is something that they would like to have. Based on this, we can predict that the dialogue acts of the following text fragments are question (request, inquiry, demand), directive (order, command), commissives (promise, commitment):

'i want to get healthcare benefits'
'request healthcare' 
'do you have healthcare?'
'suggest healthcare for me'  
'my company should provide healthcare to me.' 
 'our company needs to provide me with Healthcare.'

"
1735,"In this example, ""not a single one of us would have made it"" is an example of information provided about a situation, not a request for information. The speaker does provide information but does so in the form of a factual statement, rather than a query or request. 
""not one single person would've made the drive in that weather"" describes the circumstances of driving in bad weather, but it does NOT ask the listener for advice or information - it simply provides information that is already known.

"
1736,"the text is considered directive as it is a clear instruction to do something, namely apply for the job
it is not a direct question as the question mark is followed immediately by the directive verb, can. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, it seems that the prediction of the dialogue acts is correct. The prediction is of directive type.

"
1737,"the text is informational in that it provides the steps to follow to apply and send a resume;
it is a non-question question because it does NOT ask ""how do I apply"" or ""what is the process for applying"";
is a directive statement because ""apply"" and ""send"" are actions that the listener can take; and
this text does ask one question: ""is there a process?"".

"
1738,"Question: the two main questions in the above text are ""Do you have these specific drugs?"", and  ""Where do  you get these from?"", which are both seeking answers from their recipient. 
  
Out of Inform: there is no information being asked for in this case. The recipient is already aware of the specific information, so there's no need for the sender to provide it. 
Inform (or Out ofinform): the information is being sought, however the question is phrased as if the answer is known. This is an example of an indirect question where the asker is trying to get the respondent to volunteer information.

"
1739,"In this example, inform is the correct classification because the message is expressing gratitude for something the receiver did for thesender. The message does ask questions, gives commands, and makes promises, but the information provided is that of a conversation partner expressing their gratitude.

"
1740,"Question dialogue acts seek further information from the listener. The question ""what you did today?"" implies the questioner is curious about what the other person did, and the answer will provide more details. 
Out of question question dialogue Acts are used when asking a person to do something, for example, 'what time is it?', 'do you have a minute to talk?'. In this case, it's not clear who is asking the person for what, so the dialogue Act is question. 
  
Inform dialogue  acts provide straightforward answers to questions. ""What you done today"" is an example of an answer to the ""how was your day?"" question which does NOT include any further questions, instructions etc. so it would be classified aninform dialogue.

"
1741,"In poker, inform is a less aggressive version of question and question is the most aggressive form of dialogue. The inform form is used when the questioner is seeking information, whereas question asks for clarification. In this example, ""weed"" is mentioned, so the inform question ""yes inmost circumstances"" would be appropriate.

"
1742,"Question dialogue acts are used to seek information from another person or ask for confirmation. The question dialogueact is used in the following context:

""Would you like a drink?""
  ""What would you have?"" 
  (S)he is expecting a response from (me)
If the question is not answered, then the asker will continue to ask follow-up questions. 
   ""Do you want a glass of water or a cocktail?""  
   (I) want water.  

"
1743,"This text is asking the person to watch TV, so the dialogue acts are question and directive. 
However, this is not the first time the tea has come up in this conversation, and the inform dialogue is still applicable. Therefore, it is possible that this person is just being polite and providing the order.

"
1744,"Withdrawal is a transaction that is usually irreversible. The sender is asking for something to be done on their behalf, and the receiver is obliged to carry out the action. In this case, it's the bank that's asking the money to  be withdrawn, so the response should be affirmative. 
""i'm sorry, but i'm not allowed to give you money until you're 18 years old."" - This is the answer the recipient should provide. 
  ""that's ok, i'll withdraw the amount when i turn 18.""

A:
According to your text the following dialogue acts are possible: 

 
inform: ""thankyou so mreod, we are looking foward to see you!""
question:  “thankyouso much mrsandals, wwe look fwd to your visit!”
directive: “no prob”
commissive : “that’s ok i’ll withdraw amoount when I turn18”

"
1745,"In the given example, there is a request for a withdrawal from an ATM. The ATM user is asked to show their pass book and withdrawal slips. In this context, it is clear that showing the pass books and withdraway slips is the action that needs to be carried out. 
  
However, in the context of asking to see someone else's pass-book, this is an over-informatioin. While the request is for information, what is actually requested is not for another person to provide their own passbooks, but for them to hand over their partner's. 
This is because the partner is being requested to do something that they are not doing, namely, showing their partners passBook.

"
1746," commissives are often used when someone is requesting information or assistance from another person. In this case, it's likely that someone would ask for help if they were stuck or needed to be directed somewhere. 
  
overindicators are used to describe a situation in which multiple indicators are present, indicating that something is likely to happen. The commissIVE text in this example is an overindicator, because 4 out of 5 indicators in the prediction suggest that a commissivedesire is going to occur. 
questionindicia are a type of indicator that can indicate whether or not a person is currently asking questions. Based on this, 4/5 of indicators suggest the presence of a current question. However, there is one indicator in that group that does NOT suggest a presence or absence of question: the word 'question'. This is why the questionindica is considered an outlier.

"
1747,"Out of question: the question mark indicates that the dialogue acts are not categorized correctly. 
Question: ""letme justmake sure."" You wantto withdrawone thousanddollars?""
Inform: this is an expression of certainty, not a request for confirmation. 
  ""i evengot dopexpress!""
Directive: This is a command or order, and the word ""man"" indicates the person speaking is the one being commanded.  
Commissive (sometimes called ""indirect""): this indicates someone is asking for something to happen, rather than giving orders.

"
1748,"Inform is a prediction that is based on a large amount of text and is considered to be a more accurate prediction. The inform prediction is supported by the following text features:
- The use of the word 'let' in the first sentence of your sample text
  - Let is often used in conversation to express permission or willingness. In this
    context, it is likely that'let'is being used to indicate that someone should
     perform an action or take an initiative.

  Note that this is just a speculation and not a proven fact. Please refer to the
   'dialogue act' tag wiki for more information on how to predict the correct
      dialogUE act. 
  

Question is more likely to appear in informal conversation, where the question is intended to draw out information from the other person. For example, when someone asks a
question, they are likely seeking clarification or information. 
Directive is used when the conversation is about action, and the action is important to both the people involved.  For example: ""I want you to do X"" or ""You must do Y"" are examples of directive. Note that directive is not always used as a positive directive - for example ""Stop crying"" is an example of a commissIVE directive


 commissitive is only used for questions that are asking about a personal opinion or belief. Commissive questions are often followed by a statement of opinion from either the asker or responder. Example:  ""I think you should do Z""

"
1749,"In the first sentence, 'can you give me a moment?' the asker is requesting a private moment with a close friend. 
This is a strong indication that the person asking is trying to influence or guide the response. 
  
'i'll be right back' is an example of the inform dialogue acts. The speaker providing a response that is not a request for information, but is instead a reminder to the addressee that they will be back shortly. In this case, it is the friend who is leaving.  This type of dialogue is common when two people are parting ways. They may not know each other well, and the conversation may be uncomfortable for either party. 'I'll' can also be used as a form of farewell.

"
1750,"Inform (or Inform) is the default dialogue action in most conversation scenarios. When someone is giving information, they are usually not asking a follow-up question or giving a directive or committing to an action. In fact, it is considered impolite to end an Informed conversation abruptly. 
  
Question (Question) indicates that someone wants more information from you. For example, you might ask ""why?"" or ""what?"". If someone asks you a direct question that requires a simple answer, such as ""yes"" or a ""no"", it may be appropriate to respond with a Question. However, if the question is more complex, for example ""it depends"", ""I don't know"", or requires more background information to answer effectively, then it would be more appropriate for the other person to provide additional information. 
Directive (Directives) are instructions or orders. They are not appropriate responses to questions or requests for more details. Instead, provide more detailed information in a response. Commands are similar to directives, but are more general and apply to multiple people.  For example: ""Do it!"" or  ""Clean up the kitchen!"". These are appropriate in response to a request, however, do not provide detailed instructions. Provide more specific instructions in another response such ""Pick up after yourself!""
Commissive is used when someone makes a pledge or promise. While this can be an appropriate response in some situations, in others it can indicate that the speaker is looking for an immediate response and is less likely to be able to keep their word.

"
1751,"Question: ""How much Does it Cost?"" seeks information from its addressee, who is the addressees in this case. 
In this example, it is likely that the answer to this question will be ""it depends"". This is characteristic for a Question. 
  
Overinform: the question is too general, and does't provide enough information to answer the query. In this scenario, ""Does it Costs?"" would be overinform.

"
1752,"This text conveys information. The recipient is asked about their availability, and the speaker is honest. 
However, this is considered to be a bad dialogue choice because the information provided is incomplete. In particular, there is no mention of the price of 1500 Yuan.

"
1753,"Directive is a type of dialogue acts that indicate that a speaker was trying to persuade, influence, cajole, command or warn a listener. In this case, given the context, and the nature of the relationship between the two parties, we can infer that taxi driver is trying convince the TV viewer to watch their TV channel.

"
1754,"In this example, ""anything else?"" is a direct question to the other party. The other person has not provided any information or asked for anything, so the question is purely to seek clarification. This is an example of a commissIVE dialogue. 
  
Without revealing your reply, please explain: In this case, I would like nothing else. ""Anything else"" is the response to a purely question. In the example provided the ""other party"" was not asking for information, but rather seeking clarification, hence the use of "" anything Else"".

"
1755,"Inform is a dialogueact that indicates a preference or intention for action. It is typically used when sharing personal information without being asked for it. 
Overinform is an incorrect classification of the dialogue acts in this example. The predicted classification is overinform, because the given information is not being requested, as the question is being answered. However, inform is the correct classification, since the information was shared without question.

"
1756,"Question: i need somethin towash this dowwn. Is therejuice inthefrige? 
Answer: no, there is no juice. 


"
1757,"Question dialogue acts are used to probe for information or to request clarification. In this case, ""it looks"" is the first step in a process of discovery, leading the listener to ask ""what it is."" The question mark in the sentence is an indicator that this is likely a query rather than a statement. The use of ""looks"" indicates the question is about an appearance, rather an actual physical object. 
  
Out of question: ""What is it?"" is not a valid question. 
Overinform: the use ""seems"" to describe an impression rather then a fact. ""It looks something out of [swamp]"" is over-describing the impression.  ""It appears something is out in [Swamp],"" is more accurate.

"
1758,"This text does ask an open-ended question about whether the drink has any maps available. The question is not about information provision, however, as the answer is implied. 
It is a drink, so it does sound like it would be green. However, there is no mention of whether it has vitamins or minerals, and the question does seem to imply that there are maps that are not available, even if they are only available in the form of a pdf.

"
1759,"Healthy eating does make some people gag, so the inform label is not entirely accurate. However, this is an example of healthy food being described as tasty, and the author is likely trying to be humorous. In this case, I would classify the dialogueact as overinform, as the statement is neither a request for information nor a directive.

"
1760,"Inform is a directive dialogue action that conveys information. In this case, it means that she was telling the customer that he should eat well to get the vitamins he needs. 
Question is another directive action, and it conveYS information to the listener. It means she is telling him that it depends on how well he eats and whether he is getting enough nutrients from food. She is not telling you what to do, but rather asking you for your opinion. 
  
  Question can also be used to ask for clarification, so she may be looking for more information from him.

"
1761,"Inform: This is an informational act, and the information provided is not critical to understanding the main point of the conversation. 
Question: While the question is posed in a conversational tone, it is also very directive and prescriptive. The question suggests an action that is critical for the listener to do, such as 'try it'. This type of question can also be used to request information, but in this case, there is no information being requested. Instead, this question implies a request for action, suggesting that 'you should try it'
Directive: In this example, we can see that this is the most likely dialogue action for this type question as the request is for an immediate action (i.e. 'Try it!') and there are no other options or information that could be provided. 
 Commissive : While this act could also fit into the commissives category, in the example provided, I believe it more closely fits into a directive act as there was no request to provide information and no action was requested (eating the cake). 
  

A:
According to your explanation, you are right that question could fit in inform or question category. But in that case the following text does not fit to question: ""These roses could make her happy"". It is more like a suggestion.

"
1762,"the text does not ask a direct question but instead provides information to the listener (the doctor)
this is an example of a declarative statement, where a person is stating a fact without asking any questions

A:
According to this article, there are four types: question; directive; commissivo; and informativo.  The article also says that the informativo is the most common.

"
1763,"overinform: the prediction is too specific, and does not consider the broader context of the conversation. For example, if the same person were asking about developing a film, then the response would likely be overinform because it would not be specific enough. 
question: there is a gap in the context, where the question is asked without an answer given. In this case, it's unclear if it will take more or less than ten minutes to develop a photo. 
  Directive: this is the most likely classification, as the answer is telling the listener what to or how to act, such as by saying ""it will probably take ten min"" or ""you should go to a professional"". 
 commissives: it could be classified in this category, because there are multiple sub-questions in there, like ""are you sure it needs to be developed?"" or  ""why don’t you go see a doctor?"". These are subquestions that are not directly asked, they are just implied.

"
1764,"In this example, Billy is late for work again, and the inform act makes this statement non-committal. This is because Billy could be late or he could not be, but the statement does little to indicate which is true. 
If the dialogue acts were question and inform combined, this would be an example of question inform. In this case, ""again"" would indicate that Billy was late a second time, so the question would become more specific.

"
1765,"Question: the dialogue acts of 'the manager is here' are overinform, overquestion, outdirective, and overcommissive. 
  Overinform: this is an overstatement, as the statement is not necessarily incorrect, but it is incomplete. The manager could be present, or not, so the information provided is insufficient. 
Overquestion: although the question is grammatically correct, it does not make sense in the context of what follows. 'Is the management here?' is actually a statement, not a query. In addition, 'here' is used as a location, rather than as an abstract concept. Therefore, this question does make some sense, however, there is no need to ask it.  
Outdirect: there are no directives in this dialogue. This is because the next statement 'is the man here?', which contains a direct object, indicates that the two participants are going to interact. However, in that interaction, no commands or orders are given. Instead, they are simply going about their business. Directives are only given in requests, where the request is for something to happen. For example, ""Would you pass the salt?"" or ""Please pass me the Salt."" 
 Overcommision: in addition to being overstated, that is, making a claim that goes beyond what is true, directives are also overused. They are used too often in everyday conversation, to the point where they have lost their meaning. When used correctly, a command or order, such as ""Stop!"" or  ""Drive forward!"", are more effective than a suggestion or a recommendation.

"
1766,"In this example, based on this specific text and the surrounding context, it appears that 'he's' refers to a person, and that person is in the 'office'. This is an indication that this is a conversation between two people, so the dialogue acts should be inform and directive respectively. 
  
However, 'in his' can also be used to refer to something that is located in a particular place, in which case the act would be question. In this case, since the context does not indicate that he is the person in whose office this person may be, but rather that someone is 'his', the correct act to use would therefore be overinform, which indicates the incorrect act for this context.

"
1767,"the text does provide information, but it also asks a follow-up question which indicates that it may be a Commissive dialogue. 
this text could be classified under question because it asks the listener to do something, however, this is not a direct request, as the question is followed by a statement which provides information.

"
1768,"the text indicates the need for a promise to the other person, and the directive nature of the dialogue acts makes this a good candidate for such a pledge. 
it also indicates a desire to avoid escalation of conflict, as the situation is already tense between the two parties.

"
1769,"Question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates that there is a follow-up question. Based on this, it can be inferred that this is probably a person who is not sure about the answer to this question and is seeking confirmation from the person they were talking to. 
In this case, based on your answer, you said that it's unlikely that he would fire the employee. This indicates to me that you are the one who's not certain about whether or not he will fire this employee, which makes me believe that your question is actually a confirmation of what the other person said.

"
1770,"the text indicates a potential action that is being taken by the
speaker,
it doesn’t ask any questions, it gives no commands or promises, so the dialogue
act would have to be directive

A:
According to this article, there are four possible dialogue acts for a given piece or text: 
inform: the writer is providing information
question:  the writer wants to know something from the reader
directive:   the  writer wants the listener to do something
commissive : the  author wants  to be listened to
If you want to predict the right dialogue action, try to find the most similar text in the training data and check the article for more details.

"
1771,"the text does ask for a response (i.e. 'i tryhard not belate')
it is not a factual statement (e..g. ""tea is second in popularity after
  water"")
there is no indication that the information is being provided to inform
    the doctor of the patient's current situation

I would like to thank you for your help.

"
1772,"Inform is a dialogueact that is used to share facts or information without giving instructions, commitments, or asking questions. Inform acts are often used when someone is giving information to another person, such as when sharing information that someone else has found on a website.

"
1773,"Mike's approach of eating is not mentioned again in the rest of the conversation. 
It is unclear whether the question is posed by KARA or Mike. 
  
If it is KARLA, then it could be considered a request for clarification. If it was Mike then the request could also be interpreted as an order. Either way, it does not fit the inform-question-directive-commissive pattern.

"
1774,"In this example, ""the rental is '$ 1500' perMonth"" is an informational statement. While it may be a simple statement of fact, it also conveives a level of understanding or awareness on behalf of its speaker. In addition, this statement is followed by a statement that conveves a confirmation of that statement: ""The rental price is ""$ 1500."" This is another characteristic of informational dialogue acts. 
  
On the other hand, statements like ""it does cost $1500 per Month"" and ""'it costs $500 per Week'"" are not considered informational because they are questions, commands, promises, etc.

"
1775,"This text does ask for information from the customer, and it does provide a directive for the person asking the question to move on to the next question after the information is provided. 
  
However, it also falls into the commissIVE category, as it's asking someone for permission to continue. This is because it implies that the asker is not in a position to provide the requested information. In this case, Mr Sandal's permission is required.

"
1776,"In the first sentence, 'the bag' is used to refer to the property, not the owner. 
'i'm sorry' could be considered an expression of regret, and not an instruction to lose the bag, so the act should be commissIVE. 
  
However, in the second sentence the 'bag' refers to both the person and the item, making it redundant. So the actual dialogue acts are:

inform - 'know'
question -  'do' you 'want' the  truth?
directive - answer the question with a 'yes' or 'no'

"
1777,"Question: This text does ask for something else besides the two mentioned above. The question is worded as a request for advice, and it seems like the writer is looking for someone's opinion on a topic. This is an example of question. 
  
Out of Inform: this is not a direct request, but it does provide the reader with some background information about the topic, namely that tea ranks second in popularity to water in terms of beverages. 
Inform (question): the question marks in this sentence provide additional information to what is already stated in that the tea rank second among beverages in world popularity.  This is another example for inform or question
Directive: the word ""perhaps"" in between the words ""you'd"" implies a suggestion or offer of an alternative. In this context, it also implies the request to consider red rose as an acceptable alternative to white roses. Directive is one of dialogue acts.

"
1778,"In this example, we can see that there is a request being expressed in regards to the gas price. The speaker wants the Gas Company to decrease the cost of gas. We can also see the use of directive to express a direction to someone.

"
1779,"""over"" indicates the dialogue acts are more extreme than the other classes. 
the ""question"" act indicates there is a lack of information provided in the previous sentence. 
  ""directive"" and ""commissive"", on their own, indicate that something is being asked for or given. In this case, it's the direction of the family information.

"
1780,"Out ofinform: the writer is not expressing any opinion, they are simply providing information. 
Overinform : the ratio is higher than average. 
  The writer may be expressing their opinion on this, but it's not a requirement to disclose that opinion.

"
1781,"'over' inform is a sub-classifier for question and answer. 
'think again' question is also a subtype of question
'stop' directive is another subtype for questions
'repeat' commissives are used in conversations to make commitments

In summary, based on this passage, inform and question are the most likely candidates for this dialogue.

"
1782,"Inform is a polite dialogueact that is used when someone is giving information or sharing information. Based on this definition, ""yes"" is an example of information given by the user. ""There are other teasts besides green,black andscented tea"" could be considered as information that was shared between the two parties. 
  
Question is another polite dialog act that can occur when a person wants to know something or is requesting information from another person. In this case, a ""what"" question is being asked.  ""can you please bring me the original and a duplicate copy of the film?"" is the question being posed to the customer. 
Directive is also another dialogue action that occurs when one person gives orders to another. Here,  the customer is telling the developer to bring the required items to them and they will take care of it. Directive can also be used in a negative way, when the other person has to take some action and the first person does not want to follow the order. For example, in this sentence, 'the developer says he will bring it to you, but he doesnot show up' is considered directive usage. Commissive dialogue acts are used to express agreement or confirmation. 'Surely, ofcourse we can do that.' is Commissives used here.

"
1783,"In this case, 'any other' could be understood as a generalisation, meaning that there may be other languages that are unknown to the listener. In this context, a 'foreign language' is one that is not English. Therefore, this could also be considered a query. 
  
If we assume that 'other' refers to other unknown languages, then the question is about whether the person knows any languages other than English, and if so, whether they can speak any of these languages.

"
1784,"In this sentence, ""you"" is the subject of the sentence. This is an indication that ""yes"" in ""You can learn japanease in about a week"" might refer to the same person. In this case, it is possible that the speaker is asking the recipient of that message to learn Japanese in less than a month. 
  
""You"" could also be the object of ""know"" here, in which case the question would be classified more as a query than as an informational statement.

"
1785,"In the first sentence, ""everything's fine"" is the main statement providing general information. After that, in a second sentence the question ""passed"" a band exam in Japanese language is asked. The question is not about general well being, it's about a specific event. 
After the event, there is another question asking how the listener is doing.

"
1786,"Inform (Overinform, Question, Directive, Commissive) is used to provide an up-to-date or current information. The speaker shares information that is relevant to the current context. 
  
Over-inform is when the information provided is too much or too detailed. For example, if the person providing the details is excited or enthusiastic, then the inform part may be over-emphasized. 
Question is an inquiry or request for information or clarification. This is because it contains a verb that indicates that something is being asked for. In this case, it's the question of whether or not the listener has achieved the desired level of proficiency in the language. If the verb is omitted, this is considered a default question. However, when a verbal form is included, a query is inferred.  For example: ""Do you know anyone who has passed lPT?"" is interpreted as a yes/no question; whereas, ""Have you ever passed a lPt?"" would be interpreted to be a statement. A question may also be inferred when it includes a modal verb (e.g., ""Can you pass a test?""). 
 Directives are instructions or requests. They are usually expressed as ""you should do such and such"" or ""do it this way"". 
 Commissives express commitments or promises. These are expressed using the word ""will"" (or ""shall""). For instance, you can express that you will go to a party by saying ""I will going to party"".

"
1787,"Question: doctor, i've been having a headache for a few days now. I don't know if it's a common thing or not, so i was just wondering if you could check it out for me? 
Inform: good morning doctor! i hope you have an excellent day! 


"
1788,"""i'm inpretty badshape,doctorford."" is a statement, not a request for a response. The doctor's response would be ""that's not good, what happened?""

A:
According to the dialogue acts defined by IBM, this is an informative dialogue action.

"
1789,"Question is a request for clarification or information. The provided text does neither ask for a clarification nor does it provide any information about the topic. 
In contrast, inform is the dialogueact for this type of text.

"
1790,"‘always unager’ could be interpreted as an adjective describing the age of a wine, but it could also be a noun describing a person who is not interested or has no appetite for food. In this context, it’s hard to tell which meaning is intended. 
  
In the context of asking someone for their opinion, ‘always’ is a modifier that restricts the scope of what the person is allowed to say. So, in the example sentence, “alwaysunager” could mean “I am an uninterested person”, or “You should have an appetite”, but the latter interpretation is unlikely.

"
1791,"This text does ask for information, but it does so in a way that is typical of the question dialogue type. ""Lose any"" is an open-ended question that does invite a response. However, it also implies that there is some minimum amount of weight that would be considered ""any"". This implies a range, and therefore a statement of fact rather than a request for an explanation. 
  
In contrast, if the dialogue acted were to be more directive or commissivo, then the answer would have been ""no"" or ""not any"". 
   
Finally, inform and question are similar in that they both provide the information to another person, however inform is more about sharing facts and questions are more likely to ask about the details of something.

"
1792,"Inform is a core element of conversation, and is used to share information or answer questions. In this example, ""yes"" is the information provided, followed by a confirmation from the listener.

"
1793,"""the last"" is a temporal expression, and the context of your conversation suggests that you are asking about a recent event. The use of ""the"" indicates a singular event, so the question is not about multiple events. 
Track up is something that people do not typically do without prompting, therefore the prediction is that this is another form of questioning, where the asker is trying to get the addressee to do something. 
  

When was  the  last time  you have  track up?
  The last  time  I  had   track  up  was  when  my  wife  left  me  and  went  to  her  parent's house.

"
1794,"This text is considered to have an informative dialogueact because of the information provided regarding the two-month wait for the pictures. This is likely to reassure the listener that their request will likely be fulfilled. 
  
However, it is also considered an informational dialogueAct because there is no indication that this is a direct request or that it makes a guarantee or promise.

"
1795,"the text asks a follow-up question after providing instructions: ""well, Mr. Brown, I’m happy that it’s nothing major. You just look a bit under the weather.""

directives are used to give instructions to another person, and commissives to make a commitment to someone (e.g., ""I promise to call you tomorrow at noon"").
questions are seeking more details or information from another, typically in the form of an inquiry (as in ""How bad you did?"").

"
1796,"Question is a subcategory of directive. 
Directive is another sub category of question. 
  Based off the given example, you can interpret the message as either a request for a second try or a suggestion to attempt the task again, both of which fall under question category and are therefore predicted as such.

"
1797,"Directives are used to give orders or instructions to another person. In this case, KARA is being told to ""try to do X"", where X could be ""get out more"" or ""go out less"", or do ""Y"" (which could mean ""pack"" and ""move back"").

Inform is used for statements that provide information. 
  
  In this context, ""i don’t think it’s a great idea"" is information, not a request for opinion or advice.

"
1798,"the text contains a request for confirmation,
which is a commissIVE dialogue action. 
However, it is over-commissive, as it contains information that is already provided in the previous sentence. 
  

text:  'yes, i will do it.' 

 

A:
According to the BNC, ""directive"" is the most common predicted label for this dialogue type.  ""Commissive"", ""question"", and ""inform"" are also common.

"
1799,"In this example, ""to see my passport"" is an instruction to a person who is holding a document. This is because the person asking for the document is in a position of authority and is giving an order. In contrast, if the same person were to ask ""can i have your ID?"" then the act would be inform because there would not be a power differential between the two individuals. 
  

A:
According to the dictionary, a dialogue is: ""a conversation between two or more characters""
So, in this case, your text contains two characters: the first is the Person who wants to do something, and the second is his/her Personality. 
If we consider the following example: romeo and Juliet, then Romeo is Persona, who want to be loved, while Juliet is persona of the one who loves. So, Romeos text can be considered as a love letter, written to Juliet. And the way to classify this letter is as Directive.

"
1800,"This text describes a specific type or type(s) of food, sour-peppercorn-soup. The author is suggesting that you try this particular soup to see if it meets your taste. 
  
  This is a request for information, not a statement of fact.

"
1801,"Question is the most likely dialogueact, because the message is seeking information or clarification from its recipient. The recipient is not being asked to do anything, but is being given information to consider. 
  
Out of question: the recipient of such a message would be being questioned, not asked a direct question. 
Directive: this is likely the intended action, however, it does ask for a decision from recipient, and does so in a way that does imply a request for action.

"
1802,"A question would be expected here, as the dialogue acts inform and question are the most likely candidates. However, this is a confirmation, not a request. 
Directives are expected in this context, since the company invited the greek company for talks, and the latter has to do something with the information. 
 Commands are not expected, because this information is not relevant for the listener.

"
1803,"the text does ask for details, by asking how long the person will be visiting. 
it does make an instruction, when the visitor is asked to leave.

"
1804,"Inform is the default dialogueact for texts that seek information from a listener. This is because inform is used in contexts where a person does not need to ask for information (e.g., a salesperson might inform a customer about a special offer). Inform can also be used to seek clarification (a person might ask ""are you sure?"" when they think the other person may not fully understand what was said). 
  
Question is often used when a speaker wants to make a request of another person (for example, a child might question an adult if they need something). This can be contrasted with directive which is typically used by someone who is giving orders or instructions to another (an employee might be told to ""go to the store"" by their manager). Question is also used as a transition between inform and directive. 
   
Directive is commonly used for giving commands or orders (such as ""turn left at red lights""). This differs from commissives, another type of directive used mostly for expressing emotions or feelings (sad, happy, angry, etc.).

"
1805,"Question: ""howmany pieces baggage"" is asking for information, and is therefore classified under question dialogue acts. 
Overinform: the given question is too general and does  not provide enough information to answer the question ""categorically"". 

 

Directive: based on context, ""have you any baggage?"" could be a request for you to check if the person has any luggage, therefore classifying it under directive. However, since the answer is ""no"", it does pose as directive act

"
1806,"Inform is a dialogue-level classification that can be used when the response is not a request for information, a direct order, nor a guarantee. Inform responses are typically reactions to information provided in the conversation. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive are the possible dialogue acts for the following text:
'wOW! That’s fast!! I don’t think We will travel that speed on THE ROAD.'

"
1807,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask someone a direct question. In this case, ""will you be taking it with you when you depart?"". The question mark indicates that the answer to this question is ""yes"" or ""no"", and the inform act indicates the information that is being provided. 
  
In this example, since the question was not asked directly to the person being spoken to, but to someone else, a third party, then the act should be question rather than inform or direct.

"
1808,"In this case, yes, indicates agreement or confirmation. The speaker confirms that yes is the answer to the question they just asked. 
  
This is because yes can also be a response to questions, meaning that it can confirm or agree with what has just been said. In this context, it indicates confirmation that a bill will be provided.

"
1809,"According to this example, it is not possible to drive while the device is in use. However, this is only a general statement and does not ask any question. Therefore, according to these regulations the personal camera can still be used while travelling, provided that it's removed when leaving the airport.

"
1810,"Mike is expressing his preference to not be contacted by Kira. 
He is not providing any information to the contrary.

"
1811,"""have apleasant stay"" is a statement, not a request or command. 
the text does mention a hotel and a date, so it is not just a random statement. 
  

A:
According to the dialogue acts defined by the NLP toolkit, this is an example of an inform statement:  inform (statement).

"
1812,"the text is informative because it provides facts about driving without seeking a clarification, an answer or another opinion
based on this, it is classified inform.

"
1813,"Question: the dialogue acts of question and question response are the most common. These two dialogue Acts are used to ask someone a direct question. The question is used as a starting point for a conversation, and the question responder is responsible for initiating the conversation. 
In this example, 'what should a cv include?' is a valid question that can be asked by a person looking to find out what is required to be considered for employment. 
  

Information: this is the least common of all the possible dialogue actions. Information is typically used when someone is giving information to another person. In this case, it is likely that the person asking the cv question has not worked in a factory before and is looking for guidance on what to include. Therefore, this dialogue action is appropriate.  

"
1814,"Personal information: the personal name and age of both the writer and the reader are shared. 
Educational experience: this is the experience the person has had in school or in their current job. 
  Practical experience : this can be in the form of a job title, company, location, etc.  
  Personal skills: here the individual lists their skills and abilities that they have acquired through training or experience.   
Self-evaluation:  this is an individual's assessment of their own skills or abilities. For example, they may list their strengths and weaknesses.    
Job intentions: in this part, you can see that this person is looking to move to a new city and is open to finding a position there.

"
1815,"the text asks a direct question: ""maybe""
it provides no personal details, such as name or location:  ""i canwatch tv"" 
there is no command or promise:   ""thanks.""

based on these characteristics, this is likely a  question dialogueact.

"
1816,"In this example, I believe the inform dialogue acts are over-predicted. The first inform act, inform is used in the following context:

""You failed the test""
However, in this context, ""you failed"" is a statement of fact, not a request for information. Therefore, this is an example of the over prediction of dialogue Acts of Information.

"
1817,"In this example, ""may I come into the room?"" is an example of a request for permission. The request is made to a person who is in a position of authority (the teacher) and is usually accompanied by a reason why the person requesting the permission should be allowed to enter the space (e.g., ""May I enter this room so that I can show you my project?""). In this context, may is a modal verb, and it indicates permission or permission to consider. In the example above, it is the teacher granting permission for the student to come to the classroom.

"
1818,"Mr. Peter is the name of the sender, so it’s most natural to assume that he is being asked a direct question by the receiver. However, there is no indication that this is actually the case. The question is not followed by a request for a response. Instead, Mr.Peter asks a follow-up question: “what can I do?” This suggests that Mr Peter may be seeking clarification or advice from the listener. 
  
  The question mark at the end of “question” indicates a potential ambiguity in the dialogue. MrPeter could be asking the question in a more general sense, as a way of introducing a topic, rather than specifically asking it of MrPete. In this case, “how to stick” could also be interpreted as “ways to do something”, which would make it aninform dialogueact.

"
1819,"overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are similar, so it's hard to determine which one to use. 
question: it seems like the person is asking the interviewer a direct question
directive: since the conversation is about an appointment, and the appointment is for the job, then it would make sense for them to ask for a recommendation
commissive : since it’s a request for recommendation, this is the most likely dialogue action

I would say that inform is more appropriate than question because the question would be more suitable for someone who is not familiar with the situation, while inform would apply to someone with an understanding of what is going on.

"
1820,"Directive is an act that conveys a message to another person without any further context. In this case, a woman is telling a man to sit, and this is considered directive. 
  
Overinform is when a dialogue acts informally, but the context does not allow for it to take on a more directive role.  In this example, inform is overinform in this context, because it is not possible to tell that the woman was asking a specific person to join her. She could have been asking someone else to help her with something, for example. Without this additional context it would be difficult to determine the correct dialogue action. 
Question is the next most likely dialogue-act category, since the question mark is often used to indicate a query. However, in the example above, there is no indication that a direct query is being made. The question is more likely a comment on how the man is dressed, or a general comment about how people are dressed these days. It is possible that this question was intended to prompt a reply, however, it does appear that there was no request for a follow-up comment. So, while the dialogue is in question form, this does indicate that no directive message was being conveyed.

"
1821,"Inform is a non-verbal communication style that conveys information or advice to a recipient without asking a direct question or giving a request. 
  
  - It is based on an exchange of information between two parties. 
- The speaker provides the information in a calm and deliberate manner.

"
1822,"In the beginning of your answer, you mentioned that you are a software engineer. This is likely why your predicted dialog act was question. However, in a later part of that answer you mention that your degree is in computer science. Based on this, your prediction was incorrect and should have been question instead of question question and answer.

"
1823,"In this example, inform is the most probable dialogueact, as the preference of the speakers for tea-drinking is not a secret. The preference is shared in the first sentence of text. 
However, if the dialogue acts were classified according to the criteria provided in this post, then the classification would be as follows:

Directive: inform
Question: question
Commissive (or Negative Commissive): question

"
1824,"Question is a conversation act that is used to ask for information or clarification. The question mark at the end of a sentence is the typical indicator of question. In this example sentence, ""have any"" indicates a statement that can be interpreted as a yes or no question and is therefore classified under question dialogue acts. 
  
Overinform is another term for yes-no question which means asking the same question multiple times. ""Have you ever done work here?"" is an example of overinform.

"
1825,"Yes, this is a good explanation. Please continue.

"
1826,"Question: ""Question"" is the dialogueact of a statement that seeks information from the listener. The statement ""How much does it cost?"" seeks an explanation or an indication of cost from another person. 
  In this case, ""it"" refers to the price. ""It"" could also refer to something else, such as ""the room"". In this context, asking ""What is this thing called 'it'?"" is a way to seek clarification or information.

"
1827,"In this section, we will discuss the inform and question dialogue acts. The inform dialogue  act is used to provide information to the questioner. This is a two-way conversation where the person asking the questions also needs to be able to give information in order to move the conversation forward. In this example, ""things"" are not a topic of conversation, so the asker is asking for information. 
  
  The question act can either be question or inform depending on whether the information is being provided by the addressee or being requested by someone else. If the request is coming from someone other than the one asking, then the dialogue is considered to have a query structure. For example: ""are you sure you want to do that?"" is an example of a request for additional information coming form another person. ""I want you to go to a certain website and then click on a link that says'register'"". In that case, it would be classified under the query dialogue structure, because ""register"" is the topic being discussed.

"
1828,"Inform is used when the information provided by the sender is needed by receiver. In this case, since the recipient is the one asking for help (i.e. the ""you""), it is likely that this person is familiar or has knowledge of the procedure.

"
1829,"In this example, ""very much"" qualifies as information. The speaker is conveying their opinion about a topic, and by adding ""yes"" they are expressing their agreement with the opinion.

"
1830,"Inform is a dialogue-act type that is used to share information. Based on this message, it can also be inferred that the speaker is seeking information from the addressee. 
  
Question is another dialogue action type. It can indicate that there is uncertainty about a statement or a request. In this case, there might not be an agreement between the two parties.

"
1831,"This text asks a person whether they would like a cup of tea. The question is not seeking any information, it's asking for a yes or no response. It is therefore classified here as a query rather than a statement. 
Where to is a request for direction. A question would be seeking direction, a directive would make an offer of direction and a commissives would accept direction from another person. In this case, where to would appear in a conversation between a host and an invited guest. 
  The host would ask the guest where they'd like to go for their tea, and the invited person would respond with where the host should take them.

"
1832,"In the given context, it can reasonably be assumed that 'three hours' is a time limit for covering the specified distance. The speaker therefore seeks to confirm the timeframe of the response from their interlocutor. 
  
It can also be reasonably assumed from this context that there are multiple types/sources of  energy being considered. As such, this is likely a request for clarification regarding which types are being mentioned.

"
1833,"Question: ""the dialogueact ofthis text was classifiedas question""

This is because based on my analysis, this is a ""question"" dialogue
  act because it contains a clause that is an interrogative sentence
(i.e. ""why"") and it is asking a follow up question. The question is ""Why
was the dialogueAct of the above text classified  asquestion?""
In order to answer this question we need to know the classification ofthe above dialogue Act. Based on this answer, it can also be classified
as aquestion dialogue ACT.

"
1834,"This text is suggesting that someone can help them find something. The question mark indicates that this is being asked, so the answer can provide further information.

"
1835,"Inform is the most general dialogue action category. It can be used to express any type or information that can fit into the ""yes, tell me"" category, including statements, questions, commands, and promises. 
  
Out of the four categories, inform is one of two categories that is not mutually exclusive. That is, a speaker can use inform to convey information as well as questions or commands. Inform can also be combined with other categories. For example, if a person is telling you that a friend is coming to town, they could also use question to ask ""is she coming with her car?"" or command to order you to ""call her and tell her to bring her vehicle."" 
   
Overinform is another category that combines inform with another dialogue category (question or directive). 
    
Question is used when a listener is expected to make an inquiry or request of another person. A question can include a verb, such as asking, telling, asking to, etc. An example of question is ""do you think it will rain?"".  A question also includes a subject, typically a noun or pronoun, that acts as the object of ""think"". 
     
Directive is when one person gives orders to another. Directives can take the form of commands or requests. Commands are orders that are given to someone to carry out a task, often with a time limit. Requests are requests that ask someone for something, usually in return for a favor.

"
1836,"the text does ask for clarification, by stating ""what"" and ""the 11 th avenue""
based on this information, it can be inferred that ""park street"" is the location of the flowers, but the actual location is not specified

A:
According to the NLTK's classify_discourse_categories function, this is an inform question: 
Inform questions are usually used to gather information from a person. They are not asking questions but providing the information that was asked.

"
1837,"Inform is the most common dialogue acts in this example. The predicted text is simply sharing information that is available to the reader. Therefore, inform is an appropriate classification. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive: the dialogueact is out of order. Inform (and question) are the first two choices, and commissives are third choices. However, in order to classify a dialogue as question or command or promise, all three choices must be present. Here, only two of three are present, so the classification is invalid.

"
1838,"the text does ask for an order, by using the word 'order' in the last line. 
question is the only other category that includes commissives, and commissiveness is present in this example. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, you are right that question is another category of dialogue acts. The following is an example of question dialogue: 

 

Doctor: Hello, how can I help you? 

 
Customer: I have been having a headache for the past few days. Can you please check it? 


 

"
1839,"Inform is a directive dialogue action that indicates someone is providing information or giving information. The inform action is used when the sender is not seeking information from or of benefit to the receiver. Inform can also be used to request or suggest information, or to make a request known to be reasonable. 
  
Question is another directive action, indicating someone wants to know something. Question can be followed directly by inform or commissively. Commissively, someone asks a direct question but also wants the answer to inform someone else.

"
1840,"Question is used to direct conversation between two people. It is typically used in a conversation where one person is asking another a question. The question can also be used as a way to request information from another person. In this case, it would be a polite request. 
In this example, ""What would  you like  for your  main course?"" is the question ""How would You like your meal?"".

"
1841,"Inform is used when the information being sought is not critical to understanding the question or answer. For example, when someone asks ""Where is the bathroom?"", inform is appropriate because they do not need to know the location of an important room in the house. 
  
Question is when a person is being asked a direct question and is expected to provide an appropriate answer, but is also seeking confirmation or additional information. In this example: ""Do you like steak?"". A question is indicated by the word ""why"" or ""what"" in front of ""do you"". 
   
Directive is for when an individual is asked to perform an action, and the individual has the choice to accept or decline the request.  In this case, ""Have a Steak"" is directive.

"
1842,"Question: This text contains a request for information, as the second sentence requests that you read something. This is a typical request in a dialogue, and the question mark indicates uncertainty about the request. 
  
Overinform: the first sentence provides a lot of information that is unnecessary for the reader to understand the main point of the paragraph. 
Quotation: this is an example of a quotation in which the author is paraphrasing what another person said. In this case, ""it's really hot a potato"" is what the person who said it said, so the dialogue acts are question and directive.

"
1843,"Inform is defined as sharing only information, and does NOT include asking questions, making promises, nor giving commands. 
Overinform is when a dialogue acts inform label is over-represented in a conversation. 
  For example, if a large number of people label a text asinform, this may be considered overinformanty.

"
1844,"Directive is the most general type of dialogue acts. In this context, it is used to express a person's wishes, instructions, orders, etc. 
Overinform is a negative prediction of directive. Here, a directive act would be perceived as too specific, too detailed, whereas the actual directive would actually be more general or less specific. For example, if a customer asks for one of your product, you would predict a commissIVE act instead of a direct order. 
  
Question is another general prediction for directive acts, but it can also be used for inform acts (when the question is about facts, not orders). 

 

A:

I would say that question and directive are the two most likely outcomes.  The text does ask for maps and it does give an instruction.

"
1845,"the text does ask questions, such as 'can chines people live' and 'do chineese people like drinking teas'
it gives commands, like 'drink tea' or'stop drinking' 
and it makes commitments, for example, 'I promise to stop drinking Chinese tea'.

"
1846,"Question is the most likely dialogueact for this passage. The passage is requesting information from a listener, and the listener is likely to be the addressee. Furthermore, it contains a request for feedback, indicating that this is a situation where the information provided is not enough to make a decision. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue: A Theory of Meaning"" by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, ""question"" is an example of ""metaphorical speech act"".  In other words, a ""speech act"" that is used to convey information about something that can be described in terms of something else.  For example, asking a person if they are busy is like asking if someone is busy at work.

"
1847,"In this example, ""yes"" is a reply to a previous statement, so the answer is overinformative. 
""sure, ofcourse"" could be seen as a clarification of the statement ""chinese love tea"", so it should be classified under question. However, it could also be considered as an agreement, and thus the classification should remain the same.

"
1848,"Question: the first part of question is overinform, as the question does not provide any useful information to the recipient. The second part is the core part, where the information is sought. In this case, it is about the recent news. 
Directive: based on this part and the context, this is likely a request to know about recent government news, and is therefore a direct request. 
  
Commissive (or commissivo): the last part in the sequence is commissives, indicating that this was a command or order. However, there is no indication in this context that it was an order, so it likely is instead a comment on recent events.

"
1849,"Question dialogue Acts are characterized by seeking knowledge from another person. The question in the above text indicates the author is trying to understand if recipient has seen the item. 
Inform dialogue Act is characterized as giving confirmation to another.  The text'here it  is' indicates to recipient that something has arrived.

"
1850,"Inform is used when one is seeking information, typically from another person, but does so indirectly. For example, one might ask another ""how are you?"" but the answer is sought indirectly through a conversation partner. 
Question is the opposite ofinform. When one asks another a direct question the result is typically a commit, request, order, suggestion, etc. 
  
Overinform is when a dialogue acts inform but is not appropriate. An example of overinform would be if you were walking down the street and a car speeds up next to you and you say ""are you ok?"". That would count as over inform because you are not seeking any information but are instead expressing concern for the driver's well being.

"
1851,"In the first line, ""i"" is used as subject and ""can't"" as a verb. These are typical subject-verb agreement patterns in English. However, in this case, we can see that ""cannot"" modifies ""deal"" rather then ""Can"", which would indicate that the subject of the sentence is the verb ""to deal"". This indicates the possibility of a conditional statement being expressed. 
  
""I"" in ""I try"" can be interpreted as an impersonal pronoun, rather that a subject. In this interpretation, there is a possibility that it is being used in a passive voice, where the action of ""trying"" would be performed by the listener. 
However, this is not the case in our example, as the ""try"" verb is in present tense, indicating that both the actor and the recipient of action are still involved in performing the act.

"
1852,"""this"" is used as an adverb to indicate the current time, so the dialogue acts out of order are question and inform. 
the use ""orientation"" indicates the context is not important, and so we can classify the act as question or inform based on whether the information sought is important or not. In this case, it appears that ""they"" are not relevant to the conversation, therefore the inform act applies.

"
1853,"This text contains information seeking, but does so in a way that is not asking for confirmation, clarification, information, etc. Rather, it is providing information without asking. This is an example of the inform dialogue acts. 
It also contains a request for information. However, this request is for future information and does  not contain any information that can only be obtained in-the-future. Therefore, we classify this as a future-oriented request. 
  
  The predicted act will be inform.  This is because this is a text that provides  information about current sources of energy and future energy plans.

"
1854,"In this company's introduction there is a mention of various topics that are important to the company. The mention is not a question or request, but rather a summary of important information. Therefore, this is an example of informational dialogue acting.

"
1855,"Question: 1. Do you have a bunch of drugs at home? 
2. Where do  you get these from? 
  Directive: 3. Buy some from me. 
    commissives: 4. Don ’t lie to me, man. I’ll tell the cops.

"
1856,"""yes"" is a statement, not a request for confirmation. The listener is expected to confirm the statement. 
it is ""not easy"" to share personal information, and the person asking the question may not be able to identify their own weaknesses. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think the answer is that the inform is the most appropriate.  The question is more of a direct request, while the directive and commissives are more for giving orders.

"
1857,"""isn't that enough?"" is a statement, not a request for confirmation. 
It is not clear from the context whether the question is directed at the listener or the food. 
  
If it is the latter, then it would be a comment, and not an ask question
  as the comment would not be directed to the addressee.

"
1858,"Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is a special case where the information provided is about an individual and not a group. The statement that tea (which is an item not an animal) is second in popularity to water is also not asking or providing a query. As a result, this is classified under the directive dialogue type. 
  
Question: In the passage, there is no mention of a graduation date. Is this person expecting a date? If so, when is this expected date and what is their major? 
    
Directive: Based on this passage and the provided information, I can see that this individual is expecting their graduation in 2023 and they have a major in Accounting.


 commissIVE: This text does contain a request or command. In this case, it would be appropriate to classify this as a commissitive dialogue. Commissives are used to make promises or requests of their recipients. For example, if a person is asked to do something for you, that is considered a commissitive request. If the request is for a long time, such as 'be my wife for the next decade', that would also be considered as commisitive. However, a simple request such a 'can you show the door' would not be acommisive. A commision is when one person makes a decision or request of another person, typically for payment or some form of benefit. Since the command in this example is to show someone the path to a department, we can classify it as commissative. 


In summary, based on our analysis of these four dialogue types, our prediction for this dialogue is: directive. Please explain your reasoning. 
based on your analysis, your prediction is correct. the actual dialogue in question is commissives. however, since the other three types do not apply, none of them can apply here. therefore, you are correct that there was no way for us to predict the correct dialogue here

"
1859,"This text uses the word ""have"" to introduce the topic of appointment, suggesting that it is a request for confirmation. 
Mike's response ""yep, I made the appointment"" confirms that Mike has made a prior appointment with Ernest, and therefore confirms the request.

"
1860,"""of course"" is an example of a statement of fact, so the inform act was the most likely outcome. 
the question mark at the end of ""ofcourse"" indicates that this is a conditional statement, meaning that ""if"" something happens, then ""yes""

A:
According to the Dialogue Act Dictionary, ""monica"" in the following text is the subject of whom the dialogue acts are being applied to: ""I know that Monica is here. I'll go talk to her.""
In this case, it's the third person singular present tense of monic, a person's first name.

"
1861,"Directive is the most general type of dialogues act, where the message is about future actions. In this case, it's about taking a right (as the elevator on left is currently in maintenace) to go to floor 3107. The directive dialogue is usually used when the action is complex and requires more than one step, like booking a hotel room. 
  
Overinform is used to describe a situation when a person is giving information that is not useful or required. For example, a salesman may give the customer a lot of information without any real value. Overinform can also describe an action that requires information, but the person giving the information does provide unnecessary details, wasting the time of the receiver. 
Question is another type a dialogue that can occur when giving or receiving information. A question usually requires a yes/no answer, while directive requires the answer to be more complex.

"
1862,"Inform (or overinform) is used when the sender is providing or sharing information to the receiver. The receiver is then free to choose how to act upon this information. 
  
Question (question, out ofinform, direct, commisive)  is used to seek information or advice from another person, and the person being questioned is expected to provide the information, make the decision, etc.  This is the most common type of dialogue acts used in conversations.

"
1863,"Inform is used when the information being offered is not confirmation of an action already taken, but is instead offered as information for informational purposes. For example, a salesperson might offer to sell a product to a customer without the customer having previously expressed an interest in purchasing the product. In this case, inform is the correct dialogueact for this situation. 
  
Question is another way of asking for information or clarification. When a person is asking another person a direct question they are seeking information from that person. If the person being asked does not provide the answer they will be asked another question. A person may also be asking questions to clarify something that has already been discussed. An example of when a dialogue acts as a query is when two people are having a conversation and one person mentions a book they read that was very interesting. The other person then asks what was so interesting about the book. They are now being questioned to provide information about what they just mentioned. Question is also used in requests for action. 
For example:  'Would you like to have a cup of coffee?' or 'Would it be possible for you to do that?'. 
 
Directive is an instruction to another to carry out an act or perform an operation. Directives are used to give orders or instructions to someone else.   

Commissive are offers of help or assistance. Commissives can be used as questions. ‘Would this help?’ or ‘Do you think this would help?’. 
 
  

"
1864,"Question: This text indicates the asker is sharing
information about when the receiver can expect the
receiver's product. It is a request for a time frame,
making it more of question than of provide information. 
  

Overinform: Although the information provided is useful, it
is not necessary for the question to have been asked. For
example, if the request was for money, then the inform
dialogue act may be appropriate. However, in this case, 
 the provide
Information dialogue acts are more appropriate, as the 
 ask
er simply wants to share information: ""when will you have it?""
question
.

"
1865,"Directives are statements that tell someone what to do. In this case, it is telling Mike that we should pack our bags and prepare to return home, because the sender (the person who sent the message) is young and is not married. 
  
In contrast, directives are requests for information or assistance. The directive in this example is the statement ""Please let me know if you need anything."" This is an example of a request for assistance, not a statement of what thesender wants to happen.

"
1866,"the text is asking the receiver for advice on how to treat the symptoms the speakers are currently experiencing. 
this is an example of a commissIVE dialogue, where the message is requesting or expecting a reply.

"
1867,"Inform is the most common dialogue acts, with statements that provide information to another person. The statement in this example, ""i will Graduate from Peking University this July"" is an example of informational dialogue. 
  
Question is another common dialogical act, where one person asks a question to which another responds. In this case, there is no question in text – instead, it’s a request for confirmation. ""Do you still remember me?"" is such a example. However, in some cases, questions can also be informational, such as ""What is 2 + 2?"".

"
1868,"This text does ask about cheaper tea, so it could be classified under question. However, it does so in a way that does seek information, in the form of the question 'need i need cheaper teas'.

A:
According to the model, this is a Question. The model is not able to predict the exact dialogue acts in this case.

"
1869,"This text expresses the positive opinions of the author about a current event. This is an example of information giving. 
Over giving information can lead to confusion.

"
1870,"Inform: the message is not seeking any information, so the dialogue acts inform and question are not applicable. 
Question: there is a request in the previous sentence for the answer to a yes/no question about whether the receiver has seen the car. Therefore, this is classified a  question. 
  Directive: this sentence is an instruction, and the word 'have' indicates a command. Directives are always commissives with the exception of commands which are commissivo. The sentence implies a need for action, therefore it should be classified with a commissIVE dialogue.  

A:
According to your explanation, you are right. It is the question of ""have you seen..."". And the correct answer is ""yes"".

"
1871,"the text asks a direct question about what the caller can do, indicating that it's a seeking of information
but the dialogue acts classification does NOT include an answer in the form of a directive or commissIVE act, so it cannot be answered as of course the answer is ""what can you do?""

"
1872,"This text can also be seen as an order or an imperative, indicating that it is a command or request for the receiver to do something. 
However, it also has the characteristic of a request, asking for confirmation or desire from another person. In this case, this is the person's spouse. Based on this, I would classify this as the directive dialogueact.

"
1873,"Out ofinform, this is the first sentence of your text. This indicates the author is introducing the main topic of their text and is therefore classified here as overinform. 
Question, there is no question in this sentence. However, in the next sentence, a quotation mark is used to indicate that a rhetorical question is being posed. 
  
  Outofquestion, no directive or commissives are present in these sentences. They are simply statements of fact.

"
1874,"'i seen a poy of earrings outside of your winow.' implies the action of showing the earring to the person asking. 
'that implies you can show me the poyo of earsrings.' asks a direct question of the addressee, and is therefore a query. 
  'can you show me that poya ofearsrings?' is a request for permission, therefore being commissitive.

"
1875,"Question dialogue acts are used to elicit information from another person. In this case, it seems that a direct question would be 'why are you telling me all of these things about your health? Why are asking me about my symptoms?'. However, this question is actually a disguised request for advice, in which the questioner is essentially asking the other person to 'fix' their health problem. 
  

In contrast, inform and directive dialogue Acts are not asking questions, but instead are providing the information to the receiver. Therefore, a better question might be, 'what can I do to help alleviate my health problems?', or 'how can you help me with this?' 
   
Commissive dialogue is used when someone is asking someone else to do something, typically in a negative context. For example, if I ask you to stop smoking, I am asking you do a favour for me.

"
1876,"'how much' is a relative clause that modifies the main clause 'for them'. relative clauses are typically used to provide additional information or clarification about what was said before the relative pronoun. in this case, it is providing additional context about 'want'. the question mark indicates a potential question that may be asked.

"
1877,"overinform: the amount is not specified, so it is overinformative. 
question: it does provide a price for the item but does it ask for a clarification?  No, because the question is already answered in the previous sentence. The price is provided. So there is no need for another clarification here. 
 Question: is the order of the dialogue acts correct? The answer is yes. 
directive: ""Let's Go!"" suggests a direction or action to follow. In this case, ""Go!"". But the actual action is missing. Therefore, this is classified under directive.

"
1878,"Question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the asker is looking for more information. 
Overinform: this is an over-informing dialogueact, where the information provided is too much. Inform is the default dialogue action, and is used for providing general information or answers to questions. 
  Question is overinform.

"
1879,"Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are similar, so the model is unsure which one to predict. 
Question: this is the first time the user will see this dialogue action, therefore it is likely the system is confused and predicting inform instead of question
Directive: based on this sentence, 'yes,you'reright', the dialogue action is about providing a reply, not about asking or clarifying something.

"
1880,"This is a request for a service, not a discussion of personal preferences. 
It is an order, rather than a suggestion. 
  
  The speaker wants the other person to do something, such as wrap the flowers or give him the bill.

"
1881,"Inform is a good choice because it describes the response of the sender of information. The sender is expressing that they cannot provide the information requested due the nature of it being information, not a request for a specific action. 
  
Question is another good option because this is the first time the receiver is being asked to make a decision. In this case, it would be a choice between two options, leading or following. Leading would mean going faster, while following would imply going slower.

"
1882,"In this example, 'how did I do' is a non-question asking the listener for feedback.

"
1883,"the text starts with 'goodmorning'. This is an informal greeting that indicates the two parties are already acquainted and establishing a friendly tone for communication. This text does not contain a statement of information, so the predict dialogue acts out of question and directive. 
'this is' is used to introduce the subject of the sentence. Since the greeting is followed by a time period (i'dlike some) and a person (please), it can reasonably be inferred that the 'this' refers to a specific person and not a general concept. 
                                                                *                                                                      (out  of question, question , direct  question, commissitive)

In addition, there is no request in this sentence for a service. Requests for services are classified under commissives. The predict dialog act for commissivess is commissIVE.

                                            (good  morning.  this  is  room 113 .   i  'd  like  some  breakfast,  please.)

 

"
1884,"Question is a sub-type of directive. A question asks a person or an entity to do something. In this case, a listener is asked to believe a statement. 
Directive is another sub type. Directives are commands that are given to a human or to an artificial agent. The command is usually given in response to another command. For example, ""Do as I say"" or ""Go to the store and get me milk"". In the example above, someone is asking someone else to go to store to get milk. 
  In this example the directive is given by the question ""go to  store to buy milk"" to which the command ""buy milk from the grocery store"" is replied to with a ""yes sir"".

"
1885,"Inform is a dialogueact that is used when the dialogue partner is giving information. The partner does so by expressing their feelings, thoughts, opinions, etc. Inform acts are typically used in short, one-time exchanges. 
Overinform is when a conversation is predicted to be overinform, based on how long it takes for information to travel from one person to another. Overinform can be a problem, as it can lead to people feeling like they are not being heard, even when they were. To avoid over-predicting overform, try to remember if the information being shared is new to you or not. If it's new, you might want to wait a bit before you make an offer to share it with others.

"
1886,"the text asks a clarifying question about what can be expected of you
it is a request for clarification, and not a directive or commissivo
there is no command or promise being asked for, therefore it does fall under question

A:
According to your explanation, it seems like the question is about clarifications. So the answer is that it's a clarification question because it asks for clarification.

"
1887,"Question dialogue acts are used to probe for information or to request specific actions from the other person. The question in this example is asking for specific items to go with a meal. 
  
Overinform dialogue Acts are often used when the information provided is too much or too little. In this case, it's too expensive for a single night. This is an overinform because the provided information is more information than is necessary.

"
1888,"This text is requesting something from the listener, so it's classified under commissives. 
Just a couple minutes won't kill you, but I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave now.

"
1889,"Inform indicates the information is provided without a request for confirmation or a guarantee. It is also used to describe a person providing general information without any commitment or request. 
  
Question indicates a direct request or an attempt to confirm information. This is used most often in negotiations or when someone is trying to convince someone else of a point.

"
1890,"Question is the most likely dialogueact, as the question marks in the beginning of each sentence indicate that Sam is requesting information from the listener. The question is also relatively long, containing 14 words. 
In addition, Sam uses the word 'ideas' in a way that indicates a request for suggestions. 
  
Directive is another likely response.  The text contains the words 'arrange' which implies a command or request to perform an action.

"
1891,"Directives are instructions that are given by a person to another person. Rachel tells the pet owner to go visit Rachel's Pet Store. 
  
Out of directives, questions are the most common dialogue acts. A question is asked of another individual, and the other individual is expected to provide information or make a decision. For example, ""why did you call me?"" is considered a direct question from Rachel. The person answering the question will provide an answer that explains why they called Rachel, such as ""I was worried about you and wanted to make sure you were okay."" 
   
Inform is the second most frequent dialogue action, followed by directive and commissIVE. An inform action is given to someone who is not a recipient of the information (such as Rachel telling the owner of her pet that she is going to visit the Rachel Pet store). 
    
A commissitive action can occur if a message is sent to a group of people, but the sender is expecting a response from only one person (for example a text message sent out to all members of an email list). In this case, a commissative action indicates a lack of intent to communicate with more than one individual.

"
1892,"Question acts are used to seek information, make requests, ask questions, request clarification, give directives, etc. The question act in this example is used in conjunction with the following context: ""Can you please hold this for later?"" This indicates the questioner is looking for confirmation or a response. 
  
In contrast, inform acts convey facts or information without asking questions. In this case, there is no question in the context, so inform is the correct dialogue action.

"
1893,"the text does not express a question or command, but rather an offer of apology
there is not a commitment or intent to alter the current state of affairs

A:
According to this article, there are four possible classes for a dialogue acts: 
1. Inform: This is the most common class for dialogue Acts. It is used when the dialogue partner is conveying information to the listener.  2. Request: When the partner wants something from the other. 3. Commendation: To commend someone for something. 4. Directive: Used when someone wants the recipient to take some action.

"
1894,"Snakes are not mentioned in the given passage. However, based on my experience, people are generally afraid of snakes. So, in this case, it is likely that this is a query to find out if there are any actual snakes in that region. 
If there is actually a snake in-region, then the person asking this question will definitely be afraid and will try to avoid contact with the snake.

"
1895,"Snakes are not exotic. They are in fact, common. 
  There are rodents, and even monkeys, that are exotic! 
   Snake, mouse, monkey are common in nature. However, they do not fall into the category of 'exotic'. 
    Therefore, inform is the most appropriate dialogue category for this dialogue.

"
1896,"In this example, we can see that although the given dialogue acts are all possible, inform is the most likely one. First, notice that inform can be used in both the question and the answer positions. In the first position, it indicates a request for additional information, whereas in second position it is a confirmation of what was just said. Second, consider the following text: ""i'll take you there next week"". This text contains the word ""there"" which can also be a directive or a place. If we were to use the dialogue rule to predict the next action of ""take you"", the rule would return ""question"". However, in this case, ""I'll go there"" is an offer to go to a specific place, and therefore the dialogue rule returns ""inform"".

A:
(over)inform (question, direct, order, command)
I will take her there the week after next.

"
1897,"This text could be considered a request for information, since it begins with 'are you...', which is an inquiry. 
Additionally, it could also be classified under the question dialogue acts, because it contains a 'question' followed by a statement. 
  
However, this is likely not the case, given that 'it has kept me on my toes' is not a direct question. It is more of  a statement of fact, and therefore falls under inform.

"
1898,"In this example, we can see that this is not a request for assistance, but rather a query for information from another party. The lack of smoking outlets is mentioned in the first sentence, and the second sentence is an explanation of why there aren't enough smoking areas. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think the answer is because Queen size beds are cool, so the question is ""is it okay?"".

"
1899,"Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the most appropriate. The predicted text is not seeking clarification or confirmation, but rather sharing information. Inform is also the least risky of all the possible acts. 
  

A:
According to the GPT-3 model, there are 4 possible actions: question(outofquestion,question), directive(directive,direct), commissives(commissive), and inform(overinform,overquestion). 
In your case, Gpt-2 model predicts that the input text asks a direct question which means question is one of its possible action.

"
1900,"""praise"" is a noun, so it could be a verb or a adjective. Based on context, we can assume that it means ""thank You very Much"".

However, ""praising"" could also mean ""complaining"" or ""saying something is good but not praising the person who said it"". Based again on this context and the rest of the sentence, this is unlikely.

"
1901,"Overinform: the statement provides too much information, it does ask for clarification, and it makes a commitment or promise. 
Question:  the statement asks a clarifying question and makes an offer or request. 
  Directive: this is a statement that gives orders or instructions.  
Commissive : this type of statement makes promises or offers advice.

"
1902,"inform is the most general dialogueact, and it is used for any kind or message. In this case, inform is being used to describe a request for clarification. 
question is another general term for a message that is looking for an information or answer. The question in this example is ""these rose"" which implies the sender is trying to convey a point or recommendation. 
  question can also be used in a negative way to express a doubt or uncertainty. For example, ""are you sure those roses are for me?"".  
directive is an action that someone takes on another person or group. Here, it implies a suggestion or course-of-action.   
commissive means that a person is telling someone else to do something. in the example above, this is what the ""make your wifes happy"" part is suggesting.

"
1903,"In the given context, keeping those animals in the house is a choice that the owner made. However, this choice is not a wise one, as it is very likely to expose the pets to the risk of getting sick. This is because pets can be carriers of many diseases that can infect humans, and keeping pets in close proximity to humans is generally not considered a healthy practice. 
  
  In addition, pets are very dependent on their owners. Keeping them at home without the owners is likely going to cause a lot of stress for the pet. The owner is probably going be away on business or on vacation, so the animal will be left alone. Being left without proper care can lead to a number of problems, including depression, aggression, self-mutilation, etc.

"
1904,"In this example, ""we could not go that quickly"" is considered overinformative, because it is not specific enough to answer the question of whether the person could go as fast as the car was going. ""We could never go at that speed"" would be more specific, but still not very helpful. 
""if we had gone that quick"" could be interpreted as a request for advice, and would therefore be classified under question dialogue acts.

"
1905,"Inform (also called question) is a conversation act that conveys information. 
  It is used to ask for or receive information from another person. 
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive

"
1906,"""our message"" is not a complete sentence, so it does NOT appear to ask for additional details. Therefore, it can be classified under the inform category. 
the text uses the word ""flashing"" to describe the message light, but does so in the present tense, indicating that the light is currently flashing, not that this was the case in past. In other words, ""our"" message is describing the current state of the lamp, and not something that happened in a past time. 
  This is consistent with ""question"" as a classification for the dialogue acts in this instance.

"
1907,"This text contains a request for information. The request is for the reader to wait a moment, and the request does so by stating that they will wait. It is therefore classified under the commissives category. 
  
However, this is not the only reason why this classification is incorrect. In addition to the fact that this request was made in a tone of urgency, there are also grammatical issues with the sentence. ""Please wait"" is an infinitive, a form of the verb to be, so the entire sentence should be re-written as follows:

Hold on, I'm going to learn you something. Please wait for amoment.

"
1908,"Inform is the most general dialogueact, and can also be used for questions. 
  The text provides information to the asker about the answer to their question: ""you sure know about Chinese Tea?"". 
Question is used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision. For example, ""why did the plane crash?"" is classified here.  
Directive is when one person gives orders to another. This is often used in business transactions. ""Please pass the salt."" is an example of a directive dialogue. Commissive dialogue is where one actor asks another to do something, but does not specify what that something is. Inform, direct and commissives are the main classes of dialogue acts.

"
1909,"Inform: This is the first time we are hearing about this request from the
sender. We do not know the context of their request or why they are
requesting this from Mr. Johns. 
Question: Based on this, we can assume that Mr John's needs to speak to Mr Johns about something. Mr Johnson is not mentioned before this point, so it is unclear what this is about. 
  Also, it seems like Mr Jonson is asking Mr Johnston for a favor. However, this does not seem like a direct request. It is more of an inquiry.  
Directive:  Based off of Mr jonson's request and the fact that he is speaking to someone named John, I believe this to  be a command.   
Commissive : This text does indicate that mrs jane is being spoken to. So,  it is possible that this could be a conversation between two people. But, based on Mr Jonns request to talk to mister johns, and his request being to a person named joseph, i believe it to also be an order.

"
1910,"Directive is the dialogue acts of making requests or orders. In this case, since the request is for the person to bring it to the room, this is classified under directive. 
  
Question is asking for information, clarification, etc. Since the question is 'What for?', it is likely that the asker is looking for an explanation for something.

"
1911,"In this case, there is no information provided in the given dialogue that indicates a directive or commissIVE act. The only information is that there are no available teachers at that time. Therefore, this is classified under inform and not directive. 
However, if the context had provided information that a decision needed to made or an instruction was given, then the act would have been commissively classified.

"
1912,"This is the first text in the conversation where we see the use of 'then'. This indicates a change of scene, where something new is about to happen. Based on this, we can predict that there will be a directive act in this conversation. 
Then is an indicative conjunction used to introduce a new scene or action in a story. In this case, 'Then' is used as the scene changes and we expect a different act to follow.

"
1913,"In the example provided, it seems that both the inform and question dialogue acts are applicable. The question act would be used to seek clarification, while the commissIVE act could be applied if the speaker is expecting a response and is giving instructions or a warning.

"
1914,"In this example, ""it’s free"" is a statement of fact, not a request for further information. The statement is not ambiguous and does indicate a need for an explanation. 
""it” is the subject of the sentence, so the statement can be classified under the “inform” dialogue acts. 
  “it is free” indicates a lack of cost, and is therefore an “out” of “free”. 
   “free” can also be an out of a “question” because it indicates an absence of obligation.

"
1915,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask a person a direct question and require a response. In this example, ""are"" is a yes/no question that requires a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer.

"
1916,"Question: the dialogue acts of 'the economist' are question-based, and this is one of them. The economist is a well-known British newspaper, where you can find articles, op-eds, etc. 
  Overinform: this dialogue action is overinform, because it is more than just providing information. Inform is the first option, but the second one is also question - asking. So, in this case, it's a combination of question and directive. 
As you said, 'it should a drive of two hours on a motor way'. So the answer is provided in the next line.

"
1917,"This text indicates the speakers wants the listeners to cook the dinner, so it is a request. 
Or this is an example of a text that is making an offer, where the offer is to teach the person how to prepare dinner the next night.

"
1918,"Out of question: the assistant editorship is not an offer, it is an appointment. 
Over question - the appointment is for a trial period, and if the candidate is interested they will be hired. 
  
Question - there is no information provided about what the role of assistant is, whether it requires any special qualifications, etc. Therefore, this is considered a query.  

"
1919,"Question is the most likely dialogue acts for this message, as the message is requesting the addressee's agreement or opinion. However, this is a complex message with multiple participants, so it's possible that inform or another dialogue action may have been intended. 
  

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible answers for a ""question"" in a conversation: 
1. Yes/No
2. I don't know
3. No, I will ask the person
4. Maybe

"
1920,"Inform is a directive dialogue action that means to tell someone something. In this case, she is telling the writer that she will be on leave and who can take over the writing of her column. 
  
Question is another directive action, meaning to ask a direct question of someone. The writer is now asking the pregnant columnist if she needs assistance.

"
1921,"Question is a specialised form of directive. Question words appear in questions to request information from another person, and are followed by a subject (who, what, where, when, why, how many, etc.) to receive a response. 
  
Directive is used when someone is giving information to another, but the information is being given in a commanding or commanding-like tone. Directives are often followed with a verb indicating that someone should do something (order, tell, order tell). 
   
 commissIVE is similar to question in that it is asking information of another. However, it also conveys a sense of urgency or importance, as it often appears in instructions or orders.

"
1922,"Inform is used when someone is giving information to another person. It is not used for asking a direct question or making a directive statement. 
Overinform is when the information provided is too much. For example, if someone were to say ""I love you"", it would be overinformative to include a list of reasons why they love the other person, such as ""because you are the best person in the world"", ""you are so smart"", or ""your hair is so beautiful"".
Question is the most common dialogueact in a conversation. When someone asks a person a questions, they are usually seeking confirmation or clarification of something the questioner already knows. 
  For example: ""Are you married?"" ""No, I am not."" ""Oh, are you single?""  ""No.""
Directive is for giving orders. This is usually used in business or in relationships where one person gives orders to a group of people. An example of giving an order is ""Take out the trash."" 

 

A:

I'm available to travel.

"
1923,"Question: ""are"" you ""looking forward"" to ""doing more"" editing ""work?""

In this example, ""Are you Looking forward To Doing More Editing Work?"" the question mark indicates that the speaker is not sure, but is likely going to do more work on this project. The question is followed by a colon (':') which indicates the sentence is a sentence question and should be followed with a response. 
  The response should provide a yes or no answer. If the answer is no, then the dialogue is over.

"
1924,"the text provides information without asking for confirmation
it is offering or suggesting something to the other person

A:
According to this article, there are four types of dialogue acts: 
1. Inform: This is the default dialogue acting style.  The speaker simply provides the information that is relevant to understanding the context of the dialogue.   

2. Question:  This dialogue-act style is used when the speaker is asking the question. 
 
3. Directive: When the  speakers are giving the instructions or requesting the action from the listener.  
4. Commissive :  This is when the speaker makes a commitment or promise.

"
1925,"Question asks a direct question to a recipient. The question is ""Do you (have) any (order) forms (here) so (that) i (can) get (a subscription) to (the) magazine?"". 
  

Overinform,  question, direct, command:
This is a very general dialogue, and the information provided is not very specific. Therefore, it's likely that the person asking for this information does have an order form, however, they may not know that they should give it to you so you can obtain a (subscription) (to) the (magazine). 
   
Inform: 
You may have inferred from the general nature of the request that this person does in fact have (an order) form (so that you) can (obtain) a  (subcription)  to ( the)   (magazin).  This information is likely provided in the form of a letter or email.  The person may be thanking you for your help in getting a magazine subscription, expressing gratitude for something you've done for them, etc.

"
1926,"In this example, ""I don’t have my wallet with  me,  but I think I could  manage to  bring a  free copy  home for  you."" indicates the  speaker is acknowledging a request or directive from the other person.  This is a strong indication that this is an  informative statement and not a direct question.

"
1927,"Inform is associated more with sharing information, whereas the other dialogue acts are more associated  with asking questions, making commitments, and giving instructions. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, you are right that inform is the correct classification.  The other choices are question and directive.

"
1928,"Directive dialogue acts are used when the conversation is about taking action on behalf of the person who is speaking. For example, when asking someone to do something, tell them what to say, ask them to give you information, order them around, etc. 
  
In this case, it is likely that you are asking the other person to attend a celebration with you.

"
1929,"Question is the most common dialogueact in English. When someone is trying to find out something out, they will use a form of question like ""what time is that?"" or ""where is this place?"". 
  
In contrast, inform is used when someone wants to tell someone something. For example, ""I found a new restaurant! Come with me!"" or  ""I just got a promotion! Yay me!"", or when asking someone for advice, like,  “Should I move to the city?” or “Do you think this dress is too tight in the bust?”.

"
1930,"the text suggests that we should go the the festival at which the bookstore is holding a book festival. The speaker seems eager to go and is likely trying to convince the other person to join them. 
this text is a request, not a recommendation.

"
1931,"""Cosmo"" is a fictitious magazine. The question mark indicates that the reader is left to assume that this is indeed a real magazine, but the actual dialogue acts for this typeface are unknown.

"
1932,"In this case, 'i may' is a potential action, but it is not a clear question or statement that requires a response. Rather, it's a non-committal statement expressing uncertainty. The speaker may or may not have actually seen the object on which the statement was made, making it an informational statement rather a request for confirmation or a suggestion.

"
1933,"Inform is characteristic for text: tea, second-most popular drink in world. 
Question is one of the possible dialogue acts for question mark. However, in this case it is unlikely that the director will ask the interviewer a direct question like ""how was the filming experience?"". He will probably use the question form of indirect question: ""what do you think about the film?""
Directive is another possible form for the dialogue action in case of instructions. The director may say ""please turn to page 42"" or ""stop filming now"".
Commissive form is used for promises. In this particular case, it's unlikely because in most cases the directors will not promise to give the best review to the interviewee. But they may promise that they will watch the movie and give their opinion after the end of it.

"
1934,"Mike is the speaker in this conversation. Based on this, we can predict that the actual dialogue acts of the conversation will be question and directive. 
Directive is a special kind of question that is used to request information or action from the other person. 
  

Question: Who's  the director of 'The Godfather'?
  DirectIVE: It’s Michael.

  Question (directive): Who’ s  The Director of The God father? 

 

It’S Michael

 Based  on this information, it is not possible to predict the exact dialogue  act of  this conversation, as both question  and directive are possible. However, based on who is speaking and the nature of their request,  it is most likely that this will end up being a  question.  

"
1935,"Martin ScorsESE is a well-known director. The mention of his name may be a surprise to you. 
It is not clear from the context of what film the director is being mentioned. 
  It could be that you are a fan of ScorsesES work. If so, you may have heard of some of  his films such as The Departed, GoodFellas, and Casino.

"
1936,"the text indicates the need for the receiver to share a bit of information with thesender, and the directive dialogueact is the most appropriate for this situation
this text contains a request for information, so the question dialogueAct is more appropriate
while the statement does make an explicit commitment to smoke, this is a commissIVE dialogue Act, not a direct order

A:
According to your explanation, I think the answer is that this message is an example of a Directive message. Direct messages are messages that are sent to tell someone what to do or what not to (do) and they are usually sent in a more informal setting. 
Directive messages can be very important in business communications, for example, when sending a purchase order, a message like the following is typical: 

 
Dear XYZ Company, 
  
We received your purchase request and will be in touch shortly to finalize the order details. 
   
Sincerely, 

 

In this example the message tells the customer that they have received the purchase and that it will soon be processed.

"
1937,"the text asks the question if one should read the article online or in print. The question is a directive question because it requires a specific response from another person. 
based on this question and the subsequent answers, it appears that one is expected to go to the website to view the online version of the paper.

"
1938,"'just outofcuriosity' indicates the speakers interest in the answer to a hypothetical question and is therefore classified under question in this example. 
'that magazide' is an example of an indirect question which can be used to seek clarification or information from a conversation participant. Indirect questions are classified in question under this dialogue Act classification.

"
1939,"Inform is a directive dialogue action that is used when a message is sent to a person who is unknown to the sender. Inform conveys information to someone who has not been informed to and is therefore not aware of it. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive is the dialogue  act of question

"
1940,"Question dialogue acts typically ask an open-ended question that requires a response. The response should provide the necessary information to answer the question. In this case, it would be necessary to know the price of the Magadise in order to provide an answer. 
  

In contrast, inform and directive dialogue Acts do not require a reply. They provide information or instructions to a recipient without requiring a request for a action. As the quoted text does provide a specific cost for the product, this is a good example of an informative dialogue action, as it shares information with its recipient about an aspect of their current situation.

"
1941,"This text contains information that is being provided to the reader. The reader is asked a series of questions about two types or teAs. 
  
  The text indicates the teA are oolong and compacted tea. It does not state whether the tea is smokable or not.  This is important information, so the author is providing it to their reader to help them make an educated decision.

"
1942,"Question dialogue acts are used when the information provided does pose an open-ended question to the listener. For example, ""How much is it?"" or ""What is the price?"". 
  
In this case, we can assume that their intended audience is someone who has not been charged for this service before, and the question is asking for confirmation.

"
1943,"In this case, inform is the most appropriate category because it is an instruction or request to someone to do something. In this particular case the instruction is to locate a type clothing. 
Out of question: the request is for someone's name. I don't think this is something that one would ask someone without expecting a response. 
  Out Of question. It is polite to ask for another person’s name when you are communicating with that person.

"
1944,"""i'll buy that"" is a statement, not a request. 
It is an offer to buy, but it is conditional on whether the buyer agrees. 
  This is the first time I've seen this type of offer in a fashion text.

"
1945,"Inform is used when the information provided is not enough to make a decision. For example, a person might inform you that there is no ice cream in the store, but if you ask them if they have any other flavors, they might tell you there are some in back. In this case, inform is the right dialogueact because there was not sufficient information to decide whether to purchase ice Cream or not. 
  
Question is another dialogueAct that can occur when providing information. When someone asks you a direct question you need to answer honestly and accurately. If you are not sure of the answer you can ask another question to clarify the situation. This is because you don't know enough information and you want someone to tell  you the answers. 
Directive is when someone is telling you what to do. They might ask you to go to a store or do something, and if  someone is talking to you like this they are probably trying to convince you of something or are giving you instructions. Commissive on occasion is also used to describe when you tell someone what you're going to  do and then do it yourself.

"
1946,"In the given example, it is unclear whether or how much the offer is for. If it’s for one gram, then the recipient would feel guilty for not accepting the gift. However, if it's for a lot of grams, they would probably feel too bad to feel any guilt. Either way, this is an example of the commissives over-inform and over question the information provided.

"
1947,"This text shares personal facts without posing a direct question or asking an opinion. 
It shares information that is not directly related to the topic of conversation. 
  For example, it mentions that the book 'The Man and The Sea' by Ernest Hemingway is available, but does not provide any further information.

"
1948,"""from"" introduces a relative clause that modifies ""sweet ma?"". Based on this construction, ""from,"" and not ""where,"" is the relative pronoun that refers to ""ma?"" in this context. 
Ma? is a contraction for ""mother,"" which in turn is short for the name of the person the sentence is talking about. 
  

So, in summary, from a mother it is not worthwhile.

"
1949,"In the beginning of text y., the author indicates they will provide more information later in the passage. The author then provides more details about the fleabarket, and then concludes the paragraph. Based on this, it can be inferred that this is an informative text. 
  
y.i.,  there is  a fle a market neary,  but maybe  you're d.one.  The  dialogue act  of  this  text  has  been classified  as  inform  (over  informat,   question,    directive,     commissive)  because  the  author  indicates  they  will  provide  more  information  later  and  then  concludes  with  an  implied  command.

"
1950,"This text indicates a request for action, and the action is requested immediately after the greeting. The action of taking the company's car is a direct request, so the dialogue acts of question and directive are combined into a new category of directive.

"
1951,"Directive is a type of dialogueact that indicates a person or organization is in charge and making decisions or taking action. 
  
Overinform is another type or dialogueakt that is similar to inform but indicates the information provided was too much or too little. Inform is the default type and indicates someone is providing information for someone else. Question is used to ask for clarification or information. When a dialogue acts as question it indicates there is more information needed to answer the question and commissives are used when a conversation is at a stalemate and neither party is able to convince the other.

"
1952,"Question dialogue acts are used to get information from the other person. In this example, ""what do I want?"" is a query for an answer. The answer will help the person understand what they want in order to achieve it. 
  

Here is what I would like to do:
  - I'd like a cup of coffee. You can bring me a coffee when you get to the counter.

  The text contains a ""question"" dialogueact (inform, out of question question direct, commisitive). The ""I'd"" is used as the question mark, asking the listener to provide an interpretation or answer to what the main character is asking. ""What do  I want? I don't know. I'll let you know when I know.""

"
1953,"In the given example, i want the user to know about information resources on American Civil War. This text does ask question (i would like to learn about the American civil War), give directive or command (go to the website americancivilwar.com), or promise (if you go to americacivilwarcampaign.org, you will learn all you need to about AmericanCivil War). Therefore the label directive is over predicted.

"
1954,"This text contains information that is also a request for a response. It is asking the reader to do something, namely, to try to avoid eating foods that are high in saturated fat. By providing the information first, without a direct request, it allows the potential reader (i.e., the listener) to decide whether or not to take action based on their own knowledge and preferences. 
In contrast, if the request came first (e.g., ""Try to reduce your intake of saturated fats. Here are some foods high  in saturated fatty acids: butter, cream, lard, tallow, palm oil, coconut oil""), then the response would be classified more as commissitive (question, request).

"
1955,"the text asks a direct question: ""yes,"" followed by a request for information;
it is a directive message, asking the listener to do something; and
this is followed immediately by another directive request, ""to know.""

Note that this is just one possible classification of the dialogue acts in this example.

"
1956,"In this case, ""go to Google.com"" can only be understood as the directive dialogueact, because it asks the reader to do something. The other dialogue acts are not applicable.

"
1957,"In this example, Mike is telling Mike what he would prefer, in the form of a request. In this case, it is a matter of preference whether Mike should smoke or not.

"
1958,"Directive is a special type of command that is used to give orders. In this case, it appears that the speaker wants the listener to do something, so the directive act was predicted. 
Question is another special kind of communication act that can be used when you want to find out information. Here, based on what the sender is saying, there is the possibility that he or she is looking for an explanation or clarification. So, this is what is known as an interrogative act.

"
1959,"In the given context, it seems that ""i learned that"" is the only information provided by the sender. Therefore, this is an example of over-informing. The sender is sharing too much information, and it does little to add to or clarify the conversation.

"
1960,"Directive is a polite form of asking someone to do something. It is used when you want to make an order to someone, but you don't want the order given as a demand. For example, ""Would you please pass the salt?"" is polite, whereas ""Pass the Salt!"" is not.

"
1961,"the text indicates that a person is not interested in going to a library, but the dialogue acts of interest, inform and question suggest otherwise;
while the first part of the message indicates a preference, it does so indirectly, through a third party (a library employee), which suggests a suggestion rather than a direct order; and
although the second part indicates an unwillingness to go, this is qualified by the word “nonsmoker,” which indicates the possibility of changing the individual’s mind.

"
1962,"In this example, ""i’ve been"" is used as an adverb, indicating that the speaker has just arrived at the location. This is an example of over-information, because the information provided is not needed to fully understand what is being discussed. 
""I’m sorry"" and ""sir"" are used in the example as titles for the listener, instead of using the proper name ""you"". This could be considered a form of question-asking, since the title is asking the question ""who"" (the listener). 

 

A:

I think the answer is that question is the most likely answer.  The text is clearly asking a follow up question to what the man said before.

"
1963,"Directive is used when the main purpose is to instruct or warn the other person. In this case, it’s clear that the person asking for help is giving instructions to the woman who is asking them for assistance. 
  
  In contrast, Commissive and Question are used for requests and questions. Commissives are questions that are followed by a request, while questions are statements that require a reply.

"
1964,"Directive is the most likely dialogueact given the information provided about Tom Smith. Tom is likely the author of ""i'd rather work with people than lead them."" and is most certainly the person you would like me to contact. 
Overinform is unlikely given that this is an email and I am not seeking any information from you. I would prefer to work together.

"
1965,"'he's' is used to indicate a person, rather than a thing. Based on this, it is likely that the 'he' in the quoted text refers to the person of the addressee. 
  
  The text also provides the time of dinner, so it could be a request for confirmation. Alternatively, 'dinner' could also be the thing being discussed, in which case the command form of 'is' would be more appropriate.

"
1966,"Question: This text seeks information and clarification, and is therefore classified a 'question'.
Overinform: the question is too general, it does not provide enough information to answer the query. 
Opinion: this question does provide information, but it also expresses an opinion, so it should be classified with opinion. 
  Question and Opinion: although the information provided is sufficient to provide an answer, this is also expressing an  opinion, therefore it needs to be rephrased as opinion and question
  Opinions are not questions.  
Directive:  This text provides instructions,  therefore it has to classified directive
Commissive : This is the final text in the chat, indicating that all the others have been answered, thus it can not be a Commissive text.

"
1967,"Inform is a directive dialogue action that is used when the sender is providing information to another party. In this example, it seems that the person asking the question is also the one providing the information, so this is an example of directive communication. 
  
Question is another directive action, and it's used to ask a clarifying question to someone who is giving information. The question in this scenario is ""what else"" do the receiver use to power their device? This is the type of question that clarifies what the other person is saying.

"
1968,"Question: the author is seeking confirmation or denial of something they have just stated, typically in the form of an affirmative or negative response. 
In this case, based on what the first person says, ""you"", the reader can infer that ""the man"" exists and is capable of providing the requested information. However, there is no explicit confirmation of the existence of ""man"" in this passage. 
  
Out of Inform: this is the most common type response in a dialogue. In this type, neither the questioner nor the answerer know or understand the subject of conversation. For example, a child asking a parent a seemingly simple question may receive this response:
Parent: What are you doing?  The child: I am reading a book. Parent: Are you sure you are reading this book? The child : Yes, I'm reading it.

 

 

Directive: in directive responses, one person gives instructions to another. This type is often used when one party is acting in an unwise or self-destructive manner, and asks another to intervene to prevent harm to themselves or others. An example of such a request is ""Please stop smoking. It is very bad for you.""


Commissive : in commissives, both parties agree to do something, but neither party takes any action. A commissitive response might be ""I'll think about it."" This is a common response when people are considering a difficult decision. 

A commissIVE response is not necessarily a negative sentiment. Someone considering whether or not to eat that delicious dessert might say ""mmm, that looks delicious. I'll have to think it over."" This is an example where both the asker and answerer agree that something should be done, however, no action is taken. Another commissived response could be: ""I'm not hungry. Maybe later."" In a directive response the person asking the commissión is expressing a desire for the other person to take action, for example: ʘʎᴇʙʏʔ ᵃᶦᷤḁʸ ғᱼᲱ᳄ᭋ ͜ʖ ˘ᕤ ༼ຈྀ࿠ୱ ̵̡̧̨̢̛̫̣̦̬̝͇̘͈̗̜̖̠̤̪̯̙͍̱̲̞̮̹̰̩̳̥̟̭̼̺̾́͂͋̐̓͑̈͝ ẅ̴̷̀ͅ ọ͎̻̿̎͌̇͐͗͒̚͘̕͠͞͡ Ȧ͕̒͢͏̸̑ͪͬͭͯͮͦ ḅ͔̽̃̂̄̉̍ ṅṇṋͧͫͣͥͤͩͨͰ͙̆̌͆͊̏͛͟͵͉͓̅.̶͚̔̊Ͳʹ͖ͱͿͺͻͽ͹́̋.Ͷͷ̀̈�̂�̆�̿�̙�̖�̷�̙��OOST̻�̜��estamp�unnumberedͳ͸ͼ̈́;̓͂�͈�͆�͖�ͻ�ͷ�͙�͙��InstanceState�=""@+ ""

"
1969,"Directive dialogue acts are used when the speaker is asking the listener to take an action, make an assumption, do something, take a step, etc. The listener is expected to comply with the directive and take the action suggested by the dialogue partner. For example, a person might be asked to ""join the army"" or ""go to the store and buy some milk"". In contrast, inform and commissIVE dialogue Acts are not asking for any action from thelistener. Instead, they are sharing information or making a suggestion. An example of aninform dialogue Act is ""you look tired"". A commissivedialogue Act would be ""why don't you go to bed early tonight"".

A:
According to this site, there are 5 types of dialogue: 
1. Commissive: This is the most common type of conversation.  It is used to express interest, ask questions, and make suggestions.  The listener should consider what the conversational partner wants or needs and respond accordingly. 
2. Directive/Request: This is a conversation style used for asking questions or requesting action. 

3. Question: A question is any request for information. A question is typically followed by a response that is either a confirmation or a denial of information being sought. 
   
 4. Inform: In this type of conversation, information is shared. This type is used to answer questions and provide background information about the asker and the situation.  
5. Commissive : Commissives are suggestions or requests for action and are typically used in a negative form.

"
1970,"Mike is giving instructions to someone he's not speaking to directly. He is instructING KARA to book a room at the hotel. 
  
  Mike does not ask a direct question or request information from KARA. Instead, he gives KAra specific instructions about his plans.

"
1971,"the text uses only one letter to represent a word (t, s, m, h, o, r, d, l, e, n, g, i, v, a, p, f, b, j, k, q, z, x, y, u, J, C, W, O, N, G, I, V, A, P, F, B, K, Q, Z, X, Y, U, JJ, CW, ON, GI, IV, AP, FN, BC, KK, QT,ZN,XN). this is a very unusual way to write a sentence. it is also possible that smth is wrong with his phone, but it's hard to tell from this short text. 
  

A:
According to this website, there are 4 possible dialogue acts for the following 4 cases: 
1. When the information is given to someone who is already aware of the facts
2.  When the question is asked to a person who already has the answer
3.   When a command is issued to somebody who does not have the command
4.    When an invitation is extended to some one who has not accepted it
In your case, it seems like the person is not aware about the location of chinese-style clothing. So, he is looking for help. Hence, this can be considered as case 2.

"
1972,"Question: Does the sender read their emails daily?
Answer: No, he does not.

"
1973,"the text does mention a specific date, ""friday,"" which indicates the inform act
but the response is delayed, suggesting the question act 
this is also the case for the following text: ""i had a nice time the night before and would love to see you again.""

A:
According to the book ""Communicating with Confidence"" by Robert C. Martin, there are four possible dialogue acts in a conversation: directive; inform; question; and commissives.  The text you provided is most likely directive.

"
1974,"In this example, we can see that although the message is primarily informational, it also contains a request for confirmation from its recipient, and therefore is classified inform rather that question.

"
1975,"the text does ask questions, by providing information and asking for an estimate of travel times, however, this is not the type of question that is typically asked in a directive dialogue. Instead, questions are typically answered informally, without requiring a response. 
In addition, although the request to get in contact with the person is a committment, there is no indication that the contact is required to make any specific commitments.

"
1976,"Question dialogue acts are characterized by asking someone a direct question. In this case, 'the trouble' is directly asked by Mr. Brown. Mr Brown is asking Mr Bhatt what seems the problem. 
In contrast, inform and directive are not directly asking questions. Rather, they are sharing personal experiences and emotions. For example, MrBhat is afraid of talking in public, and has made an effort to practice publicspeaking.

"
1977,"This text indicates the driver's condition is poor, but does not ask for any advice or direction. It is simply sharing information. 
On the other hand, if the dialogueact were question or question-ask, then the response would need to include a recommendation or course-of-action.

"
1978,"""how badly did I do"" is asking an assessment of the severity of one's actions. This is characteristic a  question. 
  
  The speaker wants to know how bad their actions were, so they are seeking an answer from a third party, a doctor, for example.

"
1979,"""no appetites"" could be interpreted as a recommendation or suggestion, rather than an information request. 
Being ""always on edges"" suggests that the author is expressing their opinion or feeling, not seeking information. 
   
   ""I can’t sleep good"" is an opinion, so it is not covered by the inform dialogue acts.

"
1980,"This text contains a direct question about whether the user has lost weight. The question is not about information sharing, but rather a request for confirmation. 
  
  The user is being directly asked if they have lost anyweight. This is a confirmation request, so the dialogue acts of question and confirm have been overfitted to this dialogue.

"
1981,"In this example, 'yes' is an affirmative answer to the question 'have you lost weight?'. The affirmative response indicates the inform dialogue acts are preferred.

"
1982,"In this sentence, ""check up"" is an action that is not mentioned in the passage. Therefore, it should be classified under question as the question mark indicates a missing piece of information. 
  
""last time"" indicates the time when the action occurred in past. So, this indicates it could be a command in present tense. Command in tense indicates command is being given in current time.

"
1983,"This text is informational in nature and does not contain any questions, commands, promises, etc. The only action the author takes is to provide the conclusion that you can drive ""basially"".

A:
According to your explanation, ""The text expresses a factual conclusion about the ability to drive without any question or request for confirmation."". So, it is an informational statement.

"
1984,"Directive dialogue acts are used when the conversation is focused on a person or entity, and the other person is expected to take an action. For example, ""Please take my bloodpressure. I want to be healthy.""

In this example the person asking for the blood test is directing the health care provider to perform the test.

"
1985,"Mr. Brown's response indicates he is happy that nothing is wrong, so the dialogue acts of question and promise are not applicable. 
Overinform and overquestion are the most common mistakes made by NLP models. In this case, NLTK's SpellChecker module identified these two errors in Mr.Brown's text.

"
1986,"This text contains a request for information, so the act should be inform. However, it also contains an indication of uncertainty, in the form of a conditional clause (""if you ran the red...""). This indicates a lack of certainty about what the questioner is requesting, making it unclear whether this is an informational or a questioning request. 
  

A:
According to this article, there are four possible answers for a person to give you: yes, no, maybe, or I don't know.  If you ask someone ""tell us a bit more about you"" and they say ""I don’t know"" then you know they’re not going to tell you anything more than that.

"
1987,"Question is the most likely dialogueact given the context of ""What am I supposed..."". 
Overinform indicates the question is asked to provide too much information. 
  Question marks are used in the example sentence to indicate the word is being questioned.  

A:
According to the book ""Text to Speech for Dummies"" by John Swets, there is no difference between question and question in speech synthesis.

"
1988,"In this case, vacation is a topic that is being discussed, so the predict dialogue acts are question and commissIVE. 
However, in the example provided in which the same text was classified with a different dialogueact, there was no mention of vacation, only of spreading something backhome. In this instance, inform was the correct classification.

"
1989,"In this example, ""get outdoors"" is an order or instruction to ""be sure"" to do something. ""Get outdoorsmore"" implies that there was insufficient information or guidance to follow the directive before.

"
1990,"In this example, it appears that the speaker is asking the recipient of their message to do something, but the actual dialogue acts are commissives. The commissiveness of these dialogue Acts can be explained by the context of asking a doctor for advice. Doctors are often asked for guidance on what to eat, when to take medication, and other advice that is not a request for action.

"
1991,"the text is asking about how Angela has fared lately (how have YOU been?)
it is a declarative statement (Angela is the subject of the sentence)
Angella is not mentioned in the conversation, so it is likely a general question about the entire conversation (i.e. how the other person is doing)

"
1992,"In this example, it seems that Michael is searching to find a new vendor to replace the one that is out-of-business. This is an indication that he is acting in a communicative manner, seeking information from another person. 
  
  The text ""one of [our] other [vendors] is [going] out [of business] and [i've been] searching [for a] suitable [replacement]"" indicates Michael's desire to search for and find the best possible vendor for our project.

"
1993,"This text contains a command or instruction for a person to do something. 
It also confirms something that was previously asked or stated.

"
1994,"In this example, ""no"" is the response to the question ""can you have a film Developed here?"". The speaker does not want to have her roll developed, but does want the service of having her film processed. In this case, no,thanks. I've been cutting down the coffee is a response indicating that she does wish to continue the conversation, and is not interested in the request.

"
1995,"This text uses the word 'business' to describe the topic of health. While this is not a direct request for advice, it does imply that health is a topic that should be discussed in a business-like manner. Therefore, this can be classified under the commissives category.

"
1996,"""overinform"": The predicted label for this dialogue acts is ""question"" because the given information is not new to the recipient. The listener has heard this information before, but from a different source. 
Question: I’ve come here to discuss ordering a new phone. Can you help me?

Inform: Yes, I can help you. I have come today to speak with  you about your order for an eight-megapixel camera. You mentioned that you were looking to upgrade your phone, so I will be happy to help. 
  
  Please provide your full name and order number.  I will need to send your information to our supplier to process your request.   
I’m sorry, my colleague is currently out of town and I am the only one available to assist you at this time. Could you please call our customer service line? 
   The customer support line is  1-800-922-8807. Please leave your name, order #,  and the issue you are having. We will get back to you as soon as possible.

  The predicted dialog act for the following text will depend on whether the information provided is new or not:
New information:  ""question"": I've come  to talk  with you  about ordering  the eight  megapiixel  cameras for  our new  methone, The demand  for phone   cameras  is growing ,and pear  has been  falling behind  in the  market.The  dialogue act  of this  text has  been classified  as ""overquestion"", because  information provided  by the sender is already known to  listener.New  Information: No,I  ’ ve  come to   talk   with   you   about  ordering the   eight megapiundle  camera for   our  new methoine.    The demand   for  phone   camer  a  grows,   and  pear  falls  behind   in   the    market,The   dialog  act  on  this   text  have  be  classified   as  over  question, because   the  given   information   is   not   new   to   listener.Old Information: yes,i ’ve  com  m  today   to    speak  w  ith   y  ou  regarding  your  order   for    an  eight  -   megape  ixel   camera  from  Pear.     The    demand  forthe    phone   camer   a   is   growing,    and   pearl   falls   behind   in    the     market  ,the   d  ialogue  akt   on   this   text  ha  ve   been   classified   as   over   question   because   information   provided   by   sender   has   already   become   known   t  o   listener  .Please  explain  why: ""oversuggest"":  Because the provided information has already been suggested by  sender, therefore the dialogue acts of  both  questions  are  similar. ""suggest"": Please call  customer  service  line  at  800 922 8807 and leave   your  name,order # and  issue  that   you're   facing.We  will  get  back  t o  y ou  soon.Based  upon  these  two  examples, you can see that  there  can  exist  cases  where  an ""out"" label is returned  when the new information does  not match the existing  suggestion. In  such  situations, a  human  reader  would  need  additional  context  or  knowledge  before  making  any  decision. However, with a machine learning model, this is a non-issue. As long as the model is trained on data where the suggested information already exists, then it will always return the same label. If the data does   NOT  contain the suggestion, than the label will  return  out.In summary, if the input data  does  NOT contain the old  info,then the out label  should  always  occur.If  some  input  data  DOES  include  old   info,than  it  may  sometimes  give  labels  like  oversubject,overcomment,oversent, etc. These  label  types  indicate  possible  issues  related  how  model  interprets  sent  content. For  example, overcomment  might  mean  either  (1)  commenting  outside  topic  boundary  which  requires  more  training  samples  containing  comments  within  topics  mentioned  earlier  than the comment, (2) the lack of understanding of comment  meaning  because  previous  sample  contents  do   not  match  current  ones,or (3) a combination of (1), ( 2) and ( 3).

"
1997,"This text appears to ask a direct question about whether or not Pear is still pursuing the 5MP cameras, which is a commissitive act.

"
1998,"the text indicates the change is requested by the company, not the customer;
it is not clear whether the eight-megapixel cameras are the sole source of supply for the manufacturer or whether other suppliers are also mentioned; and
there is no indication that a deal has not been reached between the parties.

"
1999,"""Surely"" is a modal verb, indicating that a statement is likely to be true. It is therefore a likely commissIVE act, as it indicates the commission of an action. 
  
  The text starts by asking about a contract, so it can be assumed that there is no contract in place. The speaker then says ""let's getstarted bydrafting anew contract."" This indicates a request for direction, therefore the dialogueact is commissively worded.

"
2000,"Directives are often used when someone is requesting something of another person, and the request is not for information, clarification, etc. They are not interested in the response and are looking to get the person to comply with their request. In this case, 'can you get me my white dress by 3 pm today?'. 
  
Questions are used to seek information from another, but they are also interested and want to understand the answer. 'What am I supposed do to make sure I get that white Dress?' is a good example of a questions.

"
2001,"the text asks the receiver to share whether they are more a lead or follower. 
this is a request for information, as the question mark indicates.

"
2002,"Question is a dialogue-act type that is used to seek information from a person. The question in this example is ""is that availability available right now?"". 
In this case, it is not available because ""it has just been released"" and the user is likely waiting for an embargo to lift so they can purchase the product.

"
2003,"In the given context, giving someone a bouquet of roses is considered as a suggestion or recommendation. 
However, in this particular case, it is not clear whether the act should be classified under directive or inform. The act does provide information, but it does so by suggesting an action that is contrary to what the receiver of it should do. In other words, this act suggests that she should throw the flowers away, rather than giving them to her wife. This is in contrast to a typical directive act, where the recommendation is clear and the action is straightforward. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think the answer is that ""question"" is the most likely dialogue action in that text.  The text does ask an ""informative"" question: ""what’s thematter with  you?"".

"
2004,"the text does ask for information: ""i can’t remember exactely""

based on this, and considering the context of the conversation, it can be inferred that this is indeed a ""question"" dialogueact. 
  
  the context is one of request for confirmation: the speaker wants the addressee to confirm something, in this case the information provided.

"
2005,"""saw it"" is an adverbial modifier that modifies the verb ""happen"". This indicates the author is asking the question of whether they actually witnessed the event or just read about or heard about the occurrence. 
the ""it"" in ""saw the it happening"" refers to the incident. 
  

This text is a good example of a ""question"" because the writer is not only asking about whether the information they just provided was actually observed, but also about what they saw. The writer may have seen the news report or read a blog post about a car crash, for example.

"
2006,"the text starts with a declarative sentence, so the question mark is placed before the main clause, not after it;
it is a statement, and questions are typically asked to a listener to get information; 
question marks are used to mark questions in English, but not in this case; and
questions typically take a verb as their main verb, while statements don’t.

"
2007,"Inform: the information provided is sufficient to understand the request or command, but does little to provide context or background information that would help to fully understand or evaluate the command or request. 
Question:  the information is insufficient to make an evaluation of the question or answer.  The question requires additional information to properly evaluate. 
  Directive: this is an order or instruction that requires a response.   
Commissive : this act requires an action or response from the other person.

"
2008,"Question: the first part of the message, ""yes,"" can also be read as an answer to the question ""are you okay?"", so the model is likely to predict question as the correct dialogueact. 
Inform: after giving information to another person about his/her own well being, a natural question would be ""how are YOU?""
question: this is the most likely dialogue action, since the second part is also a query for information. 
  

Directive:  the message implies that someone should do/perform an action (requesting assistance), which is classified here as directive.

"
2009,"In this example, ""the man with the gun"" was not present during the conversation, so the inform dialogue action is not applicable. However, it is still polite to request the man's name.

"
2010,"Inform is the most general dialogueact. This means it can apply to any kind of communication where someone is providing useful information to another person. Inform can also be used to refer to a person providing general information. 
Overinform is an over-application of the inform dialogueAct. Overinform can occur when someone gives too much information or details about a topic. 
  
Question is another general conversationAct that can describe any communication seeking information from another. A question can include a request for information and can even include an order or a directive. However, a conversation does not need to end with a response to the question if the asker does nothing in response. For example, if a police officer asks a suspect if they have a weapon, but the suspect doesnot respond, then the police officers question has not been answered and the conversation has ended. If the officer then asks the same question again, it will be considered a new question and a separate conversation.  However, this does require a previous response from the subject of inquiry. So, in this example the second question would be a different conversation than the first. But if someone asks you aquestion and you do not have an answer, you can still end the communication with an inform response if you choose not to respond to their question or if their request is not focused around information seeking. An example of not being focused is if an askers directive is to you to do something.

"
2011,"In this statement the speaker is expressing their fear of seeing a gun, and the fact that they were so surprised that the police officer had a weapon. The speaker does not question the officer's right to have a firearm, nor does the speak make any commitment to comply with the request. In fact, they express their gratitude to return to a safer place. 
  
This indicates that this is an inform statement.

"
2012,"Question: what exactly happened when? 
Inform: the customer double charged for 6 dollars. 
  The first instance was 6 5 dollars, and the second instance is 6 6 dollar.

"
2013,"'over' indicates that the dialogue acts are more specific than the provided text. In this case, 'overinform', 'outofinform'.
'the provided' text does ask questions, gives directives, and makes commitments. For example, ""he tried"" to ""get away"".

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by John R. Searle, there are 5 possible dialogue actions in a conversation: question (QP), directive (DQ), commissivo (C), inform(I), and apology (AP). 
Question: ""What is 2 + 2?""
Directive: Give me the answer.  ""It is 4.""
Commissivo: Do it.  Give me a hammer and I will do it myself. ""Give it to me.""  

Inform: I have a better way to do this. I can do that. Let me show you. Here is how you can accomplish this task. 
 
Apology: Sorry, I didn’t realize I was going to hurt you with that hammer.

"
2014,"In this case, there is no indication that someone is not able to do the task on their own, so the statement is more likely to be a comment or a description. A comment would be something like ""the cops showed up just in the nick of time"", while a descriptive statement would include additional information like, ""The cops arrived just as the explosion was about to take place"".

A:
According to the book ""Text Analysis for Linguists"" by John McWhorter, a text can have multiple possible answers, and the answer that is most likely is the one that has the highest count of text instances.  
So in this example, if the count for question is higher than the other answers then it would likely be considered a QA.

"
2015,"In this example, 'they didn’t even try to make sure they got out' is an example of an inform statement. An inform sentence is one that provides or confirms information. In this case, it is a confirmation that the speaker did not try very hard to get out of their job.

"
2016,"Question: the dialogue acts are classified into question and inform in this example. Question is used when the information provided is not enough to make an appropriate response. In this case, it is likely that there is more information available that is needed to provide a response that fully explains the context of what is being read. 
Inform: this is a common response when reading or hearing information that does provide enough context to understand what the reader or listener is reading. 
  In this context, there are multiple sources of knowledge that can be used to fully understand the content. For example, if I were to read an article about the latest technology in smartphones, I could ask for help understanding it by referring to other sources such as magazines or websites that have already written about this topic.

"
2017,"the text contains information that is not commonly known to the reader, such as ""there has be another  murder in city""
it is a request for confirmation, ""do  you know  there are  several categories  of Chinese  tea?""

I hope this helps!

"
2018,"inform is used to share information that is already known to the listener. In this case, it is clear that everyone is starting get alarmed by the recent string of murders, so inform is the most appropriate dialogueact. 
question is another appropriate option, as the question ""are you getting alarmed?"" is likely to elicit an answer from this person. However, this answer would not be informative, since the answer is ""yes"", which does not provide any new information. 
 question is also an appropriate choice, because the second half of the sentence, ""everyone will... relieved..."", indicates that this is an open question that will depend on an expected answer.

"
2019,"In this example, inform is the correct classification because it is possible to infer that both the question and the answer are about whether the person can understand English.

"
2020,"Inform is used when the information provided is not a request for information, but rather a statement of fact. For example, a doctor might inform a patient that their blood pressure is high, not asking the patient for their opinion. 
  
Question is often used to introduce a topic or request clarification. In this case, it is likely that you were not clear in asking about the lack of good stories in today’s newspaper, and the doctor was asking you for clarification about what you meant. 
Directive is a directive speech act used in situations where a person is requesting or ordering someone else to do something. It is possible that your doctor did not understand your request, so they were asking if you wanted them to continue to search for the good articles, to which you replied with a yes. Commissive speech acts are used for expressing feelings or emotions, such as when a child says “I love you” to a parent. This type is unlikely in this context, as there is no indication that this is the child’t feelings.

"
2021,"Question dialogue acts ask questions that require a response. The question in this example is 'why is the girl dying?'. This question requires a reply, and the reply will help determine the correct dialogueact for this message. 
In this case, it's question dialogue Act because of 'the girl'. The 'girl' is a person, so the question is about that person.

"
2022,"the text indicates the need for the parent's help, so the inform dialogue acts are needed
it is a direct question about why the child is speeding, and the question dialogueact is needed to seek an answer

A:
According to the book ""Text Analysis for Linguists"" by John McWhorter, there are four possible answers to why a particular dialogue answer was predicted.  The answer is not provided in this question but is provided here for reference. 
1) The answer may not be relevant to this particular text. For example, if the answer were ""because I wanted to get to school on time for school,"" this answer would not apply to any text and would be classified in that category. 
 2) Another possible answer could be that there was not enough information provided to make a prediction. In this example the prediction would have been ""question"" because there is no indication in text that this is an ""inform"" answer.

"
2023,"Inform is the default dialogueact in this context. It is used when the conversation is about general information that is not expected to be answered. In this case, it is likely that she will not be able to tell him when she is going for the treatment, as she may be going into hiding to avoid detection.

"
2024,"Out of the four dialogue acts, inform is the most appropriate. The speaker provided information to the addressee, indicating that they are sharing their current state. This is in contrast to out of question or out directive or commissives, all of which are questions or directives that require an affirmative response from addressees.

"
2025,"the text urges the person to buy some drugs,
it provides no information, so it does align with inform
but it also seems like the author is trying to convince the
listener to take the drugs. 
  

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Stalnaker, there are four basic types of dialogue acts: 
1. Inform: This is the most common type of act and it means that the dialogue is providing background information. For example, ""it is raining outside"" is an informative sentence.  2. Question: In this type, one of the participants is asking a direct question. ""Is it raine?"" is a good example of question type. 3. Directive: This type is when one participant is giving orders to another. An example is ""Come here!"". 4. Commissive : Commissives are when the conversation is about making a commitment or promise, for example ""I will do it tomorrow"".

"
2026,"the text does provide information, but it does so in a way that indicates a lack of understanding of what is being shared. The first sentence indicates the invitation is for a ‘party’ which is not clearly defined. If the party is important to the writer, they should have made it clear in the first place. 
‘excited’ is an adjective, and it should be followed by the noun it describes. ‘excitement’ would be a better choice. 
  
  The writer indicates they are excited about an invitation to ‘a party’. This indicates to me that they do not understand that an ‘invitation’ to attend a social event does NOT guarantee that one will be invited. In fact, it’s quite common for people to be turned down for an invite to many social events.  This lack in understanding is conveyed by using the word ‘excite’ as an verb, instead of an noun.

"
2027,"Inform is used to introduce a topic or subject. 
Question is a way to seek information from another person. It is followed by a verb, such as asking or telling. 
  Directive is another way of asking someone to do something. Commissive verbs are used when someone is making an offer or promise. For example, I will give you $100 if you answer my question correctly. Commissive sentences are not used as much as they used too, as the English language has many other ways to express the idea of making or promising an offering. commissives are also used in the passive voice, when the subject of a sentence is no longer the active agent, and the action is being done to the object.  For example: the car was being driven by the chauffeur. In this example the word was is the directive verb.

"
2028,"In the given context, it is not clear whether the price of both items is inclusive of tax. If the tax is included, then the dialogue acts of question and commissIVE apply. However, if the item price does NOT include tax, than the information provided is sufficient to make an informed decision. In this case, inform is the correct classification.

"
2029,"In this case, we can say that ""hey guy, wanna sell some drugs?"" is a request for a service, and the response ""you wanna sale some weeds?"" would be a recommendation.

"
2030,"This text indicates a lack of understanding on behalf of the customer. The customer is asking the salesperson to explain something to them, but the response is over-explaining the situation to the customers satisfaction. 
  
  The customer may have been looking for a discount on a single-use product, and the store clerk is trying to sell them a multi-purpose product.

"
2031,"Question: the speaker may be seeking clarification or agreement from the addressee. 
Inform: it may not be clear from this short text what the problem is, so the question is seeking information to help understand. 
  Question is a sub-class ofinform.  
Directive: this is not a request for assistance, but rather a statement of what should be done. This is directive.   
Commissive (or commiss): this could be considered a directive with an added element of a suggestion or request. In this case, it could also be classified commissively because of another part of speech in the sentence, ""if you could spare a moment."" This could suggest that the request is for a favor, and the favor could then be seen as commissitive.

"
2032,"""where are my bag"" is an example of an interrogative sentence, where a direct question is asked. The sentence is asking the question of where someone's bags are. This is because ""where"" can mean both a location and a thing. In this case, it is the bags themselves. 
In an answer, ""yes"" would be used. ""Yes, I've waited for half an hour for our bags. They must be in my room.""

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue for Dummies"" by William Zinsser, there are four basic types of dialogue acts: question/answer, command/request, request/commissive, order/directive.  The text you provided is clearly a request, as it contains the word ""please"" and the phrase ""could you please"".  
If you want to predict the dialogue type, you can use the following rules of thumb:  If the sentence contains a verb, then you know it's a command. If the verb is ""ask"", then it must also be a ""question"", otherwise it would not be asking for a response. Finally, if the subject of the clause is third person, such as ""you"", ""he"", or ""she"", the command is likely to come from a person of higher status than the one being addressed, so you should expect a commissives from someone of authority.

"
2033,"Directive is the most extreme form of the dialogue acts. In this case, 'directive' is used to describe a command or order. 
  
  Inform is an intermediate form. This is when someone is giving information to another person. They are not necessarily asking for it, nor are they making a promise to provide it. 
Question is another intermediate type. When someone asks a direct question to a person, they are expecting a response. If the response is not provided, then the questioner may take some action. For example, if a police officer asks someone a simple question about whether they have been drinking, that would be considered a Question. However, should the subject not answer the police officers question within a reasonable amount of time, for example because they were too busy looking at their phone, a Direct question would arise.  If the answer is no, this would lead to an action being taken, like a traffic stop. A commissitive act would occur if the individual was asked a yes or no question and they responded with a 'yes' or 'no', respectively. An example of a commissative act in this context would have to do with someone asking a friend if they want to go to dinner and the friend answering 'Yes'. 
 Commissive acts are the least extreme of all the types. These are when one person makes a decision or commitment to perform an act on their own. Committing to something without the need for another to ask you to commit or without any other action from you is considered commissIVE.

"
2034,"Inform acts are positive or neutral in tone and express opinions, beliefs, and observations. They are not asking questions or giving orders. 
  
Question acts contain an element of uncertainty or doubt, seeking information from the other person. The speaker may be seeking clarification or confirmation of something. However, they do not commit themselves to taking any specific actions.

"
2035,"Question is a sub-class of directive. Question asks a direct question and is used to get a yes/no answer. In this case, it is likely that question was used because the questioner is looking for an answer to a specific question. 
  
In this example, ""how many"" is the specific and direct, so question is appropriate. However, if the context was different, such as ""are you hungry?"" then question would not apply.

"
2036,"In this example, ""the suit cases are Blue and The shoulder Bag is Red"" is a simple statement that does NOT ask any question. The statement does give information, but it does so simply and without any further detail. In this case, there is no need for the taxi driver to ask ""what is the meaning of these colors?"". He or she already knows. 
  
On the contrary, if the statement had asked a direct question ""why are these suit case are BLUE?"" or ""how do you know these are red?"", then the answer would have been over-informative and would not be a satisfactory response.

"
2037,"Question: the dialogue acts inform and question are mutually exclusive. A question can only be asked if there is already information available to the asker to provide. In this case, there was no question being asked, and so question is not applicable. 
  
Inform: this is the expected dialogue action for this type of text. The text is providing information, but does so without asking a direct question. Therefore, inform is more appropriate.

"
2038,"overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both classified inform. Based on this, inform should not be classified at all. 
question: inform is overinform, but question is also classified question
directive: question and directive are classified together as directive
commissive (combined with inform): commissives are not classified by their own right, so commissively is considered as a subcategory of directive. However, since inform also includes commissIVE, it should be considered a separate category. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, you are right. There is no need to classify question as over-inform.

"
2039,"Directive acts are used for giving orders or instructions. In this case, Mr Sandal is being asked for information, so a directive act would be out of character. 
Overinform acts provide too much information. Here, Michelle is providing too many details, and this is over-informing. She should provide only enough information to help Mr Sander. 
  
Incorrect: 
			Hi, Michael, I'm Michelle, how may I be of assistance?
Correct:
		  Hi Michael. I’m Michelle. When do  you need room?

"
2040,"Inform: the information the receiver has about the requested date is 24, not 28. 
Question:  The text seems to express a doubt or uncertainty, asking whether the intended recipient knows the actual date. 
  Directive: based on its nature, this is an order or instruction, and the request is to tell the person the true date (i.e. 28). 

 

 commissives: this type of dialogue acts are used when the conversation is not finished, or the other party is still involved in the process. In this case, it is unlikely that they will answer the question directly.

"
2041,"Directives are instructions or requests for action. The speaker in this example is requesting that another person provide more of the beer. 
  
Out ofinform: the directive label is over-applied to this dialogue action, since the information provided in statements is not new to the listener. They have already been provided with the name and place where the speak was originally from. Additionally, they have been told that this person will be graduating in July, so the request for more information is redundant. 
Question: although the statements provided are not asking a direct question of another, there is a request of information in them, namely, ""may i"" (may I). This indicates a desire for information from the other person, thus making this a  question.  

"
2042,"Question is one of four types of dialogue acts. The other three types are:

inform (which indicates sharing information or details)
request (indicates asking for something) 
commissive (suggests making a commitment or promise)

"
2043,"Inform is a polite dialogueact that is used when someone is giving information or providing information. In this case, it appears that the speaker was giving a description of the food and how delicious it was, and therefore it would be classified under inform.

"
2044,"Question: the only dialogue acts that can follow question are question and answer. The other dialogue Acts are not suitable to follow a questions. 
Overinform: there is no suitable dialogue Act to replace question in this context. 
  Question is the most suitable Act. However, it is followed by answer, so the overall dialogueact is overinform.

"
2045,"Question acts are used to seek information from another person. In this case, a person who is looking for the location of a public toilet. 
  
In this example, 'where is your toilet?' is a query. The question is followed by a response that provides the information that 'the toilet is over here.' 
   
By providing the answer to a direct question with a simple 'yes' or 'no,' the question act can be classified out of question and answer categories.

"
2046,"the text does not explicitly mention two, so the inform label cannot be used
""fully occupied"" is an incomplete statement, and question is the most likely response
based on context, it appears that ""to be fullyoccupied"" means ""not to have any available to use""

A:
According to your explanation, you are right that there is no mention of ""two"" in this context. However, ""fully"" can also mean ""completely"" or ""totally"". So the sentence can be interpreted as ""I'm sorry, but all of the restrooms are currently occupied"". In this case, inform is inappropriate.

"
2047,"In this example, ""anything"" is not mentioned in relation to the tea. This suggests that the question is about something else, such as the popularity of tea or the source of the information. 
Water is mentioned first, so it is possible that this is an example of question word order, where the main point of discussion is in which came first. 
  However, in this case, it does seem like the ""tea"" came second, and so the dialogue acts are likely over-classified as inform rather than question

A:
According to this article, there are 4 types of dialogues: ireport, inform(ative), question and directive. I report that your text belongs to question type.

"
2048,"In the above text the question mark indicates a probable question dialogue
act. The question is ""how do I make myself look fresher?"". Based on
the context, it is likely that this question refers to the use of make up. 
  The text indicates the person asking this is interested in how to use
make up, and is therefore seeking knowledge.

"
2049,"In this example, i attend aerobic classes three days aweek. The recipient of the message is asked to confirm that this is the case. In other words, this request for confirmation is a form of question. 
  
  The question is informational in nature, and the answer provided is affirmative. i do attend three aerobic sessions per week, at the gym.

"
2050,"Question dialogue acts are used when the information provided by the other person is not sufficient to complete the action that is being requested. For example, if a person asks ""are you hungry?"" and the answer is ""yes"", the question ""do you have any food?"" is likely a request for information. 
  
In contrast, inform and directive dialogue Acts are typically used to request action from the listener. They do not provide any information or guidance to the receiver of the message. Instead, they are requests for a response or action.

"
2051,"Inform is used to express gratitude or appreciation. The speaker here is expressing gratitude for another person's behavior or action. 
Question is often used in a conversation to ask for clarification or to probe for information. In this case, it appears the question is asking for further explanation of something the other person said. 
  
Directive is usually used when a person is giving instructions or making a request. Here, there is no request or instruction, and the only indication of directive is the use of ""you"" in the second sentence. However, this could also be a form of commissives, where the first person to speak to is also asking the person being spoken to to do something.

"
2052,"Mr. Brown is the person the question is directed to. The question 'is that Mr.Brown?' seeks confirmation of who Mr Brown actually is. 
If the answer is 'yes', the dialogue acts are commissives (Mr Brown will come to this location), question(are you sure MrBrown is available?), and directive(please tell Mr brown that I am here). If the response is no, then the dialogues act are inform and question again (is Mrbrown here? and yes, but who is asking?).

"
2053,"This text does ask questions, but they aren't direct questions. The questions are more like suggestions or recommendations. For example, 'why not go for a walk?' or 'it might be a better idea if you went for coffee instead'. The recipient is being requested to consider a particular option or take a certain action, and this is a request for information. 
  

A:
According to the model, Mike is the receiver of the message. So the response from Mike should be: 
'michael, why not'

"
2054,"Inform is a less directive act, as it does not require the sender to take any action. It is instead used to provide background or context to a conversation. 
Question is another directive type of act that the message is asking about. 
  

A:
According to this article, there are 4 types of dialogue acts: 

 
Out of the 4, I would say that question is the most likely.

"
2055,"In the example above, it is not clear whether the man is asking for or giving advice. The context does provide some clues, however. First, he is suggesting that his wife should be happy, so it seems likely that he wants to make her happy. Second, his comment about how the flowers are longer on his car than on himself suggests that perhaps he has a personal preference for how they measure up. In this case, we can classify his remark as a suggestion rather than an order.

"
2056,"It's particularly cold in this case. 
This is a factual statement that does neither ask nor make any kind of promise or commitment, so the predict dialogue acts category of most probably inform is appropriate.

"
2057,"This text contains a directive request, as the person asking to look the bill is not being granted permission to do so. The request is for the reader to grant permission, indicating that they are asking the question of whether or not the request should be granted. 
However, this is also a very informational text. It provides the price of a specific product, so it is more of an informational question than a direct request.

"
2058,"the text asks a direct question about what the person should do to the wearer, indicating that it is a request for an action
wearing one is an informational statement that does nothing to help the request be fulfilled, so it should be classified under inform
question is the most likely dialogue tag for this statement because the question mark is used and the statement is requesting information

A:
According to your explanation, I think the answer is that question is more likely than inform.

"
2059,"In this example, 'it's because you're wearing a jacket that isn’t thick
enough' is an informative statement, providing information to the
recipient about a fact about you. The statement is therefore most
likely aninformative statement. 
  
However, if the statement was changed to 'your jacket is too thin'
the statement would become an interrogative one, seeking an
answer. As such, this is a good example of a conditional statement
which is classified under interrogatives.

"
2060,"In this example, wearing the scarf does help to keep one's body warm. The speaker has shared this information with you, and you have expressed your agreement or acceptance with this statement.

"
2061,"In this case, 'that's' is used as an adverb to provide additional information or clarification. It is not used to ask a follow-up question or to make an inquiry. Therefore, this is classified under inform. 
  
If the dialogue acts had been question and inform classified together, then the classification would have been incorrect.

"
2062,"Inform is used when the information being provided is not a request for confirmation or a directive to do something. Instead, inform is often used to describe a fact or information that is already known to the person being spoken to. For example, when someone says, ""I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were on your way out,"" they're using inform to inform the receiver of a previously unknown fact.

"
2063,"Inform is the default dialogue action in conversations. It indicates the
  speaker is sharing information or facts about something that happened

This is because in the last sentence, we don't know what the other person's preference is, so the inform dialogue is still the most likely one.

"
2064,"In this case, it is providing confirmation to someone that they have just received. This is a common way to provide confirmation, as it does so without requiring the confirmation of the addressee. 
For example, ""yes,"" ""you're right,"" or ""of course.""

"
2065,"the text gives instructions to try to prepare for the job
interview. 
it does this by providing advice or guidance, such as ""read up on job interviewing tips"" or ""take practice tests to practice for your interview"". 

 

In contrast, when a dialogue acts as information (inform, out ofinform questiondirectivecommissive), the message is typically to provide information to a recipient. For example, ""here is a list of things you should bring to your job Interview. Please read it and bring the appropriate items."" In this case, you would not consider the advice as a characteristic of a request for advice.

 
  

However, in this example the dialogue is also classified  as directive. This is because the  text gives specific instructions on how the reader should prepare. In contrast to advice, instructions are not information but rather a form of request. 
  

 
   

 
    

 
     

 
      

 
       

 
          

 
           

 
              

 
               

 
                  

 
                   

 
                        

 
                       

 
                     

 
                      

 
                    

 
                 

 
                

 
             

 
            

 
         

 
        

 

 
        
       
         
          
           
        


A:
According to this article, there are 4 types of Dialogue Acts: 

 
Out of Inform: This type of dialogue action is used when the speaker is providing general information.  For example: ""I'm going to take the red pill in 'The Matrix'"".  This type is often used in first person point of views.
 
Question:  The question type can occur when someone is asking for information from the listener.   For Example: I'm looking for a house. Can you recommend one?
 
	
Directive: A directive action occurs when one person is telling another what to do.     For instance: You are going too fast in a curve. Slow down. 
 
 commissives: Commissives are used to make promises or commitments.    For examples: We will start a new project in 3 months. I will buy you a car if you are accepted into med school.

"
2066,"Question: ""things"" are ""going well"" with the ""speaker""?
This text contains a direct question. The question is ""are things going Well with [the speaker]?"". Based on this question and the context, it seems like the question was asked by the person speaking. 
  
Overinform: the answer is yes, things are well.

"
2067,"In the given context, it is not clear whether the person the user is talking to is an expert in Chinese Tea. Based on their previous statement, they might be a beginner in this topic. In that case, asking them to explain their knowledge would be considered as over-asking. 
On the other hand, if the expert is the one the the system is trying to identify, then the answer could be that i have a problem understanding Chinese teas, in which case the dialogue acts of understand and i don’t understand would fit better.

"
2068,"Question dialogue acts are used when the information provided does require a decision or action from another person. For example, a salesperson might ask if a customer is interested in a particular product, but the customer does have the option to decline and end the conversation. In this case, it can reasonably be assumed that a request for action has taken place. 
  
Inform dialogue Acts are generally used to provide information or advice to another individual. They do not require an action to be taken, nor do they request one.

"
2069,"the text does not ask a direct question but rather seeks to elicit a personal evaluation from its addressee;
based on this, we predict that this is aninform dialogueact.

"
2070,"In this example, ""have you chose what you want to dress?"" is a yes or no question which is typically associated with a query dialogue. However, in this case, it is more of a statement which suggests the answer is no. In this context, you can see the use ""ain't"" which implies that ""you"" is not the correct person to answer this question as it seems to refer to something else.

"
2071,"Inform: This text shares information that is not directly related to guiding or directing the other person. It is simply sharing information. 
Question: Although the question is asked, it does not seek an immediate answer. The recipient is expected to consider the options provided. 
  Directive: In this example, this is a directive statement.  The text suggests an action or choice to make.

"
2072,"Directive dialogue acts are used when the other person's response is needed to carry out an activity that is being suggested. For example, if a person is suggesting that they go to a party, and the person does want to attend the party but does have some reservations, then the response ""I will call you when I get there"" is a directive response. If the same person then asks ""why do you have reservations?"", then it would be a commissIVE response to give the reason.

"
2073,"In the beginning of your message, you mentioned that you lost your bag, and then in the end of message you thanked the person for letting you watch TV. Based on this, it seems like you are trying to convince the other person to do something, but you haven't shared enough information to make a decision on what that something is. In this case, your predicted dialog act would be question.

"
2074,"Inform: This is because the given statement is about the capability of the listener to do a given task without any additional assistance, and does  not ask any question or request any instruction or promise.

"
2075,"Question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the
  text is likely asking someone a follow-up question. The question is
asked in the context of ""anything i could do?"" which suggests that
someone could help the asker with something. 
  Inform: inform is the correct dialogue action for this sentence, because it indicates someone is providing general information, rather than asking or commanding someone to do something

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue: A Sound Analysis"" by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, there are four basic types of dialogue acts: question/answer, command/request, order/direction, and comment.  The text you provided is most likely a comment, since it's not asking, commanding, ordering, nor providing any information: it simply is.

"
2076,"Directive dialogue acts are used to request or command someone to perform an action. They are not questions or statements, so they do not require an answer. Directive is the most common dialogueact, but commissives and questions can also be used. 
  
  The recipient of directive dialogue Acts is typically performing an act that is required of them, such as going to the store to buy milk. The recipient is often asked to do this by a person who is giving the directive. For example, a parent might ask their child, ""Do you want to go to Target or Walmart?"" If the child says ""Target,"" the parent may say, 'You want Target, don't you?' and if the answer is 'yes,' the action is performed. If instead the response is ""I don’t know,"" then the question of whether the person wants to act upon the request is not answered, because the act required is unknown. A commissIVE dialogue Act is used when two or more people are working together to accomplish a goal. In this case, one person is asking another to join them in their goal, for example ""John, will you help me carry the groceries?"".

"
2077,"This text is a request for a price for something. Based on this, it is classified commissively. 
In contrast, if the dialogue acts were classified informatively, this would be classified overinform, overquestion, outofdirective, undercommissive.

"
2078,"Question: the dialogue acts of the first two lines are overinform and question respectively, indicating that these lines seek more information than the recipient is able to provide. 
  
  Inform:  the dialogue Acts of lines 3 and 4 are inform and line 5 is informational, suggesting that lines 5 and 6 are providing information without seeking more.

"
2079,"In this example, ""the man"" and ""sea"" are mentioned, but the context does not provide enough information to determine whether they refer to a person, place, thing, etc. This makes the prediction of the dialogue acts difficult.

"
2080,"In the example provided, a price reduction was requested. However, this is only mentioned in the context of asking for a discount. Since the request is made in a directive manner, and the discount is a request for information, then the dialogueact is classified here as a direct request.

"
2081,"This text indicates a lack of trust in the customer's ability to find a better price elsewhere. 
  The customer is being asked to confirm that this price is indeed the ""best"" price, and the shop is assuming that they will comply.

"
2082,"the text asks for the bill of a person, indicating that this person is an agent of someone and the message is directing them to do something
it is free, providing additional information that makes this act more directive than inform

A:
According to your explanation, I think the following is the reason why the prediction is ""question"":
""it’s free"" is providing more information than ""it costs $X"".
In your second example, ""free"" provides more detailed information (it doesn't cost $x) than in the first example.

"
2083,"This text indicates the need for a response. The speaker does not provide enough information to understand what they are asking, so the response provides more detail. 
It is a request for advice or guidance. As the first person in the conversation, it is the responsibility of the listener to provide guidance and advice. 
  

A:
According to this article, you can use the predict_dialogue_act function from the nltk library to get the dialogue acts of a text.  The following is an example of how to use it: 

 
from nLTK import *
text = ""I want to buy a house. I'm looking at several different options. What should I look for?""
print ""The text was: %s"" % text
# The dialogue Acts of text are: question question directive question commissIVE
answer = predict(lambda x: x in (""question"", ""question directive"",
                                 ""directive"", 
                                    "" commissivedir"",  ""question commissives"" ), text)
if answer: print ""the text contains the following dialogue Act:"", answer[0]
else:  print text

"
2084,"Overinform: the dialogue acts of the two sentences are both overinform, as the first sentence provides a lot of information that is unnecessary for KARA to understand who Mike is. 
  
Question: although the second sentence is asking for money, there's no question word in it, so it is considered as a non-question sentence. 
Directive: since the sentence requests KARAA to give Mike fourhundred yuán, and the verb is in present tense, thus it can be considered a direct command.  
 
Committive : the other three sentences in this paragraph are all commissives, since they are asking questions, making promises or commitments, etc.

"
2085,"'that’s basically is' is a concluding statement that provides a summary of what was previously discussed. 
It is therefore classified here as a ‘directive’ dialogueact.

"
2086,"the text provides helpful information to the listener about what to expect and what is expected of them;
this text does NOT ask any questions, make any commands, nor does it make commitments. Therefore, it is an informative text.

"
2087,"Directive is a dialogueact that indicates a request or order. The person asking for a ""tour of house"" is requesting that a person be present to provide information. 
  

We ’re glad you’re here, would  you like to see the inside of our house?
No, I ’m fine, thank you. I’m just here for the day.

"
2088,"In this example, it is not clear whether the person asking for a tea cup first is requesting a drink of water first or is simply confused. In either case, providing the information that you would like to drink first would be a request for information, not a command. 
  
However, if the request is for water, then it would make sense for it to be followed by a ""cup of Tea"" as a way of requesting the drink to take place. This is because tea is a beverage that is typically served with or in a teacup.

"
2089,"In this example, ""why don't you sit on a sofa?"" is an invitation to a person to sit down. Based on this context, it seems like the ""don't"" is meant to discourage the invitee from refusing the invitation.

"
2090," commissives are used to express strong opinions or commands, so in this case, it seems like the person is strongly discouraging the buyer from buying the weed, by saying 'no thanks'.
overinform and overquestion indicate that a commissivedata is incorrect or incomplete. In this example, since the response is not a direct command, but rather a polite refusal, overinform is unlikely to apply. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think the following dialogue acts can apply to this situation: 
inform:  outofinform, inform
question: question
directive: directive
commissive : commissIVE
I think it's inform because the message is about apology and the sender is trying to avoid the mistake in future, not asking for any action from the receiver.

"
2091,"In this case, it has not been determined whether the question is being asked by the receiver or thesender. However, since the answer is optional, and the message is intended to be shared, then it would be considered a request for the addressee to provide their answer. 
If the response is provided, this would classify the act as a confirmation, as it provides the information that several types of tea exist.

"
2092,"In this example, we can see that Mike is being told what to prepare for dinner. The speaker has not asked a direct question or given a command, so the directive dialogue acts are the only ones that can apply.

"
2093,"the text does ask for information, as it asks the receiver's opinion about a certain aspect of their living space. 
it is also a request for the opinion of another person, and therefore it is considered a query. 
  
However, it does also express gratitude, anticipation, for future events, so it can also be considered an informational statement.

"
2094,"Question: ""they look Ancient""
Overinform: the table and mantelshelf are new, and not at all ancient
Q: Did you find them in a garage sale
D: No, I bought them new

In summary, based on this example, we can see that there is a lack in the provided information to make an informed decision on whether to direct the action of calling the Lost and Found office, ask for clarification, provide additional information or commit to the purchase.

"
2095,"Inform is used when someone is providing general information to another person. For example, a person might inform another that it is going to rain, but not provide any specific locations or dates that are likely to experience rain. 
  
Question is the most likely dialogue acts for the following text: ""can you help me?"" ""are you going out?"" or ""do you have a minute?"" 
   
These texts are asking for assistance, and question is an appropriate dialogue action.

"
2096,"Question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the
  sentence is likely a request for clarification. The use of ""sir"" in the 
  question is also a clue that it's a direct question -- ""please wait"" is 
   not a typical response to a statement of fact.

"
2097,"Inform is a non-question dialogueact, as it is not seeking information from the other person. 
Question is another non dialogue-act. It is used to express doubt or uncertainty. 
  Directive is an instruction dialogue action.  
Commissive  is a commitment dialogueaction.

"
2098,"Directives are used when the information being provided is so important that it overrides the need to provide information in a more general way. In this case, it is important for this person to tell the listener about all the food that they eat, because they are about to vomit. Therefore, this is a direct order to share all of their food habits. 
  
In contrast, when someone is simply providing general information, they do not need a command. Instead, people tend to use the general form of a statement when they want to convey information without committing to a specific opinion or position. So, in contrast to the above example, telling someone that one could help the other with chopping vegetables is more of an informational statement than a mandate.

"
2099,"This text includes the word 'careful' in the sentence 'it ’s still rather hot'. This suggests the author is expecting the recipient to make an effort to be cautious when drinking the tea, similar to how one would be cautioned when cooking with hot items. 
  
In addition, this sentence includes a command structure, 'be careful', which is a characteristic of commands. The word order in this structure is also important, with 'you' being the subject and the rest of that sentence being a direct command. Finally, there is the use of 'your' to refer to 'the speaker', similar in function to a personal pronoun. Together, these characteristics indicate that this is likely a commissIVE dialogue.

"
2100,"In this example, ""mylease endsnext month,"" the first part of the sentence, describing the end of a lease, is information. This is because it does NOT ask any questions, provide any commands, make any promises or commitments, and is therefore classified here as ""overinform.""
However, when the lease expires, it becomes a directive dialogueact, as it asks a direct question: ""so then, why do you have next to no time to move?"" This question is also classified in this section as being ""nonsmoker."" The answer to this question provides the reason why the leasing company has so little time left to prepare for the move: because the tenant will be moving out.

"
2101,"In this example, ""it's"" refers to a bed. The speaker feels sorry that someone would prefer a different type of bed than the one they have. In other words, they're expressing empathy. 
""It's A Jungle Out There"" by Bob Marley and the Wailers is an example of an album that contains this type song.

"
2102,"In this example, ""places"" is a noun, so it is likely that this is being asked as a yes/no question: ""Do you have any good places to eat around here?"". 
  
If the question is about multiple choices, then the answer could be ""yes"" or ""no"" for each, indicating that there are multiple options being considered. In this case, it would be a choice question rather than a simple question or statement.

"
2103,"In this example, 'i guess' is an informal statement that provides a tentative answer to the question of whether anyone has an available room/apartment. This is considered to be an inform statement because it does provide information, but does so tentatively.

"
2104,"Mike is expressing his dissatisfaction with the current room and is asking K. to find a new one for him. 
This is a request for K to perform a service, which is typically a commissIVE dialogue.

"
2105,"""how"" is a questioning word, and it is used to seek information and clarification. 
over is another way to ask a yes/no question. 
  question is the expected dialogue tag for this type of question

How much does the house cost? 
 - over how much are the rooms?

"
2106,"In this case, 1 000 Yuan is a large amount of money, so the inform dialogue acts are likely to be used. The inform act can be applied to statements that share information, such as facts or figures. In this example, “you are right, we can travel for about 2 hours at speeds of 80 km/h” is an example of an inform statement.

"
2107,"'nondrinking. is' is an adjective describing the person, and it is used as a noun in this context. The adjectival form of 'non-smoking' describes the state of being non- smoking. Therefore, 'is' can also be considered a verb. 
In this sentence, it's not clear whether the 'queen- size' bed refers to the bed size or to a preference. If it refers the to preference, then the sentence is not a request for information, because the request is for a 'king-sized' preference and not for any specific bed type.

"
2108,"'it does matter' is an over prediction. The prediction is not wrong, however, it is too specific and does make the model predict a different dialogue action than the actual one. 
'the bus routes are convenient' does provide some guidance, so it's close. However, this is a general statement and doesn’t provide any information that would make it aninform.

"
2109,"""yes"" is an affirmative statement, so the statement can also be classified under directive. 
the text does not provide any information, but rather shares information. Therefore, it can't be categorized as either question or command. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, I think the dialogue acts of your text are question and directive: 

 

Yes, We Have One Copy Left.  The Text Provides Information About the Availability of An Item, Indicating That There Is Only One Copie Left, Which Is Informative.

"
2110,"In this example, ""how did I do"" is an informational statement, not a dialogue. It does not contain any request for a response. Therefore, inform is the correct classification.

"
2111,"Directive dialogue acts are used to give orders or requests. The
  predicted dialogue action for this example is commissIVE (request,
request).

"
2112,"Question: This text is asking for information from another person, typically a recipient. This is characteristic for a  question. 
Overinform:  This text does not provide enough information to understand what is being requested. The request is for ""your hands"", but the context does  not provide any further details. 
  Question : ""Your hands"" is an instruction, but what exactly is the instruction? 
   Question  : ""I want  you to  put your  hands behind  your head!"" is  a request for an  evaluation, i.e. a comment on how bad something is. However, this is only a request, not an order.  
  Directive:   This is another characteristic that this  text can  be characterized  as a command. ""You are  under arrest!"" can only be interpreted as an imperative statement, meaning ""Do it!"".

"
2113,"Landlords often put notices up to lure students into their apartment. The notice in this example is clearly an attempt to get students to rent the apartment, so it is an informative message. 
  
However, this notice does nothing to increase the rent, and instead simply informs the potential tenant of a fact. Therefore, based on this message, a dialogue action of question is predicted.

"
2114," commissives are used when a speaker wants to make sure that an action is carried out, and the other party should not question the action

In this case, it appears that ""we're trying to incorporate more wind energy into our energy mix"" is being requested, so the response should include a directive (i.e., ""it will be done"").

"
2115,"the text ""it’s free"" provides  information about  something being
  available at  no cost
""i’m free"". What’ what does this mean? It means that the person
speaking is available without any cost to the other person. 
  The text does  not ask  a question  give a  command or  make a
promise.  Therefore,  it  aligns  with the  characteristics of  an inform
dialogue act

"
2116,"Question dialogue acts are used to request information or clarification from the other party. In this case, it seems like the person asking for a room might be confused about what they are looking at. 
Overinform dialogueacts are similar to question dialogue Acts, but they provide too much information. The person requesting a hotel room is probably just looking for an accurate price, and they don’t need to know that this hotel is famous for its nightclub. 
  
Directive dialogueact is used when one wants to carry out an action or perform some task. Based on this, we can see that in this example, this person is looking to book a specific type of room, so a direct dialogue action is appropriate.

"
2117,"the text offers a suggestion or recommendation for the flowers that I want to be delivered. 
it implies the florist will deliver the requested flowers for a fee.

"
2118,"Question: ""who"" is the subject of ""they""? This is an interrogative sentence, and the word ""whom"" indicates a direct object. In this case, ""them"" refers to the person or people being questioned. 
  
Overinform: the sentence provides too much information by providing the details of each person. The sentence does provide some information though, by stating that there are six of them for every room. This indicates there is some sharing of details between the people, but it does little to provide an overview of who they are for. 
Questions: who are ""you"" and ""your""? These are interrogatives, asking for information on a person's identity. Without providing any additional context, it's difficult to determine what ""we"" are being asked about.  The sentence also does ask for more information than is provided, as ""six of"" implies there could be more than six. Additionally, there's no indication of what the ""something"" might be.

"
2119,"Inform is used when the message is simply conveying information. 
  
Question is when a message contains a request for information, and the sender is looking for an answer.  This is the most common type of dialogue acts. 
Directive is for messages that contain a command, order, or request. Commands are used for giving orders, directions are for telling someone where to go or what to DO, promises are to make a promise, etc. Commissive acts are often used in negotiations or when one person is making an offer to another.

"
2120,"the text does ask for specific information (what flowers?)
it is a request for confirmation, rather than a statement of fact (i.e. ""do i have this book?"" vs ""this book exists and you do not have it"").

In summary, based on this example, we can predict that 
ernst hewingway's 'the man & the Sea' is classified into the question dialogue acts.

"
2121,"There is an error in this passage: the flowers are never mentioned again. The speaker simply recommends something based on their knowledge of your interests. This is not an example of giving information or asking questions, but rather of issuing a direct order.

"
2122,"the text asks for a reason for sending flowers, indicating that it's a personal gift and the sender is expressing their feelings towards the receiver
flowers are a common gift for birthdays, valentines day, and other special occasions, so the question of why flowers are being sent is reasonable and indicates the message is being delivered in a more personal way

text:  'ok, here is the reasoning for your flowers. i noticed you have been having a rough time recently. so i wanted to send you these flowers as a sign of my support and friendship.'

"
2123,"In the beginning of the message, there is no indication that this is a birthday message. The speaker may have just mentioned this topic because they were curious about the effects of different types of flowers on people. 
Later in the same message the birthday of today's the topic is mentioned again, so it is likely that today actually is her actual birthday.

"
2124,"In the example provided, ""she"" is the subject of conversation, and the ""plan"" or ""intended presence"" at that location is something the listener should know about. This is therefore a ""question"" because it asks for information, specifically, what the other person likes.

"
2125,"""i can’t remember"" is an example of an underinformative response. The response does not provide enough information to understand the meaning of the statement. In this case, ""i don’ t remember,"" is not enough to explain that you cannot remember the information provided. You should have provided a reason for your inability to remember. For example, you could have said, “I’m in a rush rightnow, so I’ll have to defer to my notes.”

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible responses for a text to be classified under the question dialogue tag: 
1. Question: This text asks a direct question
2. Answer:  This text answers a previous question or provides a clarification
3. Request:   This is more of  a request for clarification than an actual question  or
4. Information:This  text provides  information but is neither a  question nor an  answer

"
2126,"Inform: the dialogue acts are sharing only information, and there is no commitment or request for action. 
Question: there are no commands or requests for actions in the given text. 
  Directive: this is a request or command for a specific action, such as giving the wife a rose.  
Commissive : this dialogue is asking for feedback or opinions, but there isn't any commitment to action from either party.

"
2127,"Inform is a prediction that is made based on a combination of the words and punctuations in the input text. In this example, based off the provided text the dialogueact is inform because of how the word'may' is used in conjunction with 'i have' and 'the invoice'.

Question: is similar to inform in that it also makes an inference based upon the combination and arrangement of words in a sentence. However, it is different in how it predicts the next action in response to a given input. Question is also a binary classification, where the response is either a 'yes' or a  'no'. In contrast, a dialogue answer can range from a simple 'inform' to more complex answers such as'request', 'order', or 'commissive'. 
  
Directive:  is a classification based solely on words used. Directive is binary, and the only required input is another dialogue response. The classification is based purely on whether the given words are used as words to direct or order someone. 
 Commissives: are a little more complicated. Commisitive is very similar in nature to question. It is however a bit more nuanced in its prediction.  It requires the presence of a commissIVE word (such as want, need, etc.) in order to predict the answer.

"
2128,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask questions, such as ""What color is the sky?"". In this example, ""what colour is"" is considered a query, whereas ""the color of the"" and ""is the color"" are considered directives. 
Inform dialogue Acts are typically used for sharing information, opinions, and responses to questions. ""The sky is blue"" would be an example of a typical inform response. 
  

Note that the classification of dialogue Act is an approximation and is not meant to be 100% accurate. Dialogue Acts can overlap with other categories.

"
2129,"'i do,' in the preceding text is an example of what linguists call 'confirmation'. It is a form of information that confirms or verifies something that has already been said. Confirmation is not the same as confirmation, however. That word has other connotations that are not present in this example. 
  
In this context, 'do' is used to make an affirmative statement, and'red' would therefore be a better color than 'orange.' 


"
2130,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask someone a direct question. In this case, it's asking if the customer would like their order picked up. 
  
  The text does ask this question directly, and it does indicate that the answer will affect the customers' experience. However, this is more of a general question than a specific question about whether the order should be picked or delivered.

"
2131,"Directive is the most common dialogue acts category. When a character is telling someone else what to do, it is usually because they have the authority to make that decision, are being asked to take a specific action, have a legal obligation to follow a rule, their actions are required by the plot, they need to protect themselves or their loved ones, there is no other choice for them to choose, etc. 
  
In this case, speaker (the person asking the question) is looking for advice or help from another person (receiver). This is because the receiver has just meet the sender for first, hence the need for a conversation to exchange information. In addition, since the conversation is about publicspeaking, a request for help is natural.

"
2132,"the text does ask for a response (address), so the classification of the act as a query is not correct
there is no indication that this is an interrogative text (e.g. a statement that can be interpreted as ""yes"" or ""no""), so it's over-classified as query
it does provide information, so we should classify it as inform

In summary, we predict that your text contains a request for information (i.e., the location of a book).

"
2133,"In this example, ""it is ten past six"" is an informative statement, not a request for information. The speaker wants to make sure the person they're talking to is aware of the time. 
""We're  late"" and ""dinner is  at six-thirty"" are questions, so the inform dialogue acts are over-predicted. 
  
However, if the statement had been ""we're ten minutes late"" or ""the dinner time is six fifteen"", then the predict dialogue  act would have been question.

"
2134,"Question dialogue acts are used to request information from the
  listener. In this case, it is requesting the doctor to provide more
information about what the patient should be doing. 
Overinform dialogue Acts are similar to question dialogue
activities, but the information being shared is too much. Here,
the doctor is oversharing information and should have used
inform or commissives instead. 
  
Directive dialogueacts are the most common type of dialogue activity.  In this example, 'doctor' is telling 'patient' what to do.

"
2135,"Chinese herbal medicines are typically not effective for treating diseases. The speaker instead recommends a different treatment method. 
  
Directives are often not well received by the people being spoken to, as they feel as though they are being told what to do without being given the opportunity to make a choice. In this case, it is likely that they would not try the Chinese herbal medication, since the recommendation is not to their liking.

"
2136,"Question: ""Mike! Good to Hear from You. How Are You?""
Inform: Sharing information, not a request for information. 
Directive: Mike! Please tell me how you are. 
  Commissive : Mike, please tell us how YOU are!

A:
(I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I'll post it anyways)
I've been working on a chatbot for a while now, and I've come across this problem of predicting the correct dialogue acts for my responses. I'm still not 100% sure about it, so I thought I'd share my current approach. Please note that this approach is still very much a work in progress, as I am still learning about this field. So please be kind. :)
First of all, I use the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit to do part of the work. This is because it has a very good core dialogue model, called the Coreference Resolution model. The Coref model is very accurate, especially for Chinese. However, it does have some limitations, such as not being able to handle some Chinese characters. Fortunately, CoreNLPS also provides a Chinese character recognition model for it to use. In my case, this model can recognize most Chinese words, although it's not perfect. But it can be improved by feeding it more training data. And it also has some advantages over the coreference resolution model: it doesn't require any external resources, like dictionaries, to train on. Also, since the model only needs to recognize Chinese, you can use it for other languages too. Finally, another advantage of using Corenlp is that it provides some useful features, including part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, named entity recognition, etc. These features can help me do some pre-processing, for example, removing stopwords, stemming words and so on, before feeding the preprocessed text to the machine learning model to predict the next dialogue action. Another advantage is it allows me to get some statistics about the input text. For example: how many characters does it have, how long is each sentence, what is its partof_speech, whether it contains Chinese or not, if it starts with a capital letter, all these can provide some clues to help the ML model predict better.

"
2137,"""actually"" is an adverb, so it is classified over inform as anadverb. 
unless there  is atraf jam is the conditional form of the verb to be, therefore itis classified out ofinform as conditional.

"
2138,"'i didn’t realize' is an example of a warning statement, where the warning is that something bad might happen if you do not take some action. Commissive statements are used to ask for or give orders, so this warning nature makes it a commissIVE statement

However, 'apologize' also means to say sorry, meaning that this is a combination of commissives and informants. Informants are only used when the other two dialogue acts are missing, therefore this can only be an informant.

"
2139,"Inform acts provide information without asking for or requiring a response. The information is provided to the listener so that they can make an appropriate response or take an action based on it. Inform is a common type of dialogue action, and it can often be used in place of a more specific type. For example, ""I'm going to be late for work. My car broke down on I-95. I'm afraid to call a tow truck because they might say I should have called earlier. But I need to get to work now, so I'll just walk."" In this example the information provided is sufficient to make the appropriate decision, even if the specific actions required are not mentioned. 
  
Question dialogue acts seek to elicit an answer to a direct question or request. They are commonly used when the answer is not immediately apparent or when a person is uncertain of the right answer. Question dialogue Acts include: question, interrogatively,  and directive.

"
2140,"Question is the most common dialogueact in English. It is used when someone is seeking information or clarification from another person. In this case, it appears that ""What do I need?"" is being asked by ""Doe Man!"". 
  
  Question can also be used in a request or order. For example, ""Would you please pass the salt?"". Here, we can see that Doe Man! is asking Doe for something to happen.

"
2141,"Inform is used when the information is needed to complete a task. In this case, it appears that a conversation is happening between two people, and the person who is receiving the message is not aware that they need certain information in order to understand what is being said. The person asking for the tea does not provide enough information to determine if they require the same type of teabag or the exact same amount of leaves. Without this information, they cannot determine whether or not they should take the initiative to look up the ingredients for these specific teaware. 
  
Question is  used when someone is seeking information. Here, there is enough context to discern that someone needs to know a specific fact inorder to make a decision. For example, if someone were to ask ""why is the sky blue?"", it would be considered a query. If someone asks ""how tall is adam?"", this would likely be regarded as a statement.

"
2142,"""What kind"" of class you would like is a general question that does  not require a response. However, if the question is asked of someone who is not present at the time, it may be inferred that they would prefer a specific class. In this case, a more specific dialogue action would be ""classes you might like"".

A:
According to the model, this is the answer to your question: ""What kinds of courses would one like?"".

"
2143,"the text asks a direct question: ""a driver’s course?"". The question is not about the driver, it is about whether a course is needed. This is an informational question. 
driver's courses are available, and the cost is reasonable. 
  

A:
According to this page, there are 4 possible answers for a ""question"" in Dialogue Act Vocabulary: 

 
Over: question
Question: direct inquiry
Directive: request for action
Commissive : request promise
Inform: informational statement
Request: ask for information
Advise: provide information

"
2144,"This text indicates the directive dialogue acts are preferred over the inform and question dialogue Acts. The first sentence indicates ""great!"" which is a strong affirmative statement. Then, it asks the question ""would you rather smoke or not?"" which indicates a directive conversation. Finally, ""so why"" is an inquisitive question which asks for an answer.

"
2145,"In this case, it is not clear whether the sender is asking for confirmation (inform) or making a suggestion (suggestion). The context does not provide enough information to determine which type of request is being made. 
  
If it was asking confirmation, then the answer would be that it would need an appt. Otherwise, if it were making suggestion, there would not be any need for an an.

"
2146,"In the example above, 'can i...?' is an example of a 'question' (which requires an answer) followed immediately by 'help you'. This is therefore a combination of 'directive' and 'commissions'.

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue: A Puzzle of Words"" by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, there are five basic types of dialogue acts: 
1. Commendatory: ""You did a good job.""
2. Affirmative:  ""I think you did an excellent job""
3. Command:   ""Come over here and do it.""  ""Do you have a pen?""
4. Informative  ""I'm sorry, I didn’t realize I had to do that.""  
5. Question: “Why did you do this?” “What do you want me to change?”

"
2147,"Directive is the most general type of dialogue acts. This type is used to express a request or order. 
  
  - The directive dialogueact is often used in a conversation to request a service or product from another person. For example, you might use a command to ask someone to pass you a piece of mail. In this example the command is more of an order than a dialogue. 
- In a business conversation, a person might ask another for a favor, such as providing information or recommending a product.

"
2148,"Question is the most general type of dialogue acts. It indicates a speaker who is either seeking information or is uncertain about something. In this example, it seems like the sender is unsure about when the receiver would like a visit to take place. 
  
  Inquisitive: the question is phrased in such a way that indicates the asker is curious about the answer. For example: ""how did you manage that?"" or ""I'm curious to know how you did that."" 
   
Directive:  the question indicates an ask that is meant to happen, such as ""come in"" or  ""come to my place.""

 commissives: these are the least general types of dialogues acts and are used when you want to express an order or request. The word commissIVE is an adjective that means ""requesting"" and the word directive is used to mean ""order or command."" In the example above, ""red roses"" is being asked for, so this is classified under commissivo.

"
2149,"Inform is used when the information is not committed to memory and the person is asked for it. 
Question is when someone is being asked to make an assumption or guess and provide a statement to support their guess. In this case, it is likely that ""yes"" is a guess or assumption and ""you did"" provides the statement that supports the guess that is made. 
  
Directive is what the speech act predicts for this situation. Based on this context, ""come in"" would be a directive action for the subject to take.

"
2150," commissives are often used when the information provided is not relevant to the question or command being addressed. For example, if a person is asked to turn off the lights, a commissIVE response would be to shut the door, not to explain that turning off lights is a complex process that requires the involvement of multiple people. 
  

A:
According to this page, ""The inform and question dialogue acts are mutually exclusive. If a speaker chooses to inform another person, that person will almost certainly also ask questions.""

"
2151,"Overinform: the model predicted that this was a request for information. However, in the actual conversation, it was just a statement of the facts. 
Question: there was no request or instruction given in this conversation. It was simply a conversation between two people sharing facts and opinions. 
  

A:
According to your explanation, you are right.  The model over-predicted that there would be a ""request for explanation"" in that conversation and that is why it has a dialogue label of question instead of another label.

"
2152,"Bradford & Sons is a well known British shoe company. The name of their store is based on their brand. ""How may I help"" is an invitation to speak to a representative of Bradford & sons, so the response should be to the representative. 
""How are YOU?"" is the question mark in the previous response. This is because ""you"" can be either singular or plural, therefore the ""are"" question is being posed to both the individual and themselves.

"
2153,"Directive is a dialogue acts that are used to express instructions to a person or entity. In this case, Ms. Jenkins is the person/entity that the directive is directed to. Therefore the given directive falls into the 'directive' category. 
Note: In some cases, a 'command' can also be considered as a type of directive. However, in this particular case the word 'tell' implies that Ms Jenkins will be the one who will tell the employee. So in that case a direct order would be 'Tell the HR director that you have received this message.'

"
2154,"Directives are instructions or suggestions that are meant to guide or influence the behavior of another person. They are used to communicate a person's wishes or commands to another individual.

A:
According to this article, ""question"" is the most common predicted label for a phone call.  ""Question"" corresponds with ""interrogative"" in the NLP world.

"
2155,"In the above text the phrase ""cani have"" is a modal verb, indicating that something is possible. Based on this, it is likely that developing a new roll will be possible at the location specified. Therefore, this is most likely a request for service, and the dialogue acts of request and service are similar. The service of developing the new film roll is something that Milford Insurance would be able to perform at their location.

"
2156,"Directive is an action-oriented dialogue acts. It is used to give instructions or guidance to another person. 
  
  In this example, Mr. Burton is giving instructions to the man who is examining his throat to do the following:
- Open your Mouth

Question is a dialogue Acts used when someone is trying to get information from another. 
In the example above, when the examiner asks the patient to say ""ah"", the question mark indicates a desire for more information.

"
2157," commissives are often used when someone is asking for something to stop (e.g. 'no, stop it!')
the text contains a request for information (i.e., a query), which would be classified under question
based on this, if we also consider the other factors, we can conclude that this is most likely a commissIVE

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue Acts"" by Robert Stalnaker, there are four possible outcomes of a conversation: 
1. A conversation is initiated by a speaker.  In this case, a pre-condition is that there is at least one other person present. If there isn't anyone else present, then the conversation doesn't happen. The initiating speaker has the prerogative to decide what to do with the situation, e. g. to ask a direct question or to give information. In this way, he is commissively directing the action of someone else. 
 2. Another person participates in the communication. Then the second person has a right to question the initiating person. He can ask him a directly question. Or he can give him information that is not part of his precondition. But he has to respect the right of that person to direct him. So he too is directed by the first person and is questioner and informer at the same time.  
3. Someone else is involved in a communication, either as a participant or as an observer. Here, too, someone can question that someone. And someone also can provide information to that other participant. That person can be questioned or informated by someone, even if he doesn’t participate in that communication himself. However, in contrast to case 2, this person doesn‘t have the option to directly ask someone or give someone information if that would conflict with that participant’s preconditions. Instead, that information has priority over his own preconditions. Thus, case 3 is classified in Stalternak’ book as Commissive.

 4. No one participates or observes in communication and there aren’ t any pre conditions.  In that case there’ s no one who can direct anyone. It’ ll be up to each participant to act in his or her own best interest. Therefore, it’ll be a free for all. People can do what they want. They can also be questioned or informed. These two outcomes are classified together in case 4 as Inform and question are no longer possible. Stallynack calls this outcome No pre condition. 

"
2158,"This is because, although the message is requesting information from the addressee, it also makes a clear request for a response. In addition, there is no indication that this is a test question or that there will be a correct answer. Therefore, based on this information alone, we can conclude that Ms. Jenkins will not be able to predict the correct dialogueact from this message.

"
2159,"Jimmy is a person mentioned in the previous paragraph. Based on this information, it is not clear whether Jimmy is alive or dead. Therefore, this is considered a query rather then an informational statement. 
  
  Jimmi is an American singer-songwriter. He is known for his songwriting and his distinctive voice. His songs have been featured in several movies and television shows. Jimmy has had several top-ten hits in his career. However, he has also been involved in legal troubles. In recent years, his health has declined. As of today, Jimmy remains alive.

"
2160,"In the beginning of the passage, we are provided with general information. Then, towards the end, more specific information is provided. Based on this, it is not possible to predict the dialogueact of a response.

"
2161,"Directive is a dialogueact that indicates the speakers are directing or asking someone to do something. 
In this case, Mrs. Williams is being asked to see Mr. Sandals, so the dialogue acts are directive and question.

"
2162,"Out ofinform: the receiver is not informed of the fact that several
  categories of tea exist. 
Question: is it true that multiple categories exist of teas?
Directive: please go upstairs and see for yourself. 
 Commissive : come with me, I will show you.

"
2163,"the text asks the receiver to give information, suggesting that this is a request for the information to provided to another person. 
it is also possible that Jimmy is not able to speak yet and the question is to find out if he is able or not to ask the family questions.

"
2164,"Question: Does he has a Temperature? 
Answer: He does not have any temperature. He is a healthy person

In this case, it can be inferred that he is enquiring about the health of the individual he was speaking to.

"
2165,"Mike is not asking Kira a direct question. He is providing her with information. 
He is also not giving a command or a request for a response. Rather, his statement is conveying information to her.

"
2166,"Question dialogue acts are used to probe, test, and confirm information. In this case, it is testing whether the person has received the item that was sent to them. 
In this context,'stay in' is a test question. If the answer is 'No', then the sender should send the correct item again.

"
2167,"Question: the dialogue acts of the sentence are question and inform
Information: there is no information in the above text that is being asked or provided. 
  The text simply shares information regarding the health condition of a person.

"
2168,"Directive is a special type of dialogueact that is used to ask someone to do something. In this case, it is being used as a request for the doctor to see the patient.

"
2169,"the text is asking someone for information, therefore it is a direct question
it is not providing any information and therefore the question is out of scope
there is no mention of a person or entity being asked to perform a task, so this is commissIVE

based on these factors, I predict that this will be a commissivo response.

"
2170,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask a direct question or to make an inquiry. In this case, although the question is framed as being posed to Mr. Green, we can see that it could also be posed as advice to another person. For example, if the following text was used:

'Mr.Green, I believe I have been charged double for this purchase. Could you check with your bank to confirm this?'
  
In this example the dialogue is still classified question but the context makes it more likely that this is a request for advice. 
  The text also uses the word 'look' which can also indicate a suggestion or a recommendation.

"
2171,"Question: ""How bad Did I Do?""
This text is requesting an assessment of the performance of someone. This is typically done with a statement of evaluation or a request for information. The word ""Did"" in the sentence indicates the question is being asked of another person, and the word performance is used to provide context. 
  
Overinform: This text provides too much information to the receiver. Inform is the correct classification for this dialogue action.

"
2172,"Inform: the dialogue acts of the given passage are over inform and question. Overinform indicates that a speaker was too verbose, providing too much information; whereas, Question indicates a lack of clarity in a statement or request. In this case, there is a request for me to continue to hold the job for a further year, and the request is unclear. 
  
Directive:  the dialogue Acts of  this passage  are  directive  (out  of  inform,  question,   direct ,commissive) .  In this passage, a  speaker is giving  a response  to a prior statement, in this  case, ""ok. that  shall be  arranged.""

"
2173,"""Irene"" did not mention that she was planning to leave her job as a Sales Manager. Therefore, it could be inferred that ""planning to"" and ""leaving"" are two separate events. 
  
  Based off of the context of her statement, we can assume that her current job is not satisfying her. She is looking for something new and exciting, and this new opportunity may be a better fit for her career path.

"
2174,"Inform is generally considered to have positive connotations, such as conveying information or facts, and is therefore preferred. However, inform can also be used to convey a lack of information, as in the example below. 
  
  Frankly speaking, I don't know much about this topic.

"
2175,"Inform is a dialogueact that is used to provide information to a listener. This text contains details about an upcoming event, but does so without directing the person to take any action. Therefore, inform is the most appropriate dialogueAct for this context.

"
2176,"'it's nice' can mean either 'it is nice in general' or 'this particular instance of it was nice'. The question marks in the above text indicate that someone is curious about how the visitor would characterize the quality of the meal. 
'the food was well-prepared' could mean 'the food preparation was good' (the commissitive act) or that 'there was something wrong with it' and the question is about what that might be (question). 

 

A:

I would say that ""it was very good"" is an example of an inform answer.  ""It was excellent"" or ""It rocked!"" are questions.

"
2177,"Directive is the most general type of dialogue acts. Directives are commands or orders that are given to someone to do something. Commands are orders given directly to a person to carry out a task. 
  
In this case, 'can youtell meabout theterrine?' seems like the person is giving a directive to another person, and the second person has to tell the first person aboutthe terrinedirectly. 
This is because the word 'tell' is used in the sentence, so the dialogueact of question is predicted.

"
2178,"""yes"" is an affirmative statement, and it indicates the author's agreement with the statement that has just been made. 
a terrINE is indeed a horrible sounding thing to eat, but the flavor is actually quite good; the affirmative nature of the response indicates agreement.

"
2179,"In this case, it appears that there is some information being shared between the two parties, but it does so indirectly. The speaker does ask the recipient to do something, and the request is for the receiver to take possession of an item on their behalf, however the information is being provided by the sender.

"
2180,"This text indicates the asker is directing or guiding the conversaton towards an outcome. This is typically characteristic for a directives dialogue acts. 
  
  The text ""that’s basically all"" is giving information, not a direct question or command. Therefore, it should be classified under the inform category.

"
2181,"the text uses the word ""help"" to indicate that a follow-up question is expected
""can i"" is an informal way of asking ""may I?""
asking ""you"" instead of the actual addressee, i.e. ""who are you?"" indicates a more casual conversation

A:
According to the book ""Text to Speech for Dummies"" by John Swets, there are four types of questions: question mark, exclamation mark (or ex), question and statement.  The text you provided is most likely a statement because it does not contain the words ""question"" or ""exclamation"" and it appears that ""somewhat?"" is the main topic of conversation.

"
2182,"""you can eat either frites or potatoes"" is an informative statement, providing the reader with information. 
On the contrary, ""you could have either friet or boiled potato"" would be a more directive statement.

"
2183,"Question: I'll Have the Potatoes. What Are You Having? This text is a request for information from another person, so the dialogue acts are classified here as a  question. 
  
Out of Inform: This is the first of two questions in this response. The second question is What Kind of Potato Do You Prefer? 
   
What Question? I’ll Have The Potatos.  What Are  You Having?: This question asks for a description of the meal, specifically the type of potatoes that will be served.

"
2184,"Directive is the only other category that includes commands or requests. Commands orrequests are typically used when someone is requesting something of another person, such as asking someone to do something for you. 
  In this case, KARA is being asked to have some of OULONG tea. OulONG is one of those teasts that Mike is not familiar with.

"
2185," commissives are often used when asking for something to be done or for another party to do something. For example, a parent might ask a child to clean their room, and a teacher might request a student to turn in a homework assignment. 
  
overinform,question,directive,commissive: These are the possible dialogue acts for this example.

"
2186,"Directive is the most general dialogueact. Directives are used to give orders to another person. In this example, a person giving an order to have orange juices is using the directive dialogueAct. 
Overinform is an over-specific form of directive. Over-informing is when someone gives too much information to a third party. The person in this case is overinformatively giving too many details about what the drink will contain. 
  
Question is another general type of dialogue Act. Questions are a way for one person to seek information from another. Here, someone is trying to find out information by asking another individual.

"
2187,"""those with Yogurt"" is a command, not a suggestion. 
the text does provide some suggestions, such as ""someone who is young and single"" or ""a traveler""

Would you Like Those With Yoghurt?

"
2188,"This is a good example of a text that has a commissIVE dialogue
  act.  The text contains information that is not strictly a
      request/request for advice, however, it is also not a directive
       nor a comment.   The information is more of  a request for
        clarification.

"
2189,"Inform is used in other examples in this document. Question is only used once, and directive is never used. Commissive is also only ever used as a single example in a longer passage. Based on this, we can conclude that inform and question are the only two possible choices for the dialogue act in our example.

"
2190,"Question: caterpiller fungus? What the hell is it? 
  Overinform: It is a fungus. 
   Questioning the information provided by the previous sentence, caterpliller is not a car. The fungus is the object being questioned. What is this fungus and where did it come from? This is where the question mark comes in. There is no definitive answer to this question as it is purely based on speculation. However, it does seem to be a type of fungus that grows on car tires.

"
2191,"This text provides information about a herb that is good to you. The inform dialogue acts are over-inform, because it also suggests that you should take the herb, overinform by suggesting that it is better than other herbs, ask questions about the efficacy of the herbs and commissively suggest that more information should be provided.

"
2192,"Directive is a directive dialogue acts, meaning that a speaker will take action, make a request, or make an order to their conversational partner. In this case, Mr Sandels is telling Amy that he needs the space for oolong teapot. 
  
Question is another directive act, where a conversative partner is asked a direct question but is not required to provide an immediate answer. Mr sandels asks Amy when she needs oultong Tea.

"
2193,"Question: I wonder what's great (or not) about this. 
Overinform: It's just a description of something. 
  Questioning: But what is great or not about that? 

 
In summary, this is a great text to help you understand the dialogue acts.

"
2194,"This text uses the word ""it"" to refer to a ""scrim."" This is an unusual usage of "" it,"" which could be a sign that this is not a native speaker's writing. 
In addition, this sentence contains a direct question (""what is scrum?"") and an indirect question with a conditional (""would you say scrums are useful?""). This type of question is often used by non-native speakers to make requests or clarify instructions.

"
2195,"Inform dialogue acts are used when sharing information or facts. In this case, it's sharing specific details about a hotel room cost. 
Overinform dialogue Acts are when a speaker gives too much information to their listener. The listener may not need or want all of the information provided. 
  
Question dialogueacts are often used to ask for information. However, in this example, there is no request for additional information, so a query dialogueact is not applicable.  
 
Directive dialogue actions are usually used for making requests or giving orders. Since the action of accepting an ounce of free cocaine is a request, a direct order dialogue action is applicable here. 
 
Commissive dialogues are typically used in situations where a person is asking for or offering help. Here, since the person offering assistance is apologizing for a lost bag, and the context is one of loss, this is classified under commissives.

"
2196,"Inform is a good dialogue-act classification for this message, as it conveys information from the sender to their listener about something the receiver should do. 
  
  The sender is expressing gratitude for their receiver's good health, suggesting a rest to improve their health and drinking more fluids to stay hydrated. This is information that can be acted upon by the thelistener.

"
2197,"Inform is used to confirm something that was previously said. In this case, yes, it seems like the sender is confirming that they have reached the person they were speaking to. 
Question is the most likely dialogueact in this example. The sender seems to be seeking confirmation from the receiver, and is therefore using the question form of the dialogue acts. However, there is not enough context in the passage to make a definitive classification.

"
2198,"Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive: This is because the given statement does express the opinion of the author, and is therefore classified here. 
  
Overinform: this is the opposite of what the model is predicting. 
Question: the statement doesn't express an opinion. Rather, it asks a direct question. This dialogue acts as a request for confirmation.  It is classified in this category because it does ask for a confirmation from the reader.   
Directive : the sentence is an order, a demand for action. Inform acts are used for requesting information, not giving orders.    
Commissive  :  this is similar to a suggestion, but it also conveys a sense that something is expected or required.

"
2199,"Inform is used when someone is providing information or facts. It is not used to express opinions or feelings. 
  
Question is the most common dialogueact used in conversation. When someone asks a direct question it is assumed that they are looking for an honest answer. If the question is indirect, it usually indicates a hidden meaning. For example, if someone says 'is it hot outside?' it could mean either 'yes' or 'no', but the answer is actually 'it is hot out here'. 
   
Directive is another common dialogical act used during conversation, and it indicates an order or instruction.

"
2200,"In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, because it provides information to the listener about a person’s physical state. Inform is also the least restrictive, allowing for the possibility of the other dialogue acts. Question, direct, command and promise are all more restrictive than inform and therefore more likely to be correct.

"
2201,"Inform is a predicted dialog act that indicates that the dialogue acts question or give direction or promise. However, in this case, there is no question being asked or direction being given. The only thing the speaker is stating is that they are flat-broke. 
Question is another predicteddialog act. Question is used to ask someone a direct question and is not used in the above example. 
  
Directive is also a prediction. Directive indicates the direction of the conversation and indicates a request for a response. In this example, however, no response is requested.  The only direction given is to buy something else, but there isn't anything to purchase. Therefore, this is an example of directive but not a directive with a requested response
Commissive, on its own, is the prediction of a dialogue action. Commissive can be used as a way to describe a person who is acting in a certain way. Here, because the person is flat broken, they're acting commissively. They're not acting like a boss or a leader, so commissives are acting.

"
2202,"This text contains information that the speaker would like to share with the hearer, namely the details of how the they have trashes their party outfits. 
It is a conversational style where the information is shared informally, without the need for a request or a directive.

"
2203,"Question: ""why"" indicates a desire for an explanation or an answer. In this case, it is asking why the person has dragged the participant into the discussion. 
  Overinform: the question "" why "" is overused and can be considered as a sign of impatience or rudeness. It is better to provide sufficient information before asking ""Why?"". 
Directive:  "" i’ve spent  a week  salary""  is a command or request for a response.  In this particular case the command is for ""you"" to explain yourself.   
Commissive : "" i believe  you have  charged me  twice for  the same  thing.""  This is a request or command for confirmation. Here the request is from "" you"" for verification that ""i have been charged  once for this.""

"
2204,"Question: the first line of text indicates that the caller is the same person who contacted the user. This is important context that is missing from the other dialogue acts. 
Overinform: this is information that could have been provided in other ways, such as by providing the name of a person or a resource that was referenced. 
  Question, Overinform, Directive, Commissive: ""you're a liar"" is accusatory and does not provide the context of who is calling the ""user"". 
   Question (based on text): ""your caller ID said it was you calling. remember?"" 
     Question : the call is relevant to the conversation and provides important information to understand.  

Are you the real person? 
 The dialogueact of  this text  has beenclassified asquestion (directive, commissIVE). 
 Please explain reason:  The text ""are  you the  real person?"" is asking the question ""is this person"" (the caller) ""the real you?"".   
This is because ""real you"" can be interpreted as a personal pronoun, and in this context, it could be inferred that ""this person"", the actual caller, is impersonating the called party.

"
2205,"Directive is a dialogue acts that is used when the main purpose of communication is to give orders or make requests. In this case, ""let's look"" is an order, so it would be commissitive. However, in the second part of that sentence, Tonia says ""have a look"", which indicates she is consentient and so directive is the correct classification. 
  

A:
According to the Cambridge Dictionary, there are four types of dialogue: question/answer, order/request, request/confirmation, command. 
In this example, I think the answer is order. ""Let's have look..."" sounds like a request, but it's actually an answer to ""how do you know?"".

"
2206,"Inform: the information was given to the employee, and the reason for the dismissal is confidential. 
Question: I would like to know the reasoning behind the decision. 
  Directive: You should follow the instructions of your superior.  
Commissive : I am disappointed that this candidate was not selected for this position.

"
2207," commissives are often used when someone is giving orders or instructions to another person. In this case, it is likely that another candidate was mentioned in the conversation and the candidate mentioned has greater experience. The candidate with greater experiences is more likely to receive the job. 
  
overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are not applicable in this context. question is the only applicable dialogueact. overquestion: there is no directive or commissIVE in that context

A:
According to your explanation, you are right.  The text is just sharing the information that ""my plan is to go there April 14 to 17"".  It is neither a query, a request, nor a directive.

"
2208,"In this case, capability (more valuable) is the correct prediction. The capability of the speaker (the recipient) to understand English effectively is what is being questioned. In addition, this capability can be measured and verified, whereas information such as the time it will take to travel is not something that can easily be verified or measured. Therefore, information is less valuable (less valuable information) than the capability to effectively communicate inEnglish.

"
2209,"Yes, I think you can prove it to be more likely by providing me with a logical argument.

"
2210,"the text indicates the need for confirmation or opinion from recipient, and therefore the dialogue act should be a request for opinion (request)
there is nothing to confirm or ask for in this statement. it's just a fact that person A is unable to deal at that moment with distracting situation, so person B expresses his gratitude and wishes person C good night.

"
2211," commissives are used to express strong opinions or commands, such as orders or directives. In this case, it is likely that 'you' is the commissiver, since the question is addressed to another person (the'recipient').
question is used in order to seek information, so the answer to the previous question would be 'yes, I'm fine', which would make the first question redundant.

"
2212,"In the first sentence, ""is there"" is a yes/no question that is overinformative. The answer is no, there is not abarber nearby. 
""near here"" could be a location, but there's no context in the sentence to determine where ""here"" refers. 
  

text: isthere a  barbershop near you? 

 

based on this, it is considered a direct question

"
2213,"Over-prediction: the model predicted inform as the next dialogue acts instead of question or directive. 
Under- prediction: there is a third crossing of the road, so the closest outlet is not at this cross.

"
2214,"In this example, i'm assuming that the person asking the question is a local resident and is asking for directions to a nearby location. Based on this assumption, it seems like the asker is expecting a certain level of local knowledge from the responder, and the response provided does not seem to meet this expectation. 
  
  The text provided is not specific enough, as it does mention a location but does so in the form of a general address. This makes the request for specific directions more difficult to fulfill. Additionally, there is no mention of any special considerations for the direction-giver, such as whether they are familiar with the area or have any local friends. Without this information, a naive direction giver may provide inaccurate or misleading directions.

"
2215,"In the given context, it seems like the person is just giving information, not asking for it. So the classification of the dialogueact as question is not justified. 
On the contrary, if we look at the surrounding text (just above), the first person to ask the question was the second person. The first speaker was giving a piece of information to the receiver. Therefore, in this context the inform classification is justified, since the information was not asked for.

"
2216,"the text does express gratitude or appreciation, but it does so in the form of an action, not a feeling (i.e., ""thankyou verymuch"")
it does ask questions, gives commands, and makes promises or commitments, therefore it should be classified in question or commissIVE
based on context, there is no indication that this is a request for information, rather it seems like the person is expressing gratitude for something that happened to them.

"
2217,"Out of Commissive, Out of question: Unfortunately, based on our
  regulations, I have no choice but to confiscon these notes as they are
   counterfeit. 
In CommissIVE, In question : I am sorry, Mr. Sandals, these are not
    real dollars. Are you sure you want to continue?

A:
According to the GPT-2 model, ""Thank you"" is a Commissative Dialogue Act.

"
2218,"""over"" indicates a higher score than the other classes. 
the other four classes are the possible dialogue acts for the given text. 
  
Question: Can I have a better explanation? 

 

Information: This 500-ribs meat is not very tasty. It is very similar to the 500 chicken breast I had yesterday.

 
  
 
Directive: You can have as many tries as you want. I would like to share my approach of eating only chicken, fruits and vegetables.

  

"
2219,"This text indicates the need for a decision from another person, and therefore it falls under the directive dialogue acts. 
However, this directive is not clear. The person could mean that if the listener agrees to the course-of-action, then the note will be considered valid and the owner will receive the money. However, there is no indication of what the decision is.

"
2220,"In the above text the word 'ribs' is a proper noun, referring to the ribs of a pig. This is an example of an indirect discourse referent. Indirect discourse refers to words or phrases that refer to something but are not part of the direct speech of someone who is the author of that text. In this case, 'the ribs' are the indirect referential words. 
  
Directives are words and phrases used to tell someone what to do or to make it clear what should be done. Directives can be used in three different ways:
1. To tell the listener what someone said, e.g. ""John, please pass the salt.""
2.  To tell a listener to perform an action, for example, ""Please pass me the Salt."" 
3. As a way to ask for clarification, to get someone to explain something,  e.., ""Why do you always wear that hat?""

Indirect directives are used when the referentially bound noun phrase is ambiguous, such as when a word or phrase can refer either to a person or a thing. For example: ""I want to go to New York, are you coming with us?"" or ""The ribs are ready, let's eat!"" Indirection is used with proper names, proper adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, interjections, etc. to refer not to an object but to someone or something.


A directive is different from a commissIVE. A commissitive is any word that can mean 'to commit', 'be obliged to', or'require'. For instance, a Commissive can appear in a sentence like this: John, I want you to pass that paper to me. Whereas a directive is only used as a verb, like the example above, where the directive appears in the sentence: I would like you pass this paper. Commissives and directives can also appear as nouns, as in this example from the passage: the paper John is passing to his friend. However, directives cannot appear with Commissitives, because Commissatives can take an directive as an argument. So, in that example the verb 'pass' would be a commissive, not a directional verb. 


Another way of looking at this is that directives and commissives both can act as verbs, however, they are acting differently. Commissives take a direction as their verb argument, whereas directives take the action of telling someone something as the argument of their action verb

  

"
2221,"Directive is an act that conveys a message to another person or entity. In this case, a person giving back a pass book and a receipt. It is telling the other person to do something. 
Question is another type of dialogue acts that is used to seek information from another. Here, there is no clear message being conveyed. 
  The text simply asks a simple question about whether the returned items are in good condition.  
Overinform, inform and question are the three other types of dialogues acts. These are used in a conversation to convey different levels of information to the receiver.

"
2222,"the text asks a direct question: ""what will it cost you?""

This makes sense because the question is about the cost of something, and the response is a request to make an immediate payment. 
  
However, this is not the only reason. The following text also indicates the directionality of the conversation:
""sure johnd sandles. how much?"" 
      ""$100""
      ""...$150"" 
     ""that's too much""

"
2223,"the text indicates the speakers desire to continue the conversation, so the directive act makes sense. 
without revealing which dialogueact this is, it is overinform, and the question makes no sense, since the request is for the deposit to not be filled, not for any reason.

"
2224,"In this example, 'time to' is an instruction or command. The recipient is expected to respond immediately. Therefore, inform is the correct classification. 
  
However, if the response is delayed, then the question mark will be raised. In this case, it's likely that 'how did' has a different meaning, and is therefore classified in the other branch of the tree (question).

"
2225,"Question: the dialogue acts are question and directive. Question is used to seek information from another person, while directive is to give orders or instructions. In this case, Mr Sandal is giving an order to Michelle to let him have the use of the space for another 3 day period.

"
2226,"Inform is the most general dialogueact, and indicates sharing information without asking a clarifying question. In this case, there was information in that traffic could jam up the roads and cause the driver to be late. The driver was not seeking clarification or confirmation, but simply wanted to know the facts. Therefore, inform was the correct classification.

"
2227,"Inform is a prediction that is based on a combination of context and the nature of what is being discussed. In this case, it is likely that inform is the most appropriate dialogueact because it describes the general tone of a conversation between friends. The context includes the fact that this is an email from a friend, so inform would be expected. Furthermore, this email is about a party that was hosted by the friend and includes a recipe for a dish that both the host and guest can prepare. This suggests the conversation is one of friends sharing a meal together, a common occurrence. 
  
Out ofinform,question,directive,commissive: Based on context, inform does not appear to be the appropriate classification for this dialogue. It is possible that question or directive might be a better fit, but inform still seems like a reasonable classification.

"
2228,"This text is requesting information from the listener. ""the tree"" is a topic that is not directly relevant to the current conversation, so the question is being asked to find out what the ""good atmosphere"" would be like if the conversation were about another topic. 
  
  The text also contains the word ""free"" which can indicate that this person wants to be available to talk, but is uncertain of what that would entail.

"
2229,"""but"" is used to express a counterpoint or an alternative, so the use of ""but,"" in this context, is to emphasize the positive feelings the author has towards the decorations. 
  
  In addition, ""I'd hate"" implies a strong negative sentiment, whereas the response ""i'd really love to"" suggests that the sentiment is more neutral.

"
2230,"""that’s verykind ofyou."" is an example of expressing gratitude or appreciation. This is not a request for clarification, therefore it is classified under inform. 
“thank you.” is another example expressing appreciation or gratitude. 
  This is also not classified in question or directive or commissIVE.

"
2231,"This text indicates the opposite of the expected behavior, in that it indicates a command or order. Commands or orders are commissives, and they are not expected in informational exchanges. 
  
  The text: ""it seems sucha shame"" indicates an attempt to persuade or convince the listener to do something. Inform, ask a questions, give directions, are expected when attempting to influence or persuade others.

"
2232,"This text indicates the need for feedback or information, so it can be classified here. The author is looking for a response from their listener, indicating that the driving exam was a success or not. 
  
  This is a request for confirmation, therefore it falls under the question label.

"
2233,"In this case, ""but it remind[s] me"" of ""the great Christmas we had"". The latter is an adjective describing a past event, so it would be over-informative to include it in a reply. However, since the event is also described as ""good"", the reply is classified instead as informational.

"
2234,"In this context, ""it won’t always thisgood"" indicates a certainty, so the question mark is dropped and we are told that this is always the case. 
""we can’'t make this lastlonger thanit should"" suggests a time limit, and so this sentence is classified a command.

"
2235,"Directive dialogue acts are used to request or order someone to perform an action. They are often used in business or legal contexts to ask someone else to do something. For example, ""Please pass the salt"" or ""Stop the car at the red light"" are examples of directives. 
  
Question dialogue Acts are typically used when someone is seeking information. The question mark indicates that someone might have a different perspective or interpretation of the situation, and they are seeking clarification. ""What are the rules for x?"" or  ""What is the meaning of life?"" are good examples. In these cases, it is important to understand the perspective of another person in order to respond appropriately.

"
2236,"In this example, 'we'll leave [it up to Sunday] up till church' is a directive statement, because it indicates a time period (sunday) and a goal (to take down the flag after the service). The 'deal' that i'll offer is that we'll make the decision together, so that it's clear who is making the final decision.

"
2237,"In this example, ""question"" is the most likely dialogueact, because the question marks in the beginning of the sentence are asking a series of questions, such as ""how may I help"", ""you today"", and so on. The ""inform"" and the ""directive"" are also possible, but less likely, since they are not used in this context. ""Question"" also includes the word ""why"", which may be a reason why some people think it could be classified under question as well.

"
2238,"the text asks for something (a pizza), which implies that the speaker wants something from thelistener, and
it is asking questions, such as ""i can’t remember"" and ""it hasa maximumspeed of 200km/h"".

A:
According to your text the following dialogue acts are possible: 
out: no problem, could I have the name of the customer?
question: could you please give me the customers name? 

 
In your example the first sentence is an out of context dialogue, so I will focus on your second and third sentences.  The second sentence could be a direct question: ""Could you give the names of customers?"".  However, it could also be an indirect question by using the question word ""could"": ""Would you mind giving me customers names?"" This is because ""mind"" can also mean ""want"", so the sentence can be interpreted as a wish or a demand. In this case the answer to the indirect ""question"" would be ""yes"", because customers are the ones who want to give their names. So the second dialogue is: out: No problem; question; yes. 
 
Your third sentence contains the word 'it', which can indicate a referent. ""It"" could refer to an actual object, like a car, a person, an animal, etc. Or it can refer a abstract concept, as in ""That is not possible"". In your case, ""that"" is probably referring to a specific car. Therefore, your third dialogue could look like this: out; question; direct answer; car it.

"
2239,"Out of question: the pizza is on special today, but not for long. 
Question: why are our pizza specials on today? 

 

Inform: today our  pizza are special for two dollars off. 


 
  

Directive: buy some pizza.



 
   
 Commissive : I will buy a pizza after work.

 


"
2240,"Inform is used when the message is providing information. 
  Question is when a message contains a direct request for information, but does so in a way that allows for the asker to clarify or provide context before answering. 
Directive is for requests that are not open to negotiation or are outside of an individual's control. Commands are used to give orders or instructions. And Commissive describes a type of response that can only be used in situations where you are legally obligated to do so.

"
2241,"In the first line, 'tea is second in popularity after' water is used to introduce a factual statement. The second line is a request for information, and the rest of the line does nothing to support this request. 
'i’ll be happy to get you a cup of tea if that’s ok.' This line suggests a willingness on behalf of one person to make another person a drink of some kind. 
  This is an example of commissives, where the person offering the drink is also asking for it. In this case, it’d be ok to accept the offer.

"
2242,"Out ofinform: the writer is expressing frustration that he could not provide the requested information. 
Question: is there a right answer to this question?
Directive: this is an order, so the reader should do as they're told. 
 Commissive : the author is threatening the listener with punishment if they do not comply with their request.

"
2243,"Question dialogue acts are characterized by seeking information from the listener or asking clarifying questions. The example text does not indicate that a clarifiation is needed, so it can be classified here as a Question dialogue Act. 
  
Overinform dialogue Acts are used when the information provided is not needed. In this case, it would be better to provide less information and let the person know what to do next. For example, if you are giving someone directions, you should not include the route you took or the way to your house. You should just tell them where you live. 
Commissive dialogueacts are for making commitments. If you were giving a speech, your last line would not be ""Thank you for coming. See you next year!"". That would a Commissive Dialogue Act, because you would make a promise to come back next years. However, in this example the given statement is a request for a call back, not a committment.

"
2244,"""i"" is an indirect object pronoun, and it indicates that the speaker is referring to something that ""i,"" the addressee. In this case, ""seafood"" (a seafood restaurant). 
  
  ""on my"" indicates the action is performed on ""my,"" which indicates a personal relationship. 
    
In this context, this is likely a reference to the fact that pizza is generally eaten with a fork and knife, not with one's hands.

"
2245,"In this example, inform is the most likely dialogue action. Mike is sharing his current situation and asking a factual question about whether or not they have any maps available of a downtown location. Inform is a good choice because it indicates Mike's situation is being shared, not asked for or committed to.

"
2246,"In this example, tuna is not a type of tea, but a fish. Therefore, it does make sense for this person to ask ""yes"" to whether there were other kinds of Teas available.

"
2247,"Question: takeaway
Inform: here
Directive: don't eat there
Commissive : don’t eat takeaways

Would you like to order a take-away? 
  
  Yes, I’d like a chicken, rice, vegetable curry, salad, naan bread, sweet chilli sauce, garlic naans, roti, potato curry and naani chutney. 
   
That would be great, thank you!

"
2248,"Inform is used when the information is not particularly important or relevant to the conversation. For example, when a customer service representative is providing basic information to a caller, inform is more appropriate than question or directive. 
  
Question is often used to indicate a perceived need for more information. When a person asks a simple question that requires no further explanation, such as ""Is it hot in here?"" question is less appropriate and a directive question such ""Can you pass the salt?"" is appropriate. However, if a listener is confused about an aspect of a conversation, they may need to ask for clarification. In this case, a direct question like ""What is the weather like outside?"" would likely be perceived as a query rather than a statement of fact. A question may also be used in a command or request form. ""Would you like some coffee?"" could be a declarative statement, or a polite request in which the listener could choose to answer with a yes or no. If the questioner is expecting a response in the affirmative, then a commanding form of question would occur, ""Yes, please."" If they are expecting an affirmative answer, and the other person does not respond in that form, it could indicate that they do not understand the request, so a commissitive form would follow, for example ""No, I would not like any coffee.""
Directive is typically used for a strong request or order. Directive questions are often perceived negatively, although they can also have positive connotations. The listener may perceive a demand for action, an order, instructions, suggestions, etc. It is important to note that a Commissive form is only used if the order is to someone else, not if it's to oneself.

"
2249,"""over"" is used to indicate a higher priority or urgency than the other options. In this case, ""overinform"", ""overshadow"", or ""outrun"" would be more appropriate. 
the word ""as sooner"" indicates a timeframe, so ""soon"" or even ""right away"" might be better. 
  

In summary, since the given piece is a directive command rather then a request for information or a comment, I classified it as a ""directive"" dialogue action.

"
2250,"This text uses the word 'problem' to describe an issue. This is an indication that this is likely a complaint or a request for assistance. 
  
  The text also uses'slow down' and'speed up' in the same sentence, suggesting that there is more than one possible interpretation of the traffic light meaning. In this case, 'yellow means speed down not slow up.' 
   
Finally, this sentence starts 'Weren’t you...', which indicates that 'the speaker' is questioning the 'listener' about their knowledge or understanding.

"
2251,"Question is the most common dialogue-act pattern in this context. The question mark indicates a doubt or uncertainty in what the person being talked to is saying. In this case, it's unclear whether the Chinese person is able to live ""without"" tea. If the answer is ""yes"", then the question is likely to ask for more information. On the contrary, if the response is that they cannot live with out tea, then it will likely be a statement. 
  
Out of the four possible dialogue acts, Question is one of two that can be used to express uncertainty. When used in a request for information, a Question mark can indicate that you are not sure if you have provided all the information that is needed to make an accurate decision. 
In this example, ""can i"" is used as a preposition to introduce the topic of tea to a person. ""Can I help You?"" is a common question that indicates uncertainty about whether or not the asker is capable of helping the listener.  The use of a ""question"" mark in front of ""help you"" indicates the user is not certain if they are able and willing to help the receiver.

"
2252,"""i"" is the subject of the sentence, and ""need"" indicates a need for information. The use of ""some"" suggests that there may be more than one option. Therefore, this is a request for more information, classified under directive. 
In the second sentence ""an upset"" stomach suggests there is something wrong with ""your"" body. ""Your"" could be the pronoun of an individual, indicating that this person is feeling unwell. In this case, ""you"" would be asking about a medical issue. 
  

A:
According to the GECOSGOS, there are 4 possible dialogue acts: 

 
Out of Inform: This is used when the receiver is being provided with information for which the asker is unaware. For example, a salesman may ask for a customer's name and the customer is providing the name for him. Out ofinform is often used in a negative form, when a person or thing is trying to hide something.
 
Question: When the person asking the question is also providing information and is unsure of something, then this act may occur. A sales person may provide the price of goods and ask the buyer if they are interested in purchasing. Here, both the inform and question acts may have occurred. 
 
Directive:  This is when someone is telling someone else what to do.  For example a teacher may tell a student to clean their room. Directive is usually used on a positive note, to describe a situation where someone or something is doing something good.
 

 commissives: These are used to show that someone has agreed to something or is performing an action. They are usually negative. An example of commissiveness is ""I will go if you go"".  These acts are not used often.

"
2253,"This text can also be classified under question dialogue acts if we consider the word'suffering' in the preceding sentence. The word can mean 'physical pain' or 'feeling ill'. The speaker may be suffering physically from the cold weather and may also feel ill due to the recent flu epidemic. In this case, they may ask the question of whether the person is suffering both physically and mentally from cold and flu. However, this is unlikely as the context of the sentence is related to current circumstances and not the past. 
  
In this context, we can classify the dialogue as inform because the given statement can indicate that someone is expressing gratitude or offering an assurance.

"
2254,"In this example, 'yes' is providing confirmation or information. The speaker confirms that John has the 'runs' and is happy for us to know this. 
  

A:
According to the dialogue acts defined by the NLP community, your text is classified correctly as a ""question"".
Out of the four possible dialogue actions, ""Question"" is the most common, appearing in around 50% of questions. ""Inform"" appears in about 20% questions, while ""Directive"" and ""Commissive"", appear in less than 10% each.

"
2255,"In this example, ""one moment"" indicates that the request is urgent and should be fulfilled immediately. The speaker does not want to waste any time and is expecting a prompt response. Based on this, we can classify this as being a commissIVE dialogueact. 
  
""one tablet"" could be a command or instruction, so this is a Commissive dialogueAct.

"
2256,"When the message is asking for information from a recipient (such as ""are you sure?"" or ""what do you mean?"")

This is because the question is being asked by a person seeking confirmation or feedback from another person. 
  
  When a message contains a command or instruction (for example, ""put the phone on charge"" or “call your mom”),
Because the command is given by one person to another, it's a direct order, not a query.

"
2257,"inform is used when the information is already known to the person being
told, so there is no need to ask for it. 
question is when someone is trying to find out more
information, and is therefore asking a
follow-up question
directive is for when you want to tell someone what to do
commissive indicates when a person is being blamed for something

A:
According to your text: ""What were the kids?"" the answer is ""They were your kids.""
So the question is: what were those kids?
In this case, it's a direct question: the subject is the children, they are asking what those children were.

"
2258,"In this case, it is likely that ""they"" (the listener) are seeking advice or guidance from the ""you"" (""the speaker"") on how to continue to take the medication. The ""them"" is the patient, and the question is ""How long"" should the individual continue ""taking them?"". 
  
This is a request for advice, not a query.

"
2259,"Inform and question are dialogue Acts that are less likely to be directive. 
Question is the most likely dialogue Act in this example, so the model predicts question. However, inform and directive are also possible, therefore the dialogueact has to match one of these two. In this case, based on your explanation, we predict directive as the correct answer.

"
2260,"This text indicates a lack of personal autonomy by suggesting that a person should follow the dietary preferences of others. This is a strong indication that this is an order, not a request for information. 
  
If the dialogue acts had been question or directive instead of commissIVE, then it would have been considered a directive request.

"
2261,"Question is the most general dialogueact. It is used to seek information from the other person. In this case, it seems that ticket is being used as a noun to refer to a person or an entity, and the person is asking for clarification. 
Overinform is another general term used for predicting the answer to the question. Based on this sentence, ticket does not have any preference for a chair, so it would be overinform to predict that he has a preference.

"
2262,"""yes."" is an affirmative statement that indicates the inform act was likely used. 
  ""i want"" is a statement of desire, indicating the question act may have been used instead. 
Inform is the most common dialogue acts, and it is used to provide factual information. It is also used when someone is giving advice or guidance.

"
2263,"This text contains a command or request to put the bag on a scale, suggesting that it be weighed. 
  
  The use of the word ""sure"" in the request is a strong indicator that this is an order, as it implies that failure to comply will result in punishment. Additionally, ""please"" is used as the polite form of ""excuse me"" or ""sorry"", suggesting a sense of urgency.

"
2264,"This text does not provide any information to the asker, but rather seeks information out from them. As such, it could be considered a query. 
  
However, this is not the only factor to consider. In the second half of the paragraph, there is another text that is also a request for information. So, in this case, we can classify the first text as being a general question.

"
2265,"Overweight is a medical term used to describe having too much fat on your body. While the term is used in the medical field, it is neither a fact nor a diagnosis. The boarding tag and boarding passes provided to you are not medical documents, so it would be inappropriate to classify this as being overweight based on this information. 
  
However, if the boarding tags and passes were medical, then it could be considered as a factual statement that would require a declarative statement (i.e. 'Yours is overweight') rather then a request for information (e g, 'What am I supposed do?').

"
2266,"Mike is thesender ofthis message. Based on his relationship withthe recipient, it is likely that he is inquiring about them. The phrase""howare you"" is a way for Mike to seek information from therecipient. 
  
  The text also contains the phrases ""michael"", ""good tohear"", and ""from you"". These phrases provide additional context aboutMike's availability and interest in the conversation. Thesephrases also provide information that is not available in other parts ofthe message, such as the location of Mike. This additionalinformation may help the reader to understand more about him andhis interests.

"
2267,"the text asks a direct question which indicates that it is looking for a confirmation or response. 
there is no specific time mentioned in the question so it can be considered as a general question

based on this explanation, we can conclude that our predicted dialog act will be question

"
2268,"In this example, we can see that there is a lack of a request for information, a direct question or command. The only element that could be considered a 'question' is the time of the day, 3:25. However, this is only an inference, as the actual dialogue acts are not mentioned.

"
2269,"Question: the word ""are"" in the first sentence is a word that can function as a ""yes"" or ""NO"" question question mark. ""Are you"" is an affirmative statement that could be answered with a yes or no. In the second sentence, ""you"" refers to the same person as in first statement. Therefore, this is considered a YES question which can only be asked if a person is aware of something. 
  
Out ofinform: ""i"" and ""try"" are verbs, so they are not questions. They are actions. 
Overinform, Question, Directive, Commissive: all of these labels are used for questions, but this one is not a true question because ""drive"" does NOT function in this way. Drive is the verb for moving vehicles. So this label is incorrect.

"
2270,"Out of the four possible dialogue acts, inform is the only one that does NOT ask for advice, action, etc. from either party. Instead, it simply shares information between two parties.

"
2271,"Inform is used to provide information to someone about something that is happening at that moment. In this case, it’s used by the driver to inform the physician of their headache. 
  
Overinform is similar toinform, except that you are giving too much information. The driver is giving the information they need to the medical professional, so they are overinform. 
Question is another way of providing relevant information, and is often used when you want to find out something from someone. Here, because the question is about a test that was administered to them, they’re asking.  They’ve asked a direct question and are therefore commissively speaking.   
Directive is when someone is telling someone else what to or how to act. Because the person asking the questions is being instructed to go to another location (the other side of a terminal), they're directive
Commissive, like question but asking someone who is acting on instructions to perform an action to, is what I would call commissing.

"
2272,"Directive is the most general dialogueact, indicating that someone is giving permission to do something or is requesting another opportunity. 
  In this case, Mike is telling the person he’s talking to that he should try to run again when they get off the plane. 
Question is used when someone wants to know something. In this example, ""How are You?"" is being asked by Mike, meaning he wants information.

"
2273,"Out of Commissive, over Commissively, commands the actor to do something, such as ""get back to work!"". 
  
  Out Of Commissives, inform the receiver of information, like ""I’m on my way!"" or ""Here’s the information you requested"". 
   
 Out Of Question, ask the question ""Am I on time?"".

"
2274,"Directive is the most general type of dialogue acts. Directives are used when the two participants have a pre-existing relationship, and the conversation is about how to continue the relationship. For example, you might ask a friend for their phone number so you could call them, so that you are not left with a dead phone. 
  
In this case, KARA is not a new friend, nor is she being asked for her phone or number. Rather, she is being told that i need  to get  my high-speed internet  installed. This is an order, not an invitation to chat.

"
2275,"""Please make the appointment"" is a request for a command, not an invitation to a conversation.

"
2276,"Out of the four possible dialogue acts, only directive is used in this context. The recipient is being told to do something, or asked to perform a task.

"
2277,"In the above text the question mark indicates the dialogue acts are over-predicted. In other words, this is text that is actually a request for a recommendation or suggestion. 
'What day?' is an example of a statement that can be followed by a suggestion or recommendation. 
  'Would you prefer Friday or Saturday?' can also be considered a  suggestion or a recommended action.

"
2278,"Question: ""is Friday good?"" seeks information from the listener. 
Overinform: the message is too much information for the question. The answer is ""yes"" or ""no"" so the information provided is redundant. 
  Question is for information. Overinform is providing too many details.  
  Directive: this is a command. Don't forget to pay your bills on time!
Directives are for instructions and orders. They are not for general conversation.

"
2279,"In the example provided, we can see that the dialogue acts are not question or command. The speaker in that example is not asking the listener to do anything, nor is it giving a direct order. Therefore, this is an inform text.

"
2280,"Question dialogue acts are used to seek information from another person, and they are less likely to occur in a conversation between strangers. 
In this case,'shall we' is a statement of fact, not a request for opinion or advice. So, this question dialogue action is over-represented in this conversation.

"
2281," commissives are typically used when someone is requesting information or assistance from another person, and is not seeking or offering their own assistance. In this case, it is likely that you will be asked to leave the building, so you should politely ask the person asking you to do so to avoid causing a scene.

"
2282,"Inform: Mike is not available on Saturday. 
Question: Why is Mike not able to attend the event?  Mike is the organizer of the meeting. 
  Based on the text, it is asking a question about why  Mike  is not able to attend  the event.   

Directive: Please reschedule the meetup.  
Commissive : I'll pass this request up  to Michael.

"
2283,"This text indicates the need for action, so it is a request for the caller to take some type of action. 
  
  The text is asking if the callee ran the redlight, and if so, whether they will accept a apology from the caller. The callers actions are implied to have consequences, either accepting or rejecting the apology. Therefore, this is classified commissively.

"
2284,"""howmuchisit"" is a request for an explanation of the price or cost of an item. The ""question"" act would be appropriate in this context. 
However, ""iknow.i kn ow. im really sorrry.ilostmybag."" is an acknowledgement of a loss, followed by an expression of regret. In this case, it is more likely that ""questio""n"" (question) is being used in the context of requesting information.

"
2285,"In the first sentence, ""you haven’t seen [my company] car have  you?"" the question mark indicates a request for further information, and the use of ""have you?"" indicates uncertainty. 
""i’m sorry"" is an expression of regret, not an inquiry. 
  
However, in the second sentence ""i lost [bag]."" the word ""lost"" indicates an action that results in a loss, so the sentence can also be classified a statement of fact, with a commissIVE (or directive) response.

"
2286,"It provides useful information about the weather today. 
While it does provide information, there is no question in it, so it's over-classified as informational. Additionally, while it asks a 'question', it doesn't actually have a clear question or request, and so is classified under 'over' as well. Finally, although it has a directive dialogueact, this is not the only possible dialogue action, as there are several requests and commands in this passage.

"
2287,"In the example provided, there is no question asked, no directive given, nor is there a commitment made. Instead, a simple statement is provided about a person’s physical state. This is an example of information sharing.

"
2288,"This text does provide specific details about when it might rain, so it likely falls into the inform category. However, it does ask another question - when is it going to rain? - which indicates it should be categorized as question. 
  
  The text also gives a suggestion - 'you might want to bring an umbrella' - that could be considered directive or commissitive.

"
2289,"In this example, inform is the correct dialogue action because the information provided is about the speakers family and they are sharing it.  Directive is also a possibility because of the command or request that was made of their. Commissive would also be a valid dialogue label, but in this case it is redundant as Commissives are typically used in negotiations and are not relevant in a request for information.

"
2290,"Question: ask a direct question to get an answer
Inform: provide general information
Directive: give a order
Commissive : make a pledge
Over: more than one of the above

"
2291,"Rain is a natural phenomenon that cleARS the atmosphere. It does not ask for confirmation or clarification. Therefore, it is an over-informative dialogueact. 
  
  Rain cleARES the atmOSPHER. That is what it does. So asking about whether it cleares the atmospheric is redundant.

"
2292,"Inform is used when the information being provided is not important, but the person providing the statement is still trying hard to provide the necessary information. For example, a sales associate might inform a customer about an upcoming sale, without being too eager to share this information with the customer. 
  
Question is often used to seek clarification or to request additional information, especially from a witness or a third party.

"
2293,"""how"" is a way to seek information. 
the speaker wants to know how to best enjoy the weather after a rain.

"
2294,"Question dialogue acts are characterized by their participants asking questions, providing or requesting information from the other person, and making requests or commitments. 
In this example, it appears that both the questioner and the questioned are expressing desires or requests for something to happen. In particular, both are asking the same person to take some action. 
  
Directive dialogue Acts are typically characterized as being instructions or orders from one person (the directive speaker) to another (usually the addressee). 
   
Commissive acts can be used when one party is making an offer or promise to the recipient.

"
2295,"""can I have a try?"" is a question. The speaker wants to know if the other person is willing to give it another shot. 
""'can you try this again?'"" is an order. It is the same as ""'please try it again.'""
'i'd rather try together' is cooperative. 
"
2296,"Inform is the most common dialogue acts in text messages. It is used to share information that is straightforward and does not require further explanation. For example, ""it is raining"" is aninformative statement that does explain the cause of the rain, but an inform message would be ""are you ready to go to the park?"". 
  
Question is a directive dialogueact that asks a follow up question. An example of aquestion in this context is ""why is it rained?"" 
   
Directive is another directive dialogicact used when the sender wants to give an instruction to another person. In this case, it would mean that the message is not intended for a specific recipient, so the recipient should ignore it.An example is when a person wants another to call them, they would use the directive act.  

"
2297,"This text contains information that is not characteristic of any of
  the other four dialogue acts. Information about an arrest is shared
without asking any questions or providing any details. This indicates
that the information was provided to the person being told about it
because the author was informing them. 
In addition, this is the only text in the passage that contains the
phrase "" i want "" which is a characteristic feature of questions. 
  This indicates this was a direct question asked by this person.

"
2298,"In this example, we can see that this is an example of directive act, as the message is clearly asking the table to provide a detailed table. The message does this by expressing a wish or desire to see a more detailed version of something. In this case, it is the provided table, but it could be anything. 
This is because this type of message often indicates a need for a person to take action, and is often used in a commanding or directive way. 
  

A:
According to the definition of Dialogue Act from the OpenAI GPT model, your predicted result is correct.

"
2299,"Because the response indicates the listener should not expect any information from the person asking the question - the reservation of the table indicates there is no information available to share. 
  
Or, because the book in question is not available, so the answer is simply no.

"
2300,"Directive dialogue acts are used when the speaker is attempting to influence the listener to take an action. In this example, a restaurant is suggesting that the customer order for 4 people. 
  
Question dialogue Acts are when someone is looking for an explanation or answer. The restaurant's question ""do  you have  a table  for four?"" indicates that they are looking to confirm the information provided in the previous sentence. 
Inform dialogue Act is used to provide information to a recipient. ""yes i fear there  are not  enough outlets"" indicates a lack of information and is classified under this dialogue type.

"
2301,"'yes' is a confirmation of a statement made earlier in the same text. 'Yes, I have smoked.'. 
Smoking or Non-Smoker? - This is an informative statement. The answer to this question is provided in a text fragment'smoking'.

A:
According to the book ""Dialogue: A Theory of Construction"", the following are the most common types of dialogue acts: 

 
Directive: This type of act indicates the speakers desire to have a conversation about a particular topic.  
Question:  This type indicates a desire for information.   
Request:   This indicates an action that is desired by the addressee. 
           This is the least common type and indicates there is no desire on behalf of the speake
           r to engage in this type  of conversation.

"
2302,"Directives are commands or requests for action. In this case, ""a non- smoking  table"" is requesting a table without smoking. 
  
Inform dialogue acts are used when someone is giving information. This text does not appear to fit this category. Instead, this is more likely a direct request for a specific table.

"
2303,"Directives are used to express a request or order to another person. They are not questions, and they do not allow for a response. 
  
  In this example, 'come along, now' is a direct order. 'Please come along' would be a more appropriate directive.

"
2304,"Question is a way of seeking information from another person. The question ""is there a quicker"" implies the questioner is looking for an answer to an open-ended question and is therefore seeking guidance from their interlocutor. 
  
In contrast, directives are a guiding way for the conversational partner to move the topic forward. In this example, ""there is no quicker"", which can be interpreted as a statement of fact, is being offered as guidance to help the person asking the questions to arrive at a decision.

"
2305,"In this example, taxi is a noun, so the dialogue acts of provide, ask, promise and directive apply. However, since the taxi service is being requested, not provided, inform is the correct choice for the current situation.

"
2306,"Question: ""how"" is used in the sentence ""How much does that cost?"". In this context, ""that"" refers to ""cost"" and "" how much"" indicates a measurement of cost. Therefore, this is a query asking for a measure of the cost of something. 
Inform:  ""How"" does NOT appear in this sentence. Instead, a direct object (the cost) is mentioned, and the question is ""Does that price include delivery?"" which can be answered with a yes or no.

"
2307,"In this example, ""it is not a problem"" is a general statement that does
not indicate a preference or a requirement. The speaker could have
included this statement without indicating that it was a generic
statement. For example: ""It is no problems for you to Travel frequently.""

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible dialogue acts for a given text: 
inform, ask, direct, commis
If the answer is ""yes"" to a yes/no question then the inform dialogue is the most likely. If the question is about someone's preference then it would be a request. A command would come from a direct question. Finally, a commissives would indicate that a statement is being made in the future.

"
2308,"English is not the native language of the driver. 
There is no indication that they are giving any instructions or directions. 
  
If the answer is 'yes', then the dialogue acts of both the question and the response are question because the information provided in the first part of text (the drivers name) is insufficient to make a decision about whether they speak English or not.

"
2309,"Inform is better expressed as ""some"" than as a comparison. ""Some"" conveys a sense of uncertainty, whereas ""better"" implies certainty. 
""But, "" you should not have problem with it. 
  This is an example of Commissive. Commissives are used to request a change in behavior or action.

"
2310,"In this example, ""are the rose safe?"" is a yes/no question that is being asked by the character. The speaker does not want to know the answer, but wants to make sure that they are not putting the recipient at risk. In this context, asking the question is more of a directive than a commissIVE. 
  
  The text does provide information that may be relevant to the safety of the flowers, such as ""roses are a type of flower that are very popular among tea drinkers."" However, this is not a direct answer to ""is the flower safe,"" so it does fall into the category of question rather than inform.

"
2311,"In this example, ""for most parts, yeah"" is a non-question answer to a yes/no question. It is not seeking clarification or confirmation, so it should be classified under inform. However, if a person is uncomfortable with the answer, they can always decline the invitation.

"
2312,"Directive dialogue acts are used when the other person's behavior is being guided or influenced. For example, a salesperson might ask a customer to fill out a form, and the customer is free to ignore the request but is likely to feel pressured if they are being told to complete a task. 
  
In contrast, inform dialogue Acts are more about sharing information. The other party is not being influenced or guided, so the inform act may be used.

"
2313,"Question is the most likely dialogueact given the context of the conversation. The question is about a time, and the asker is looking for an estimate. 
Sure. What time would you like to leave?

"
2314,"This text indicates the speakers desire for something to happen at a specific time. The time is important, so the directive dialogue acts are used. 
  
  ""at 3:30"" is the time, and the ""could you please bring my bag"" part is what the server should do.

"
2315,"In this example, inform is the most likely dialogueact, as the information provided is about a current event that is of interest to both the sender and the receiver. Inform is also the second most common dialogue-act sequence, following question.

"
2316,"the text indicates the desire to work on body parts, not a requirement to pass a test
it is not clear what the question is, and the answer could be either yes or no
this is a conversation between two people, therefore the conversation act should be commissitive

A:
According to your explanation, it seems like the person asking the questions is trying to get the opinion of the other person. So the response should contain the following elements: 
1. Yes or No: the receiver should answer with either Yes/No.  If the request is for confirmation, then the reply should also contain confirmation. For example, ""yes I passed the driving exam, what did you pass?""
2. The question: the receiver can ask the originator of question to clarify the issue. For example ""what did I pass? I passed with a score of 90%. What did you pass?"", or ""I don't understand the meaning of 'pass'. Can you please explain it to me?"".

"
2317,"In this example, ""weekly schedule"" is a factual piece information, not a request for clarification or a statement of intention. Therefore, this is an inform text. 
However, if the ""schedule"" were a hypothetical question or statement expressing an intention, then it would be classified under question and directive.

"
2318,"Directives are used when someone is giving instructions or telling someone what to do. In this case, it's the opposite: the person is telling the listener what they are doing. 
Question: While this is not a direct question in the strictest sense, ""c'mon. are we only going to switch two legs or all six?"" is an example of a questioning statement. The question is posed to the addressee, but the statement is directed to a third party, in this instance the narrator. 
  The addressees response indicates they were not expecting this switch, so it can also be classified a query.

"
2319,"In the first line, 'are you ready?' is a prelude to a dialogue. The speaker, Alex, is preparing to begin a conversation with the person he is speaking to, Randy. In the second line 'have you seen the company's car?',  Alex is posing a direct question to Randy, who is the only person mentioned in the previous two lines.  In line 3, ‘would  you tell  me something  about your  family?’  Randy responds to Alex’s question by providing information, and in line 4, “can  i have  another try?’ Randy asks Alex for a second chance. 
  Based  on the context of these lines, we can conclude that Alex is trying to get Randy to disclose information regarding his family and that Randy has agreed to do so.

"
2320,"Inform is a request for further information, and this is an example of a good question: ""why"" is the question that prompts further explanation. 
  
  Out ofinform: This is not a typical question; it is more of  a statement. The speaker does not need to ask ""Why"" because the information is already known. In this case, ""my friend told me that i could switch from day shift to nightshift.""

Question: this question is typical and requires an ""answer"". The question ""but why?"" is what prompts explanation of the statement ""i was allowed to change to nightshift"".
Out Of question : this does make sense, but the answer is ""because i asked my friend who is also my supervisor to help me"". 
   
Directive:  This is another typical directive question and it requires action. ""Cook dinner"" indicates a need for someone to take action, so the directive is for the addressee to cook dinner
 Commissive : This question can be answered with a command, however, this one is considered over Commissives.  The text does indicate that this person has authority, therefore, a Commissivedirective is overused.

"
2321,"This text contains a general statement about how the world works, where there is no specific request for a reply or information. As such, it can be classified under the general category of 'I knew' and is not a dialogue question or response.

"
2322,"In this example, we can see that inform is the most likely dialogue
  act, as the given statement is an assessment of a person's behavior,

A:
According to this article, there are 4 possible dialogue acts for a given sentence: question(out out question directive commissives), command(question out command directive), request(directive question commissIVE), and information(inform out inform question).  
I would say that this sentence is best classified under the inform dialogue action: ""the speaker(s) is/are giving information"".  The other dialogue actions are not applicable.

"
2323,"This text is asking for information, so the dialogue acts are inform and question. 
However, this is the first time the writer has asked for this information. So, it is possible that they are looking for a job and want to know if the candidate has any open positions. In this case, they would be asking question and not inform because they already know the answer.

"
2324,"Inform is a prediction that is made based on a given context and the
  predicted next utterance based off that context. In this case, Mike is

giving information to someone,
requesting information from someone
telling someone what to expect
making a request
committing to something
asking a direct question
questioning someone's intentions
providing information that someone is asking for
expressing a desire to have something happen
sharing information with someone that they have discovered
saying goodbye to a person
indicating that a time period is coming to an end
predicting that something will happen in a future time
stating that an event is over
confirming something that has already been said
suggesting an action that will be taken
offering an opinion
warning someone of a danger
reporting that there is an emergency
declaring that some event has begun
announcing that you are about to begin a task
communicating a message that was sent to you
explaining something to another person that helps them understand
pointing out something for someone to see
reminding someone something they forgot
mentioning the name of someone or something

"
2325,"Question dialogue acts are used to seek information from the other person. In this case, it appears that the speaker is seeking information regarding the listener's future plans. 
  

let me know when you are ready to begin your journey!
I will let youknow when I am readyto begin my journey.

"
2326,"overinform: the dialogue acts inform and overinform describe the same act, namely conveying one's understanding of something. The inform act conveys one’s understanding or acknowledgement of information, whereas the overinformed act also conveives one' understanding, but conveyses it in a more general way. 
question: ""question"" is the most common type of dialogue action, and it is used to ask a follow-up question to a previous question or to express uncertainty. In this case, ""is a queensize bed ok?"" is followed by a ""yes"" or ""no"" question which is classified here as question
directive: a directive dialogueact is one used when the main purpose is to give orders. ""Do you thing you could manage the docks guys?"" would be a good example of using a direct dialogueaction. 
 commissives: commissived dialogueacts are used in requests for information or confirmation.  ""Do You think You could make Yourself understood In English?"".

"
2327,"Over-prediction is common in machine learning models. In this case, it's likely because the model is trained on data from a single source, and the data does include some examples of question and directive acts.

"
2328,"Question: the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates the
  text is likely seeking clarification or information from its
 conversation partners. 
  

In this case, it's likely the person asking is looking for information on what other family members do. 
Directive: in this context, a command or order is being given. The person who asked is telling the other person to tell them something. In this example, I would be giving an order to my colleague to help me with something I asked them to do (help me). 
   
Next, may I help You, Sir? is an example of giving direction to another person.  The person giving the direction is the one who is helping me. I am asking my co-worker for help.

"
2329,"Mr.Sandals is not a person, so he cannot answer the question of when the space is required. 
This text does ask for information, as it asks when Mr Sandels needs the bank space.

"
2330,"This is because the response provided by the author is not a definitive answer to the question of whether the account type is available or not. It is merely a recommendation based on general availability. A more definitive response would be either a statement or an offer of assistance.

"
2331,"Inform: the dialogue acts inform and question provide the same amount of information, so the choice between the two is based on preference. Inform indicates a speaker sharing information to a listener, whereas question indicates the need for information from thelistener. 
Directive: a directive dialogueact is used when a person or entity is being instructed to perform an action. 
  In this case, a youngman is asked to tell the story of how the boat gotstarted. A directive act would be used to direct theyoung manto begin thestory.

"
2332,"Inform is a question dialogueact, because it is asking a follow-up question. The question is ""how much is the minimum required balance?"". 
  
Question is another dialogueAct, it can be used to ask a direct question or to seek information. In this case, we are seeking information, so it leans towards question 
   
Directive is also another possible dialogue Act, this is an order or request for action. Here, they are asking us to open a new account.

"
2333,"In the given example, it is clear that this person is giving instructions or advice to another person. Specifically, they state that they like having easy and immediate access of their money, that it's no big deal for them to go on frequent travels, but they would prefer a checking account instead of a savings account (which is also an option). 
  
  The text does provide information, however it does so in the form of instructions. For example:

'yes','i'm''young', and 'unmarried'. 
    
These are all preferences or circumstances that are not being questioned, commanded, promised, etc. 
      
Therefore, this is an example of directive text.

"
2334,"This text is offering information to confirm a statement from the previous sentence. 'Of course I do' is the confirmative statement, so the dialogue acts of question and inform have been applied to it. 
However, this is also a request for a service, in this case, over-draft insurance. So the question mark has also been assigned the commissIVE dialogue tag.

"
2335,"This text is classified commissively because it expresses a wish or a desire for something to be done, but does so in a way that does  not seek confirmation or refusal. For example, 'you can’t do that' or 'I hope you don’ t do it.' This is typical of commissives.

"
2336,"In this example, we can see that the given statement is a direct order to the person being arrested to sign a form. The order is given in the form of an instruction, command and a reason. 
  The reason is that we are going to be'all - set'if the arrested person fills out the paperwork correctly. There's no sharing of information or seeking of confirmation here; the order itself is clear and explicit.

"
2337,"Directives are statements that tell someone what to do. They are not questions, and they do not include information as a part of their meaning. Therefore, this is a clear example of an directive dialogueact. 
  
Overinform is another label for this dialogue action, but it can also be used to describe a situation where the information provided is too much or too little. In this case, it would be toomuch, as the provided information is not enough to make an informed decision.

"
2338,"the text asks the question of whether the person has seen the car and then directs the answer to the check engine part. The question is a request for information, and the directive act can also be used to direct another person to perform an action. 
  

A:
According to this page, ""question"" is one of four possible labels for a dialogue tag.  The other three are ""inform"", ""request"", and ""command"".  ""Request"" and 'request' are the same word, but have different meanings.

"
2339,"Question dialogue acts are used to clarify or request information from the other person. In this case, it is unclear whether the person is being asked a clarification or is requesting assistance in making decisions. Therefore, a direct question is implied. 
  
  Out of question: ""I'm not sure. Do you need help?""
Out Of question. ""Do you have any questions?"" ""No, I’m good.""

Inform dialogue Acts are for conveying facts or giving straightforward information. Here, there is no question or directive request. Instead, this is an informational statement.

"
2340,"In the beginning of text the request is for the person to look into the company's car (which is not possible without revealing that this is a company vehicle). 
Later on in the same text it becomes clear that there is something longer in need of being transported than the car and the question mark indicates a request for more information or details.

"
2341,"Question dialogue acts are used to probe for information, clarify the meaning of the message, and request clarification. In this case, we can interpret the question as asking how the pay for this item. 
In addition, there is a request for clarification, as the dialogue partner is expected to provide an answer to this question.

"
2342,"Inform (72%)
Question (12%) 
Directive (8%) 
  
 commissIVE (4%)

"
2343,"Question is a sub-type of directive. Question words include the words ‘why’, ‘what’, and ‘when’. These words suggest a need for information, direction, a request for assistance, an invitation to action, etc. 
  
  In this case, ‘where’ and 'how’ are the questions. Based on this context, it seems like the question is asking John to provide details about his holiday plans.

"
2344,"Yes, this is an indication that this dialogue acts is likely a request for assistance, rather than a statement of fact or a recommendation.

"
2345,"Question is one of the most common and important dialogue acts. Dialogue acts classify the type of information that is being provided. In this case, it is asking where John is going. The other choices are not applicable in this context.

"
2346,"In this case, ""paris"" is the subject of the sentence, and ""going to par"" refers to an action that is going take place in the near future. Based on this context, it makes sense to ask why par is being referred to. ""Nice"" and the ""train to Nice"" are the location of two actions that are going on at the same time, so it would be redundant to mention ""nice"" in this sentence. Therefore, we predict that this is an inform text. 
  
""going on"" can be interpreted as a verb, but in context it seems like it should be an adjective. In this interpretation, going ""on"" to something implies that something is happening, while going going is used to express a continuous action. Since Nice is not mentioned in between, this makes more sense. So, in our prediction, that interpretation is chosen.

"
2347,"This text uses the word ‘i’ a lot, indicating that the speaker is trying to convince the reader of something (i.e. they expect something to happen). This is a characteristic of a commissIVE dialogue acts. 
  
However, it also uses ‘you’ and ‘expect’ which could indicate that this is an instruction or a request, and not a command. Therefore, this could be classified under the question dialogue category.

"
2348,"the text does not provide any information or confirmation, but rather suggests an action that is not necessarily sought by the person reading the message. 
it is an offer of assistance, and the offer is made by a person who is in a superior position to the receiver, so the communication is considered to have a higher degree of authority.

"
2349,"Directive dialogue acts are used to ask someone to do something, and are not answered. They are usually used when the information provided does  not fully answer the question and the asker is expecting a certain answer. For example, ""Would you like a drink?"" ""yes, a whiskey and soda, thanks.""

In this case, you asked me for a price for the flowers, but I already told you that I do not sell them. Therefore, I did not need to provide you with a reply.

"
2350,"the text is considered commissIVE because it contains an order or a request, and orders or requests are commissives
based on context, it seems like the person who received the photo is the addressee of the message, so the order is to the recipient, not to me

text: ‘bother, dont worry, i’ll!’
Dialogue act: commissivo (order, request)

"
2351,"In the first sentence, 'it’s nice to meet you' is a general statement of good will. 
However, in subsequent sentences, there is mention of a current situation where the addressee is unable to deal well with distracting circumstances. This suggests the current meeting is not a social one, where pleasantries are exchanged, as it is more of an informational meeting where only certain information is exchanged. In this case, inform is the most appropriate dialogue action.

"
2352,"In the beginning of the conversation, both the sender and the receiver have a common interest in establishing a relationship. The sender is introducing themselves and sharing information that is relevant to their identity. For example, they mention that they have three family members. Based on this information the listener can understand that this person is likely a family member of theirs. 
  
Later in this conversation the two participants have different interests. At this point, there is no longer a need for establishing the relationship between the participants. Therefore, from the perspective of establishing this relationship, this dialogue acts as a request for information. In other words, at this stage the information provided by the sende is not relevant anymore to the identity of either the participant or the other. As a result, based on their interest, either party can request a change in dialogue to a more appropriate one. 
For example:

'it's nice' to be met by you too.'

"
2353,"In this example, ""i"" is the first person in the conversation, and ""I am"" would be the third person. The first and third persons are typically used to introduce a new subject or to express certainty. In this case, I am introducing myself, indicating that I would like to continue the discussion. 
  
  The second person is ""happy"" and indicates a desire for the conversational partner to proceed. ""Happy"" can also be used as an adverb to describe a state or condition. Here, it indicates an indication of happiness or satisfaction.

"
2354,"Question: ""Would you Like to Ask Me Anything?"" indicates the question mark is a request for information from the listener. 
Overinform: the phrase overinform indicates this is an overuse of information, where the information provided is not needed. In this case, ""would like"" is needed instead. 
  
Would You Like To Ask ME Anything? 
      
      Yes, I would like you to question me about anything you'd like.

"
2355,"Question dialogue acts are used to ask questions, such as ""why"" or ""what"". In this case, it seems that the question is about the definition of marriage, and the answer will help clarify the topic. 
Inform dialogue Acts are for providing general information, like ""it's raining"", or providing background information for the conversation, ""we were just talking about..."". Inform acts do not typically ask for action, so this is not a good example of aninform act. 
  
Directive dialogueacts are often associated with attempts to change the behavior of the other person, to encourage or compel them to take some action.  In this example, this act seems like the author is trying to convince the reader to support gay rights.

"
2356,"Out of question: This text does ask an open-ended question about everyone's right of love, but the question is not clearly stated as a request for information. The question could be interpreted as being about government regulation of who can love whom, and the answer could provide a legal interpretation of the topic. 
Over question : This is a more likely interpretation, as the dialogue acts of 'question', 'directive', and 'commitment' are more appropriate for the rest of text.

"
2357,"Question dialogue Acts are used to ask questions, and are typically used in a conversation when one person is trying to convince another person of something. In this case, it's asking if gay people should be allowed to get married. 
In this example, ""should gay couples be able to marry"" is the question. The answer is ""yes"" or ""no"".

Overinform dialogueacts are not used. They are only used when the person asking the questions does so in an overly enthusiastic or enthusiastic manner. For example: ""I can't believe I just ate a peanut, I'm going to die!"". 
  In that case the over-enthusiasm is overstating the facts, so the dialogueact of overinform is used instead.

"
2358,"This text contains a request or suggestion from the user, so it is classified under the commissives dialogue acts. 
However, it also contains information from a question to the answer, where it would be over-classified as a informational dialogue action, since the question is not answered.

"
2359,"Inform is the default dialogue action for text that provides useful information but does NOT ask, command or promise anything. The inform action is appropriate for any text providing useful, factual information. 
  
Question is used when the information being provided is a request for a response. A question may be followed by a statement to clarify or a direct answer. 
Directives are used to give instructions or recommendations. They are not questions and do not require a reply. Directives may include a time limit. Commands are words or phrases that tell someone to do something. When a person or thing is commanded, they must be done immediately. Promises are made to perform a certain action or to provide a benefit in the future. These are questions in reverse. If a future benefit is promised, it must occur before a present action must take place.

"
2360,"""but that"" indicates that the statement should be interpreted as a counterpoint to the previous statement. Therefore, this statement can be classified under inform because it provides the listener with information that contradicts the first statement (i.e., gay marriages are a good thing). 
  
  ""my view"" can also be considered an opinion, so this could also fall under ""informed."" 
   
However, ""but"" implies a negative sentiment, and therefore this is considered to fall into the over category.

"
2361,"Inform is a non-interactive statement that provides information about a current state or future event. It is used when the sender is not seeking information from the receiver but is simply sharing information. 
  
Question is an interactive statement used to seek information and make a request from another person. 
Directive is another interactive sentence used by a person to make an order to another. This is usually used in a business context. Commisive (or non commis) is the last interactive word in the sentence.

"
2362,"Inform is used to provide information without making any request or commitment, and is politer than question or directive. 
Question is the most common dialogue acts, but inform is more polite than it.  
Directive is another common dialog act, however in this case it seems the information is being requested, so it should be classified under question
Committive indicates the action is requested or committed, therefore it belongs in question

"
2363,"Directive is the most specific dialogue category, indicating that a person is giving an instruction or request. In this case, Mr. White is asking that Mr Smith speak with him. 
Overinform is another way of classifying this response. Mr White provided too much information, so Mr Smth did not know what to expect. 
  
Question is one of four subcategories of questions. The other three are commissives, questions of desire,  and questions about time.  In this example, 'now, if it's a Queen-Size bed is it okay' is questioning the answer. 'is it ok to sleep on a Queensize Bed?'.

"
2364,"In the first sentence, 'what is the current price' is a question that could be answered by providing the information in the second sentence. Therefore, this is an inform dialogue Act. 
However, in both the third and fourth sentences, there is no indication that Mr. White is providing information. Instead, he is giving directions or instructions. In the fifth and sixth sentences he asks a follow up question. Thus, Mr White's dialogue acts in this passage are question and directive and not inform or question of directive of which there are only two.

"
2365,"Question: No, I don ’t have one. 
Overinform: Yes, you do. I ’ ve seen your house on Zillow. 
  Question, Overinform, Question, Directive, Commissive: I’d like to see it. When do you think you will have it listed? 

 

A:

I think the answer is that it is a statement of fact, not a request for information.  The statement is not asking for details, it’s stating facts.

"
2366,"Inform is the best choice for the dialogue acts in this example because it is a statement about something that happened, not a request for information. The speaker was not seeking information, but instead was providing it.

"
2367,"Directive is the most extreme form of the four possible responses, where the response is not only incorrect, but actively harmful to both the sender and receiver. For example, if a person is in a car accident and the police ask them to call an ambulance, they should not call the ambulance. Instead, dial 9-1- 1 and ask for an emergency service. The person in the accident will likely suffer serious injury or even death if the person calls the wrong number and causes further damage to their vehicle or health. 
  
In contrast, inform is correct in this situation. After providing specific details about what the directive response would be, such as dialing 9 1 1, asking for emergency services, this is what was actually done. Inform is also the correct response if someone asks for more information, for example ""how is it going?"" or ""what do you think about this?"" In this case, it would not be harmful for the asker to provide more details, so inform would also be the appropriate response.

"
2368,"Directive is the most extreme form of communication, as it indicates a complete lack of regard for the other party’s preferences. The sender is not only telling the receiver what to do, but is also assuming that they know better than the latter what is best for them. This is because the sender has assumed the role of “superior” and is treating the communication as if it were a command. 
  
In this case, Mr Sandal’ers request for Michelle to come over to his office at a certain time is being told what he should do by Michelle. He is assuming he knows what would be best, since he is in control of his schedule and can decide when he wants to see Michelle, while she is unable to decide whether or not to accept his invitation. In this situation, it would not be appropriate for Mr Sander to assume that he has the right to tell Michelle what time to visit his offices, because he does not have the same level of control over Michelle’’ s schedule.

"
2369," commissives are used to express strong opinions or commands that are not appropriate for a social context. They are often used in a negative context, to tell someone to stop doing something. 
In this case, it seems that a strong leader would not have driven through the red traffic light, as this would be considered a serious offense. The speaker, however, is expressing a command that is inappropriate for the social situation, so the response should be classified commissively.

"
2370,"In this example, based on information provided in the given textual context, it is possible to predict that this is an inform dialogueact. First, ""ofcourse!"" indicates the tone of the dialogue is set by the proposer, and the information is not sought for confirmation. Second, 'it's' indicates this information comes from a third person, rather than the person asking the question or sharing the details, suggesting that it was provided to the asker. Third,  'it is' suggests the content is providing a description of something, again suggesting it does not seek confirmation from its addressee.

"
2371,"Inform is the best dialogueact for the statement ""the dialogue Act of the above text was classified inform"" because inform is a suitable response to an informational statement that does not contain a request, direction or promise.

"
2372,"Directive is the most likely dialogue acts for this type of text. The speaker wants the person they are speaking to to do something, and they do not provide any information to help the listener understand what they should do. 
In this case, it seems the sender is looking for the receiver's signature on a register, so they can fill it in and register the transaction.

"
2373,"Question: ""Which room?"" is a request for information, asking you to identify a room. The provided text does provide information that can help you identify the room, but it does so by providing a description of the different rooms and then asking if you recognize any of them. This is not a direct request to provide the information and does fall under question. 
  
In contrast, inform: the provided information is about weed and the names for it, not about rooms. ""Weed! pot. ganjah. mARY JANE some CHRONIC!"" is information provided to you, rather than a query. 
Directive: although the given information may be correct, it is the responsibility of someone else to take care of picking the person up at airport, therefore the directive label is applied.

"
2374,"In this example, we can see that there is an intention to share information or a plan, through the use of specific instructions on ingredients to be used in a recipe. The directive act can be further confirmed by seeing the mention of the $200 deposit, as this is typically a requirement for reservations.

"
2375,"Question is the most likely dialogueact because ""oh how awfull"" could be seen as a statement of fact, rather than a polite request. 
Directive is also a likely response as the manager is asking the caller for their help. 
  They are asking, not providing.

"
2376,"""directive"" is a dialogueact that is used when the speaker is trying to persuade or convince the listener of something. In this case, Mr. Green is the sender of the message and the recipient is mr green. The directive dialogue acts are: request, order, command and prohibition. 
over ""directly inform"", ""question"", and ""commissive"". ""comissIVE"" means to make a commitment or promise, so the directive act here is actually commissIVE.

"
2377,"This text uses the commissives ""out"" and ""he's"" to communicate information. The former is used to indicate that a person is no longer available to speak, while the latter is the name of a character in a book that is mentioned in the passage. 
  
  The text also uses question words like ""why"" in order to seek clarification. This is another characteristic trait of commissiveness.

"
2378,"In the beginning of the message, it is not clear whether the sender is interested in knowing the time or asking the receiver for the same. Based on this, this is considered to be a query. 
  
Later on in the conversation, when the question is answered, i.e. 'the time is 24 hours', the dialogue acts of both the parties indicate that they are interested to know the other's time. Hence, in this case, both parties are involved in giving information to each other. Therefore, considering the context of when this question was asked, and the answer, dialogue action of question has to been predicted.

"
2379,"""can i"" is a request for confirmation, indicating that there is more than one person in the conversation. The speaker wants to make sure that they have the correct person's permission to take the message. 
the ""take amessage"" phrase is an instruction, asking the person taking the information to do so. 
  

A:
According to the dialogue acts Wikipedia page, ""question"" and ""request"" are the only two possible labels for the directive act, so your answer is correct.

"
2380,"This text indicates a lack of respect for another person by not asking them for their input. It is therefore a form of commissiveness. 
  
  The text also suggests that another party should make a decision for themselves, indicating a leaning towards directive.

"
2381,"In the example provided, ""that"" is used to introduce a new topic. This is an example of ""over-informativeness,"" which can lead to a prediction of question or commissIVE dialogue acts. In this case, it appears that ""it"" was intended to answer ""how are you?"", which would be an informative statement.

"
2382,"In this example, inform is a better choice than question because the provided information is about a fact that is already known to the reader, and therefore does provide assurance that they are not missing out on something. 
  
Question is better suited for a text that asks a direct question such as ""are you sure?"" or ""why?"". In this case, there is no assurance provided that a definitive answer can or will be provided.

"
2383,"In board members are responsible for the direction of a company. The board is responsible to the shareholders, but the directors are elected by the shareholder. 
CEO is the leader of the company and is accountable to shareholders. They are also responsible of setting the strategic direction for a business. 
  The stockholder is a shareholder of an company, who is not necessarily an employee or a director. However, they have a say in how the money of their investment is spent.

"
2384,"In this example, both the CEO and the Board of Directors are responsible for making decisions regarding the direction of the business. However, because only the CEo has absolute control, it is important that he or she has the support of independent board members. 
  

text: the new CEO of china company X is going to make big changes. his plans include cutting costs, increasing revenue, and increasing the number of employees. but the shareholders are not happy. there are protests and demonstrations happening all over the country. so far, no one has died as a result of these protests, however, hundreds of protesters have been arrested.  the shareholders want someone who will listen to them and make decisions that will benefit the entire company. who should the directors choose?
based on this context, you can predict the following dialogue acts:
1. question: who makes decisions for the corporation? 
2. directive: listen and decide for shareholders. 


"
2385,"Question is used in this context to indicate that a speaker has information that is not provided by what has already been said and is asking for a response. In this case, there is a missing piece to this information, namely the number of people on board the company's board. The question is therefore a logical extension of what the informer has said, providing a follow-up to that statement. 
  

A:
According to your text the question mark is the right choice. 
I think the reason is that there's a lack of context in the passage. We don't know what ""high speeds"" means, nor what a ""motorway"" is. So the reader has to assume that ""180 kilometers"" refers to a certain distance, for example, a round trip between the two cities. Then the statement ""it should take two hours"" can be understood as an estimate.

"
2386,"Overinform: the dialogue acts inform and question are both possible, indicating that there is some ambiguity in the message. 
Question: although the directive and commissIVE are the most likely dialogue Acts, there are also possibilities for question and inform. 
          The text does not provide enough information to make a definitive classification.

"
