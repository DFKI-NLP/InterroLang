0,"Question: does ethanol take more energy make that produces
Passage: Ethanol fuel -- All biomass goes through at least some of these steps: it needs to be grown, collected, dried, fermented, distilled, and burned. All of these steps require resources and an infrastructure. The total amount of energy input into the process compared to the energy released by burning the resulting ethanol fuel is known as the energy balance (or ``energy returned on energy invested''). Figures compiled in a 2007 report by National Geographic Magazine point to modest results for corn ethanol produced in the US: one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 1.3 energy units from the resulting ethanol. The energy balance for sugarcane ethanol produced in Brazil is more favorable, with one unit of fossil-fuel energy required to create 8 from the ethanol. Energy balance estimates are not easily produced, thus numerous such reports have been generated that are contradictory. For instance, a separate survey reports that production of ethanol from sugarcane, which requires a tropical climate to grow productively, returns from 8 to 9 units of energy for each unit expended, as compared to corn, which only returns about 1.34 units of fuel energy for each unit of energy expended. A 2006 University of California Berkeley study, after analyzing six separate studies, concluded that producing ethanol from corn uses much less petroleum than producing gasoline.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage states that the energy balance of ethanol production varies depending on the type of biomass used and the location where it is grown. It also mentions that producing ethanol from corn in the US requires one unit of fossil-fuel energy to create only 1.3 energy units from the resulting ethanol, indicating that it takes more energy to produce ethanol than it actually generates. Therefore, it can be inferred that ethanol production may take more energy to make than it produces."
1,"Question: is house tax and property tax are same
Passage: Property tax -- Property tax or 'house tax' is a local tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is and imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property as per 1978, 44th amendment of constitution). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from the excise-type UK rate. The tax power is vested in the states and is delegated to local bodies, specifying the valuation method, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied and other properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Vacant land is generally exempt. Central government properties are exempt. Instead a 'service charge' is permissible under executive order. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity. The tax is usually accompanied by service taxes, e.g., water tax, drainage tax, conservancy (sanitation) tax, lighting tax, all using the same tax base. The rate structure is flat on rural (panchayat) properties, but in the urban (municipal) areas it is mildly progressive with about 80% of assessments falling in the first two brackets.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","House tax and property tax are the same because the passage defines property tax as a local tax on buildings and appurtenant land, which is imposed on the possessor of the property. It goes on to explain that properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into annual rental value, and that the tax is usually accompanied by service taxes such as water tax and drainage tax. Therefore, it can be inferred that house tax and property tax refer to the same tax on buildings and land."

6,"Question: can an odd number be divided by an even number
Passage: Parity (mathematics) -- In mathematics, parity is the property of an integer's inclusion in one of two categories: even or odd. An integer is even if it is evenly divisible by two and odd if it is not even. For example, 6 is even because there is no remainder when dividing it by 2. By contrast, 3, 5, 7, 21 leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. Examples of even numbers include −4, 0, 82 and 178. In particular, zero is an even number. Some examples of odd numbers are −5, 3, 29, and 73.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","An integer is even if it is evenly divisible by two.

21,"Question: does a spark plug keep an engine running
Passage: Spark plug -- A spark plug (sometimes, in British English, a sparking plug, and, colloquially, a plug) is a device for delivering electric current from an ignition system to the combustion chamber of a spark-ignition engine to ignite the compressed fuel/air mixture by an electric spark, while containing combustion pressure within the engine. A spark plug has a metal threaded shell, electrically isolated from a central electrode by a porcelain insulator. The central electrode, which may contain a resistor, is connected by a heavily insulated wire to the output terminal of an ignition coil or magneto. The spark plug's metal shell is screwed into the engine's cylinder head and thus electrically grounded. The central electrode protrudes through the porcelain insulator into the combustion chamber, forming one or more spark gaps between the inner end of the central electrode and usually one or more protuberances or structures attached to the inner end of the threaded shell and designated the side, earth, or ground electrode(s).
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","A spark plug is responsible for igniting the compressed fuel/air mixture in a spark-ignition engine by creating an electric spark.

27,"Question: do you need to break in a car
Passage: Break-in (mechanical run-in) -- A new engine is broken in by following specific driving guidelines during the first few hours of its use. The focus of breaking in an engine is on the contact between the piston rings of the engine and the cylinder wall. There is no universal preparation or set of instructions for breaking in an engine. Most importantly, experts disagree on whether it is better to start engines on high or low power to break them in. While there are still consequences to an unsuccessful break-in, they are harder to quantify on modern engines than on older models. In general, people no longer break in the engines of their own vehicles after purchasing a car or motorcycle, because the process is done in production. It is still common, even today, to find that an owner's manual recommends gentle use at first (often specified as the first 500 or 1000 kilometres or miles). But it is usually only normal use without excessive demands that is specified, as opposed to light/limited use. For example, the manual will specify that the car be driven normally, but not in excess of the highway speed limit.
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage explains the concept of breaking in a new engine and how it is done to ensure proper functioning of the engine. It also mentions that while it used to be common practice for car owners to break in their engines, it is now mostly done during production. Therefore, the answer is false as breaking in a car is not necessary for most modern engines."

Passage: Cover version -- Since the Copyright Act of 1909, United States musicians have had the right to record a version of someone else's previously recorded and released tune, whether it is music alone or music with lyrics. A license can be negotiated between representatives of the interpreting artist and the copyright holder, or recording published tunes can fall under a mechanical license whereby the recording artist pays a standard royalty to the original author/copyright holder through an organization such as the Harry Fox Agency, and is safe under copyright law even if they do not have any permission from the original author. A similar service was provided by Limelight by RightsFlow, until January 2015, when they announced they will be closing their service.

38,"Question: can carbon form polar covalent bonds with hydrogen
Passage: Carbon–hydrogen bond -- The carbon-hydrogen bond (C--H bond) is a bond between carbon and hydrogen atoms that can be found in many organic compounds. This bond is a covalent bond meaning that carbon shares its outer valence electrons with up to four hydrogens. This completes both of their outer shells making them stable. Carbon--hydrogen bonds have a bond length of about 1.09 Å (1.09 × 10 m) and a bond energy of about 413 kJ/mol (see table below). Using Pauling's scale--C (2.55) and H (2.2)--the electronegativity difference between these two atoms is 0.35. Because of this small difference in electronegativities, the C−H bond is generally regarded as being non-polar. In structural formulas of molecules, the hydrogen atoms are often omitted. Compound classes consisting solely of C--H bonds and C--C bonds are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Collectively they are known as hydrocarbons.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage explains that the carbon-hydrogen bond is a covalent bond, meaning that the electrons are shared between the two atoms.

Passage: Fox hunting -- Fox hunting with hounds, as a formalised activity, originated in England in the sixteenth century, in a form very similar to that practised until February 2005, when a law banning the activity in England and Wales came into force. A ban on hunting in Scotland had been passed in 2002, but it continues to be within the law in Northern Ireland and several other countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Ireland and the United States. In Australia, the term also refers to the hunting of foxes with firearms, similar to deer hunting. In much of the world, hunting in general is understood to relate to any game animals or weapons (e.g., deer hunting with bow and arrow); in Britain and Ireland, ``hunting'' without qualification implies fox hunting (or other forms of hunting with hounds--beagling, drag hunting, hunting the clean boot, mink hunting, or stag hunting), as described here.

55,"Question: does damon and elena get together in season 3
Passage: Damon Salvatore -- In the third season, Damon helps Elena in bringing his brother, Stefan, back to Mystic Falls after Stefan becomes Klaus' henchman. The arrangement transpired after a bargain for his blood that would cure Damon of the werewolf bite he had received from Tyler. At first, he is reluctant to involve Elena in the rescue attempts, employing Alaric Saltzman, Elena's guardian, instead as Klaus does not know that Elena is alive after the sacrifice which frees Klaus' hybrid side. However, Elena involves herself, desperate to find Stefan. Damon, though hesitant at first, is unable to refuse her because of his love for her. He also points out to her that she once turned back from finding Stefan since she knew Damon would be in danger, clearly showing that she also has feelings for him. He tells her that ``when (he) drag(s) (his) brother from the edge to deliver him back to (her), (he) wants her to remember the things (she) felt while he was gone.'' When Stefan finally returns to Mystic Falls, his attitude is different from that of the first and second seasons. This causes a rift between Elena and Stefan whereas the relationship between Damon and Elena becomes closer and more intimate. A still loyal Elena, however, refuses to admit her feelings for Damon. In 'Dangerous Liaisons', Elena, frustrated with her feelings for him, tells Damon that his love for her may be a problem, and that this could be causing all their troubles. This incenses Damon, causing him to revert to the uncaring and reckless Damon seen in the previous seasons. The rocky relationship between the two continues until the sexual tension hits the fan and in a moment of heated passion, Elena -- for the first time in the three seasons -- kisses Damon of her own accord. This kiss finally causes Elena to admit that she loves both brothers and realize that she must ultimately make her choice as her own ancestress, Katherine Pierce, who turned the brothers, once did. In assessment of her feelings for Damon, she states this: ``Damon just sort of snuck up on me. He got under my skin and no matter what I do, I can't shake him.'' In the season finale, a trip designed to get her to safety forces Elena to make her choice: to go to Damon and possibly see him one last time; or to go to Stefan and her friends and see them one last time. She chooses the latter when she calls Damon to tell him her decision. Damon, who is trying to stop Alaric, accepts what she says and she tells him that maybe if she had met Damon before she had met Stefan, her choice may have been different. This statement causes Damon to remember the first night he did meet Elena which was, in fact, the night her parents died - before she had met Stefan. Not wanting anyone to know he was in town and after giving her some advice about life and love, Damon compels her to forget. He remembers this as he fights Alaric and seems accepting of his death when Alaric, whose life line is tied to Elena's, suddenly collapses in his arms. Damon is grief-stricken, knowing that this means that Elena has also died and yells, ``No! You are not dead!'' A heartbroken Damon then goes to the hospital demanding to see Elena when the doctor, Meredith Fell, tells him that she gave Elena vampire blood. The last shot of the season finale episode shows Elena in transition.

Passage: Possession and acquisition licence -- A possession and acquisition licence is a licence that allows individuals in Canada to possess and acquire firearms as well as ammunition. Licences are typically valid for five years and must be renewed prior to expiry to maintain all classes. If an individual possessing a PAL is convicted of certain offences, a PAL can be revoked. If an individual does not renew their PAL prior to its expiration date or if they have their PAL revoked, they must legally dispose of any firearms in their possession. A licence for prohibited firearms can be issued to qualifying businesses, and very rarely to individuals (firearms they own, as the gun laws changed over time.) Previous convictions for serious violent, drug or weapons offences almost invariably result in the denial of the application.
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage explicitly states that a possession and acquisition licence allows individuals to possess and acquire both firearms and ammunition.

75,"Question: do female ferrets die if they don't mate
Passage: Ferret health -- Males, if not neutered, are extremely musky. It is considered preferable to delay neutering until sexual maturity has been reached, at approximately six to eight months old, after the full descent of the testicles. Neutering the male will reduce the smell to almost nothing. The same applies for females, but spaying them is also important for their own health. Unless they are going to be used for breeding purposes, female ferrets will go into extended heat. A female that does not mate can die of aplastic anemia without medical intervention. It is possible to use a vasectomised male to take a female out of heat.

82,"Question: is there a tiebreaker in final set at wimbledon
Passage: Tennis scoring system -- The tiebreak is sometimes not employed for the final set of a match and an advantage set is used instead. Therefore, the deciding set must be played until one player or team has won two more games than the opponent. This is true in three of the four major tennis championships, all except the US Open where a tiebreak is played even in the deciding set (fifth set for the men, third set for the women) at 6--6. A tiebreak is not played in the deciding set in the other three majors -- the Australian Open, the French Open, and Wimbledon. (When the tiebreak was first introduced at Wimbledon in 1971, it was invoked at 8--8 rather than 6--6.) The US Open holds ``Super Saturday'' where the two men's semi-finals are played along with the women's final on the second Saturday of the event; therefore a tie-break is more prudent where player rest and scheduling is more important.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage states that a tiebreak is not played in the deciding set at Wimbledon, and instead an advantage set is used where the players must win by two games.

96,"Question: can someone die from a bullet shot in the air
Passage: Celebratory gunfire -- Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage explains that celebratory gunfire can be dangerous and even fatal because bullets fired into the air can fall back down to the ground at velocities that can still cause harm.

Her parents file a lawsuit against the genetics company InGen, now headed by John Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow, who plans to use Isla Sorna to alleviate the financial losses imposed by the incident that occurred at Jurassic Park four years earlier. Mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm meets Hammond at his mansion. Hammond explains that Isla Sorna, abandoned years earlier during a hurricane, is where InGen created their dinosaurs before moving them to Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar. Hammond hopes to stop InGen by sending a team to Isla Sorna to document the dinosaurs, thus causing public support against human interference on the island.

100,"Question: can you have too much oxygen in your body
Passage: Oxygen toxicity -- The result of breathing increased partial pressures of oxygen is hyperoxia, an excess of oxygen in body tissues. The body is affected in different ways depending on the type of exposure. Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure to increased oxygen levels at normal pressure. Symptoms may include disorientation, breathing problems, and vision changes such as myopia. Prolonged exposure to above-normal oxygen partial pressures, or shorter exposures to very high partial pressures, can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, retinal detachment, and seizures. Oxygen toxicity is managed by reducing the exposure to increased oxygen levels. Studies show that, in the long term, a robust recovery from most types of oxygen toxicity is possible.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage explains that prolonged exposure to above-normal oxygen partial pressures or shorter exposures to very high partial pressures can cause various types of toxicity and damage to the body, including oxidative damage to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, retinal detachment, and seizures.

Passage: 1921 Tampa Bay hurricane -- The storm brought strong winds to the Swan Islands, including hurricane-force winds on the main island. Heavy rains fell in Cuba, particularly in Pinar del Río Province, but only minor damage occurred. In Florida, storm surge and abnormally high tides caused damage along much of the state's west coast from Pasco County southward. Several neighborhoods and sections of Tampa were inundated, especially in Ballast Point, DeSoto Park, Edgewater Park, Hyde Park, Palmetto Beach, and other areas in the vicinity of Bayshore Boulevard. Strong winds also damaged hundreds of trees, signs, buildings, and homes. Four deaths occurred in Tampa, three from drownings and another after a man touched a live wire. The storm left two additional fatalities in St. Petersburg. A number of streets in Tarpon Springs were littered with masses of debris, with many structures and trees suffering extensive damage. Strong winds occurred as far east as the Atlantic coast of the state, though wind damage east of the Tampa Bay area was generally limited to downed trees and power lines, resulting in power outages, particularly in Orlando. Agriculture throughout the state experienced significant impact as well, including over $2 million (equivalent to $20 million in 2016) in damage and the loss of at least 800,000 boxes of citrus crops alone. Overall, the hurricane left at least eight deaths and about $10 million (equivalent to $110 million in 2016) in damage.

103,"Question: can anyone give last rites in an emergency
Passage: Anointing of the Sick in the Catholic Church -- The Catholic Church sees the effects of the sacrament as follows: As the sacrament of Marriage gives grace for the married state, the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick gives grace for the state into which people enter through sickness. Through the sacrament a gift of the Holy Spirit is given, that renews confidence and faith in God and strengthens against temptations to discouragement, despair and anguish at the thought of death and the struggle of death; it prevents the believer from losing Christian hope in God's justice, truth and salvation. Because one of the effects of the sacrament is to absolve the recipient of any sins not previously absolved through the sacrament of penance, only an ordained priest or bishop may administer the sacrament.

The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act. It was the country's first peacetime draft. From 1940 until 1973, during both peacetime and periods of conflict, men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means. The draft came to an end when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military force. However, the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed. United States Federal Law also provides for the compulsory conscription of men between the ages of 17 and 45 and certain women for militia service pursuant to Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution and 10 U.S. Code § 246.

Passage: Vehicle title -- In the United Kingdom, there is not an equivalent of a vehicle title. Instead, there is a document known as the 'vehicle registration document', and is issued by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). The current version has the reference number V5C. Prior to computerisation, the title document was the 'log book', and this term is sometimes still used to describe the V5C. The V5 document records who the Registered Keeper of the vehicle is; it does not establish legal ownership of the vehicle. These documents used to be blue on the front. However, they were changed to red in 2010/11 after approximately 2.2 million blank blue V5 documents were stolen, allowing thieves to clone stolen vehicles much more easily.

120,"Question: are st bernards and bernese mountain dogs related
Passage: St. Bernard (dog) -- The breed is strikingly similar to the English Mastiff, with which it shares a common ancestor known as the Alpine Mastiff. The modern St. Bernard breed is radically different than the original dogs kept at the St. Bernard hospice, most notably by being much larger in size and build. Since the late 1800s, the St. Bernard breed has been ever refined and improved using many different large Molosser breeds, including the Newfoundland, Great Pyrenees, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, Bernese Mountain Dog, Great Dane, English Mastiff, and possibly the Tibetan Mastiff and Caucasian Ovcharka. Other breeds such as the Rottweiler, Boxer, and English Bulldog may have contributed to the St. Bernard's bloodline as well. It is suspected that many of these large breeds were used to redevelop each other to combat the threat of their extinction after World War II, which may explain why all of them played a part in the creation of the St. Bernard as seen today.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage states that the St. Bernard breed has been improved using many different large Molosser breeds, including the Bernese Mountain Dog, among others.

Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage mentions that some inhabitants of Pompeii moved to other cities within the Roman Empire while others remained and rebuilt. This suggests that there were survivors of the eruption. However, the passage does not provide a specific number or percentage of survivors."
125,"Question: can one travel faster than the speed of light
Passage: Faster-than-light -- According to the current scientific theories, matter is required to travel at slower-than-light (also subluminal or STL) speed with respect to the locally distorted spacetime region. Apparent FTL is not excluded by general relativity; however, any apparent FTL physical plausibility is speculative. Examples of apparent FTL proposals are the Alcubierre drive and the traversable wormhole.

Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage states that the Republic of Ireland advanced to the play-offs as one of the best 8 runners-up, but it does not explicitly state whether or not they ultimately qualified for the 2018 World Cup. Therefore, the answer to the question of whether or not Ireland qualified cannot be determined solely from the passage."
128,"Question: can you sell a gun privately in florida
Passage: Gun laws in Florida -- As state law on waiting periods and background checks do not apply to sales by non-licensed sellers, the Florida Constitution, Art VIII Sec. 5(b), permits counties to enact ordinances that require a criminal history records check and a 3 to 5-day waiting period for non-licensed sellers when any part of a firearm sale is conducted on property to which the public has the ``right of access'', such as at a gun show conducted on public property. These local option ordinances may not be applied to holders of a concealed weapons license. Only Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, Hillsborough, and Volusia counties had enacted such ordinances.

As Creasy drives off with the kidnappers, it is implied that Creasy, at peace with himself, succumbs to his wounds and dies. Daniel Sánchez is later shot and killed by Manzano during an AFI arrest raid.

130,"Question: does latent heat of vaporization change with temperature
Passage: Enthalpy of vaporization -- The heat of vaporization is temperature-dependent, though a constant heat of vaporization can be assumed for small temperature ranges and for reduced temperature T r (\displaystyle T_(r)) ≪ 1 (\displaystyle \ll 1) . The heat of vaporization diminishes with increasing temperature and it vanishes completely at a certain point called the critical temperature ( T r = 1 (\displaystyle T_(r)=1) ). Above the critical temperature, the liquid and vapor phases are indistinguishable, and the substance is called a supercritical fluid.
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage clearly states that the heat of vaporization is temperature-dependent and diminishes with increasing temperature. This means that the latent heat of vaporization does change with temperature, which contradicts the statement in the question that it does not."
131,"Question: can a nas be used as a server
Passage: Network-attached storage -- Network-attached storage (NAS) is a file-level computer data storage server connected to a computer network providing data access to a heterogeneous group of clients. NAS is specialized for serving files either by its hardware, software, or configuration. It is often manufactured as a computer appliance -- a purpose-built specialized computer. NAS systems are networked appliances which contain one or more storage drives, often arranged into logical, redundant storage containers or RAID. Network-attached storage removes the responsibility of file serving from other servers on the network. They typically provide access to files using network file sharing protocols such as NFS, SMB/CIFS, or AFP. From the mid-1990s, NAS devices began gaining popularity as a convenient method of sharing files among multiple computers. Potential benefits of dedicated network-attached storage, compared to general-purpose servers also serving files, include faster data access, easier administration, and simple configuration.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage defines network-attached storage (NAS) as a specialized computer data storage server that is connected to a computer network and provides data access to clients.

132,"Question: did my name is earl finish his list
Passage: My Name Is Earl -- I had always had an ending to Earl and I'm sorry I didn't get the chance to see it happen. You've got a show about a guy with a list so not seeing him finish it is a bummer. But the truth is, he wasn't ever going to finish the list. The basic idea of the ending was that while he was stuck on a really hard list item he was going to start to get frustrated that he was never going to finish it. Then he runs into someone who had a list of their own and Earl was on it. They needed to make up for something bad they had done to Earl. He asks them where they got the idea of making a list and they tell him that someone came to them with a list and that person got the idea from someone else. Earl eventually realizes that his list started a chain reaction of people with lists and that he's finally put more good into the world than bad. So at that point he was going to tear up his list and go live his life. Walk into the sunset a free man. With good karma. --Greg Garcia
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ",The passage explains the planned ending for My Name Is Earl and reveals that the main character was not going to finish his list.
133,"Question: do powerball matches have to be in order
Passage: Powerball -- The minimum Powerball bet is $2. In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal pseudorandomly select the numbers (called ``quick pick'', ``easy pick'', etc.).
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage explicitly states that ""the drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant"" and that ""all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order."" This means that the order in which the five white balls are drawn does not matter and that they will always be displayed in ascending order on the ticket. Therefore, powerball matches do not have to be in order."
134,"Question: is fate and the furious the last movie
Passage: The Fate of the Furious -- The Fate of the Furious premiered in Berlin on April 4, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States on April 14, 2017, playing in 3D, IMAX 3D and 4DX internationally. The film received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom praised the action sequences and acting performances but criticized the storyline. The film grossed over $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the thirtieth film (and the second in the franchise, after Furious 7) to gross over $1 billion, the third-highest-grossing film of 2017 and the fifteenth-highest-grossing film of all time. The film grossed $542 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which is the second highest-grossing worldwide opening of all time behind Avengers: Infinity War (2018). A spinoff film starring Johnson and Statham's characters is scheduled for release in August 2019, while the ninth and tenth films are scheduled for releases on the years 2020 and 2021.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage mentions that a spinoff film starring two characters from the franchise is scheduled for release in August 2019, while the ninth and tenth films are scheduled for releases in 2020 and 2021. This suggests that Fate of the Furious is not the last movie in the series."

136,"Question: was the sears tower the tallest building in the world
Passage: Willis Tower -- The Willis Tower, built as and still commonly referred to as the Sears Tower, is a 110-story, 1,450-foot (442.1 m) skyscraper in Chicago, Illinois. At completion in 1973, it surpassed the World Trade Center towers in New York to become the tallest building in the world, a title it held for nearly 25 years; it remained the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere until the completion of a new building at the World Trade Center site in 2014. The building is considered a seminal achievement for its designer Fazlur Rahman Khan. The Willis Tower is the second-tallest building in the United States and the Western hemisphere -- and the 16th-tallest in the world. More than one million people visit its observation deck each year, making it one of Chicago's most-popular tourist destinations. The structure was renamed in 2009 by the Willis Group as part of its lease on a portion of the tower's space.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage states that at completion in 1973, the Willis Tower (formerly known as the Sears Tower) surpassed the World Trade Center towers in New York to become the tallest building in the world. It held this title for nearly 25 years, until a new building was completed at the World Trade Center site in 2014. Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, the answer to the question is true."
137,"Question: is the drinking age different in every state
Passage: U.S. history of alcohol minimum purchase age by state -- From 1976 to 1983, several states voluntarily raised their purchase ages to 19 (or, less commonly, 20 or 21), in part to combat drunk driving fatalities. In 1984, Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which required states to raise their ages for purchase and public possession to 21 by October 1986 or lose 10% of their federal highway funds. By mid-1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had raised their purchase ages to 21 (but not Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, see Additional Notes below). South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate. The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans, because of it being higher than the age of majority (18 in most states) and higher than the drinking ages of most other countries. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act is also seen as a congressional sidestep of the tenth amendment. Although debates have not been highly publicized, a few states have proposed legislation to lower their drinking age, while Guam has raised its drinking age to 21 in July 2010.
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage clearly states that in 1984, Congress passed a law requiring all states to raise their drinking age to 21 by 1986 or risk losing federal highway funds. By 1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had complied with this law. Therefore, the drinking age is not different in every state."
138,"Question: is it possible to have no sense of smell
Passage: Anosmia -- Anosmia is the inability to perceive odor or a lack of functioning olfaction--the loss of the sense of smell. Anosmia may be temporary, but some forms such as from an accident, can be permanent. Anosmia is due to a number of factors, including an inflammation of the nasal mucosa, blockage of nasal passages or a destruction of one temporal lobe. Inflammation is due to chronic mucosa changes in the paranasal sinus lining and the middle and superior turbinates.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage defines anosmia as the inability to perceive odor or a lack of functioning olfaction, which means that someone with anosmia cannot smell anything. Therefore, it is possible to have no sense of smell."
139,"Question: is the port mann bridge a toll bridge
Passage: Port Mann Bridge -- In order to recover construction and operating costs, the bridge was electronically tolled when originally built. The toll rates increased to $1.60 for motorcycle, $3.15 for cars, $6.30 for small trucks and $9.45 for large trucks on August 15, 2015. Through increased prices and greater traffic, Transportation Investment Corporation (TI Corp), the public Crown corporation responsible for toll operations on the Port Mann Bridge, forecast its revenue would grow by 85% between fiscal years 2014 and 2017. These fees were assessed using radio-frequency identification (RFID) decals or licence plate photos. A B.C. licensed driver who owes more than $25 in tolls outstanding 90 days is penalized $20 and is unable to purchase vehicle insurance or renew drivers permits without payment of the debt. Out-of-province drivers were also contacted for payment by a US-based contractor. A licence plate processing fee of $2.30 per trip was added to the toll rate for unregistered users who did not pay their toll within seven days of their passage. Monthly passes, which allowed unlimited crossing on the bridge, were available for purchase. Users may have set up an account for online payment of tolls. Users who opted for this method received a decal with an embedded RFID to place on their vehicle's windshield or headlight and avoid paying a processing fee. Tolls were expected to be removed by the year of 2050 or after collecting $3.3 billion. As announced by B.C. Premier John Horgan a few days earlier, all tolls on the Port Mann Bridge were removed on September 1, 2017. Debt service was transferred to the province of British Columbia at a cost of $135 million per year.
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage explicitly states that the Port Mann Bridge was tolled when originally built, and provides information about the toll rates and methods of payment. However, it also states that all tolls on the bridge were removed on September 1, 2017, as announced by the B.C. Premier. Therefore, the answer to the question is false, as the Port Mann Bridge is no longer a toll bridge."
140,"Question: can the fa cup final end in a tie
Passage: FA Cup -- The first FA Cup Final to go to extra time and a replay was the 1875 final, between the Royal Engineers and the Old Etonians. The initial tie finished 1--1 but the Royal Engineers won the replay 2--0 in normal time. The last replayed final was the 1993 FA Cup Final, when Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday fought a 1--1 draw. The replay saw Arsenal win the FA Cup, 2--1 after extra time.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage mentions that there have been replays in previous FA Cup Finals, indicating that a tie is possible in the final."
141,"Question: is denatured alcohol and acetone the same thing
Passage: Denatured alcohol -- Denatured alcohol is used as a solvent and as fuel for alcohol burners and camping stoves. Because of the diversity of industrial uses for denatured alcohol, hundreds of additives and denaturing methods have been used. The main additive has traditionally been 10% methanol, giving rise to the term ``methylated spirits''. Other typical additives include isopropyl alcohol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, and denatonium.
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage mentions both denatured alcohol and acetone as additives, but it does not state that they are the same thing. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be assumed that denatured alcohol and acetone are the same thing."
142,"Question: is the dot product of two vectors a scalar
Passage: Dot product -- In mathematics, the dot product or scalar product is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually coordinate vectors) and returns a single number. In Euclidean geometry, the dot product of the Cartesian coordinates of two vectors is widely used and often called inner product (or rarely projection product); see also inner product space.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage defines the dot product as an operation that takes two vectors and returns a single number. It also mentions that the dot product is sometimes called the inner product, which implies that the result is a scalar. Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, it can be concluded that the dot product of two vectors is indeed a scalar."
143,"Question: is there such thing as a dominant eye
Passage: Ocular dominance -- Ocular dominance, sometimes called eye preference or eyedness, is the tendency to prefer visual input from one eye to the other. It is somewhat analogous to the laterality of right- or left-handedness; however, the side of the dominant eye and the dominant hand do not always match. This is because both hemispheres control both eyes, but each one takes charge of a different half of the field of vision, and therefore a different half of both retinas (See Optic Tract for more details). There is thus no direct analogy between ``handedness'' and ``eyedness'' as lateral phenomena.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage explains that ocular dominance, also known as eye preference or eyedness, is a real phenomenon. It is the tendency to favor visual input from one eye over the other, and it is not always the same as hand dominance. The passage provides further details on how each hemisphere controls different halves of the field of vision and both retinas, which explains why there is no direct analogy between handedness and eyedness. Therefore, the statement that there is such a thing as a dominant eye is true based on the information provided in the passage."
144,"Question: is the isle of man part of the european economic area
Passage: External relations of the Isle of Man -- The Isle of Man holds neither membership nor associate membership of the European Union, and lies outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Nonetheless, Protocol 3 permits trade in Manx goods without non-EU tariffs. In conjunction with the Customs and Excise agreement with the UK, this facilitates free trade with the UK. While Manx goods can be freely moved within the EEA, people, capital and services cannot.
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage clearly states that the Isle of Man is outside the European Economic Area (EEA), which means it is not a part of it."

146,"Question: is navel and belly button the same thing
Passage: Navel -- The navel (clinically known as the umbilicus, colloquially known as the belly button, or tummy button) is a hollowed or sometimes raised area on the abdomen at the attachment site of the umbilical cord. All placental mammals have a navel.
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage defines the term ""navel"" as a hollowed or raised area on the abdomen where the umbilical cord was attached, and notes that it is also colloquially known as the ""belly button"" or ""tummy button."" Therefore, it can be inferred that these terms are interchangeable and refer to the same thing."
147,"Question: does smeagol die in lord of the rings
Passage: Gollum -- The Ring, which Gollum referred to as ``my precious'' or ``precious'', extended his life far beyond natural limits. Centuries of the Ring's influence twisted Gollum's body and mind, and, by the time of the novels, he ``loved and hated (the Ring), just as he loved and hated himself.'' Throughout the story, Gollum was torn between his lust for the Ring and his desire to be free of it. Bilbo Baggins found the Ring and took it for his own, and Gollum afterwards pursued it for the rest of his life. Gollum finally seized the Ring from Frodo Baggins at the Cracks of Doom in Orodruin in Mordor; but he fell into the fires of the volcano, where both he and the Ring were destroyed.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","It is possible that Smeagol dies in Lord of the Rings based on the passage, as it describes the fate of a character named Gollum who is heavily associated with the Ring and has a similar physical appearance to Smeagol. The passage states that Gollum falls into the fires of a volcano along with the Ring, leading to their destruction. However, it does not explicitly state whether or not Smeagol is the same character as Gollum or if he meets the same fate."

149,"Question: does majora's mask have a time limit
Passage: The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask -- Majora's Mask imposes a time limit of three days (72 hours) game-time, which is about 54 minutes in real time. An on-screen clock tracks the day and time. Link can return to 6:00 am on the first day by playing the ``Song of Time'' on the Ocarina of Time. If he does not before the 72 hours expire, then the moon will destroy Clock Town, including all the surrounding regions of Termina and Link will lose everything he accomplished during these three days. A real-time countdown will begin when only 6 hours remain. However, returning to the first day saves the player's progress and major accomplishments permanently, such as the acquisition of maps, masks, musical tracks, and weapons. Cleared puzzles, keys, and minor items will be lost, as well as any rupees not in the bank, and almost all characters will have no recollection of meeting Link. Link can slow down time or warp to the next morning or evening by playing two variations of the Song of Time. Owl statues scattered across certain major areas of the world allow the player to temporarily save their progress once they have been activated, and also provide warp points to quickly move around the world.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage clearly states that Majora's Mask imposes a time limit of three days (72 hours) game-time and that there is an on-screen clock tracking the day and time. It also explains that if the player does not return to the first day before the 72 hours expire, then they will lose everything they accomplished during these three days.

155,"Question: is hindi is our national language of india
Passage: Languages with official status in India -- The Constitution of India designates the official language of the Government of India as Hindi written in the Devanagari script, as well as English. There is no national language as declared by the Constitution of India. Hindi is used for official purposes such as parliamentary proceedings, judiciary, communications between the Central Government and a State Government. States within India have the liberty and powers to specify their own official language(s) through legislation and therefore there are 22 officially recognized languages in India of which Hindi is the most used. The number of native Hindi speakers is about 25% of the total Indian population; however, including dialects of Hindi termed as Hindi languages, the total is around 44% of Indians, mostly accounted from the states falling under the Hindi belt. Other Indian languages are each spoken by around 10% or less of the population.

157,"Question: is there going to be a season 3 for daredevil
Passage: Daredevil (season 3) -- At San Diego Comic-Con International 2016, Marvel and Netflix revealed the series had been renewed for a third season, with the expectation that Doug Petrie and Marco Ramirez would return as showrunners from the second season. In October 2017, it was announced that Erik Oleson would replace Petrie and Ramirez as showrunner for the season. The season had yet to be scheduled for release by the end of July 2018, and television critics wondered whether the quality of the season was to blame on this. Netflix VP Cindy Holland responded that the scheduling of the various Marvel Netflix series, especially the crossover miniseries The Defenders which required cast members from all of the series to come together, was to blame for the delay, and that the company had no issue with the quality of the season; on the contrary, Holland described the season as ``fantastic'' and felt it was a ``real return to form'' for the series.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage provides clear evidence that Daredevil has been renewed for a third season, with new showrunners announced in 2017. Although the season had not been scheduled for release as of July 2018, this was attributed to scheduling issues rather than any concerns about the quality of the season. Therefore, it can be inferred that there will be a season 3 for Daredevil."
158,"Question: can a tree have more than one trunk
Passage: Tree measurement -- Trees have a wide variety of sizes and shapes and growth habits. Specimens may grow as individual trunks, multitrunk masses, coppices, clonal colonies, or even more exotic tree complexes. Most champion tree programs focus finding and measuring the largest single-trunk example of each species. There are three basic parameters commonly measured to characterize the size of a single trunk tree: height, girth, and crown spread. Additional details on the methodology of Tree height measurement, Tree girth measurement, Tree crown measurement, and Tree volume measurement are presented in the links herein. A detailed guideline to these basic measurements is provided in The Tree Measuring Guidelines of the Eastern Native Tree Society by Will Blozan.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage describes different growth habits of trees, including multitrunk masses and tree complexes.

163,"Question: is thread seal tape and teflon tape the same
Passage: Thread seal tape -- Thread seal tape (also known as PTFE tape or plumber's tape) is a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film tape commonly used in plumbing for sealing pipe threads. The tape is sold cut to specific widths and wound on a spool, making it easy to wind around pipe threads. It is also known by the genericized trademark Teflon tape; while Teflon is in fact identical to PTFE, Chemours (the trade-mark holders) consider this usage incorrect, especially as they no longer manufacture Teflon in tape form. Thread seal tape lubricates allowing for a deeper seating of the threads, and it helps prevent the threads from seizing when being unscrewed. The tape also works as a deformable filler and thread lubricant, helping to seal the joint without hardening or making it more difficult to tighten, and instead making it easier to tighten.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage defines thread seal tape as a type of tape used for sealing pipe threads in plumbing.

Passage: Bumblebee -- The chill-coma temperature in relation to flying insects is the temperature at which flight muscles cannot be activated. Compared to honey bees and carpenter bees, bumblebees have the lowest chill-coma temperature. Of the bumblebees Bombus bimaculatus has the lowest at 7 °C (45 °F).

The song was written by Survivor guitarist Frankie Sullivan and keyboardist Jim Peterik, and was recorded at the request of Rocky III star, writer, and director Sylvester Stallone, after Queen denied him permission to use ``Another One Bites the Dust'', the song Stallone intended as the Rocky III theme. Originally, the song was made for the movie The Karate Kid. The director of both Rocky and The Karate Kid planned to use the song for a fighting montage towards the end of the feature. John G.

178,"Question: does the us court of appeals have original jurisdiction
Passage: United States courts of appeals -- Because the courts of appeals possess only appellate jurisdiction, they do not hold trials. Only courts with original jurisdiction hold trials and thus determine punishments (in criminal cases) and remedies (in civil cases). Instead, appeals courts review decisions of trial courts for errors of law. Accordingly, an appeals court considers only the record (that is, the papers the parties filed and the transcripts and any exhibits from any trial) from the trial court, and the legal arguments of the parties. These arguments, which are presented in written form and can range in length from dozens to hundreds of pages, are known as briefs. Sometimes lawyers are permitted to add to their written briefs with oral arguments before the appeals judges. At such hearings, only the parties' lawyers speak to the court.
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage clearly states that courts of appeals do not have original jurisdiction, but only possess appellate jurisdiction. Therefore, the answer to the question is false."
179,"Question: do you win chess by taking the queen
Passage: Rules of chess -- If a player's king is placed in check and there is no legal move that player can make to escape check, then the king is said to be checkmated, the game ends, and that player loses (Schiller 2003:20--21).

Based on question and passage, the answer is false.

188,"Question: are there any states that do not have a seat belt law
Passage: Seat belt laws in the United States -- Most seat belt laws in the United States are left to the states. However, the first seat belt law was a federal law, Title 49 of the United States Code, Chapter 301, Motor Vehicle Safety Standard, which took effect on January 1, 1968, that required all vehicles (except buses) to be fitted with seat belts in all designated seating positions. This law has since been modified to require three-point seat belts in outboard-seating positions, and finally three-point seat belts in all seating positions. Initially, seat belt use was voluntary. New York was the first state to pass a law which required vehicle occupants to wear seat belts, a law that came into effect on December 1, 1984. Officer Nicholas Cimmino of the Westchester County Department of Public Safety wrote the nation's first ticket for such violation. New Hampshire is the only state that has no enforceable laws for the wearing of seat belts in a vehicle.
Based on question and passage, the answer is false.

189,"Question: do bees die if they lose their stinger
Passage: Bee sting -- Although it is widely believed that a worker honey bee can sting only once, this is a partial misconception: although the stinger is in fact barbed so that it lodges in the victim's skin, tearing loose from the bee's abdomen and leading to its death in minutes, this only happens if the skin of the victim is sufficiently thick, such as a mammal's. Honey bees are the only hymenoptera with a strongly barbed sting, though yellow jackets and some other wasps have small barbs.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage explains that a honey bee's stinger is barbed and can become lodged in the victim's skin, leading to the bee's death in minutes. However, this only happens if the skin of the victim is thick enough. Therefore, it is possible for a bee to lose its stinger and not die, but it depends on the thickness of the skin it stings."

194,"Question: do alligators drown their prey and eat it later
Passage: Alligator -- Although the alligator has a heavy body and a slow metabolism, it is capable of short bursts of speed, especially in very short lunges. Alligators' main prey are smaller animals they can kill and eat with a single bite. They may kill larger prey by grabbing it and dragging it into the water to drown. Alligators consume food that cannot be eaten in one bite by allowing it to rot, or by biting and then spinning or convulsing wildly until bite-sized chunks are torn off. This is referred to as a ``death roll''. Critical to the alligator's ability to initiate a death roll, the tail must flex to a significant angle relative to its body. An alligator with an immobilized tail cannot perform a death roll.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage states that alligators may kill larger prey by grabbing it and dragging it into the water to drown. It also mentions that alligators consume food that cannot be eaten in one bite by allowing it to rot, or by biting and then spinning or convulsing wildly until bite-sized chunks are torn off. This behavior is referred to as a ""death roll."" Therefore, it can be inferred that alligators may drown their prey and eat it later using the death roll technique."
195,"Question: has a t rex skull ever been found
Passage: Sue (dinosaur) -- During the summer of 1990, a group of workers from the Black Hills Institute, located in Hill City, searched for fossils at the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation in western South Dakota near the city of Faith. By the end of the summer, the group had discovered Edmontosaurus bones and was ready to leave. However, a flat tire was discovered on their truck before the group could depart on August 12. While the rest of the group went into town to repair the truck, Sue Hendrickson decided to explore the nearby cliffs that the group had not checked. As she was walking along the base of a cliff, she discovered some small pieces of bone. She looked above her to see where the bones had originated, and observed larger bones protruding from the wall of the cliff. She returned to camp with two small pieces of the bones and reported the discovery to the president of the Black Hills Institute, Peter Larson. He determined that the bones were from a T. rex by their distinctive contour and texture. Later, closer examination of the site showed many visible bones above the ground and some articulated vertebrae. The crew ordered extra plaster and, although some of the crew had to depart, Hendrickson and a few other workers began to uncover the bones. The group was excited, as it was evident that much of the dinosaur had been preserved. Previously discovered T. rex skeletons were usually missing over half of their bones. It was later determined that Sue was a record 90 percent complete by bulk, and 73% complete counting the elements. Scientists believe that this specimen was covered by water and mud soon after its death which prevented other animals from carrying away the bones. Additionally, the rushing water mixed the skeleton together. When the fossil was found the hip bones were above the skull and the leg bones were intertwined with the ribs. The large size and the excellent condition of the bones were also surprising. The skull was 1,394 mm (54.9 in) long, and most of the teeth were still intact. After the group completed excavating the bones, each block was covered in burlap and coated in plaster, followed by a transfer to the offices of The Black Hills Institute where they began to clean the bones.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage describes the discovery and excavation of a T. rex skeleton, including details about the skull, which was found to be 1,394 mm (54.9 in) long and mostly intact. Therefore, it can be inferred that a T. rex skull has been found."
196,"Question: are all the members of the band still alive
Passage: The Band -- The original configuration of the Band ended its touring career in 1976 with an elaborate live ballroom performance featuring numerous musical celebrities. This performance was filmed for Martin Scorsese's 1978 documentary The Last Waltz. The Band resumed touring in 1983 without guitarist Robertson, who had found success with a solo career and as a Hollywood music producer. Following a 1986 show, Manuel committed suicide. The remaining three members continued to tour and record albums with a succession of musicians filling Manuel's and Robertson's roles; the final configuration of the group included Richard Bell (piano), Randy Ciarlante (drums), and Jim Weider (guitar). Danko died of heart failure in 1999, after which the group broke up for good. Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998 and was unable to sing for several years, but he eventually regained the use of his voice. He continued to perform and released several successful albums until he died in 2012.
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage provides information about the members of The Band, including their touring history and the various musicians who filled in for certain members.

198,"Question: is antarctica the same as the south pole
Passage: South Pole -- Situated on the continent of Antarctica, it is the site of the United States Amundsen--Scott South Pole Station, which was established in 1956 and has been permanently staffed since that year. The Geographic South Pole is distinct from the South Magnetic Pole, the position of which is defined based on the Earth's magnetic field. The South Pole is at the center of the Southern Hemisphere.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage states that the South Pole is situated on the continent of Antarctica, which implies that they are not the same thing but rather related in some way.

199,"Question: do competitive inhibitors bind to the active site
Passage: Competitive inhibition -- Most competitive inhibitors function by binding reversibly to the active site of the enzyme. As a result, many sources state that this is the defining feature of competitive inhibitors. This, however, is a misleading oversimplification, as there are many possible mechanisms by which an enzyme may bind either the inhibitor or the substrate but never both at the same time. For example, allosteric inhibitors may display competitive, non-competitive, or uncompetitive inhibition.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage explicitly states that ""Most competitive inhibitors function by binding reversibly to the active site of the enzyme."" This indicates that competitive inhibitors do indeed bind to the active site."
200,"Question: has a woman ever played minor league baseball
Passage: Women in baseball -- There is evidence that at least one woman, Amanda Clement, was umpiring semi-professional games as early as 1905. ``Mandy,'' as she was called, grew up near a ballpark in her hometown of Hudson, South Dakota, where she was introduced to baseball by her brother Henry. Miss Clement began umpiring while a student at Yankton College, and gained fame nationwide for her knowledge of baseball and her accuracy in umpiring the games. She was paid between $10 and $15 per game, which helped pay her tuition. She umpired games in North Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota until at least 1909, and later became a physical education instructor for high school and college women's teams. She still would umpire an occasional semi-pro game in South Dakota even during the 1910s. There were several other woman umpires in the early 1920s: one was Mrs. Deana Ernest of Toledo, Ohio, who umpired semi-pro games in the area, and also managed a city league team there. Another was Nina Belle Hurst, a resident of Sawtelle, California, who umpired in the Southern California Baseball Managers Association. During World War II, there were also some women who umpired, including some the press jokingly referred to as ``WUMPS'' (women umpires). Among them was Lorraine Heinisch, of Kenosha WI, who umpired semi-pro games in 1943, including a championship game in Wichita, Kansas. The first woman to umpire a professional game was Bernice Gera. A former Little League coach and a passionate fan of baseball, she entered umpiring school in 1967 (the first woman ever to attend the Fort Lauderdale Baseball School). After a lengthy court battle with major league baseball, she finally won the right to umpire. Her first pro game was in the minor leagues in June 1972--a game between the Auburn Phillies and Geneva Rangers in the New York-Penn League, but after several disputed calls, she decided to resign and never umpired another professional game.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage provides evidence of several women who have umpired or played baseball at various levels, including semi-professional and professional leagues. Therefore, it is likely that at least one woman has played minor league baseball."
201,"Question: is breaking and entering into a car a felony
Passage: Burglary -- In the United States, burglary is prosecuted as a felony or misdemeanor and involves trespassing and theft, entering a building or automobile, or loitering unlawfully with intent to commit any crime, not necessarily a theft--for example, vandalism. Even if nothing is stolen in a burglary, the act is a statutory offense. Buildings can include hangars, sheds, barns, and coops; burglary of boats, aircraft, trucks, and railway cars is possible. Burglary may be an element in crimes involving rape, arson, kidnapping, identity theft, or violation of civil rights; indeed, the ``plumbers'' of the Watergate scandal were technically burglars. As with all legal definitions in the U.S., the foregoing description may not be applicable in every jurisdiction, since there are 50 separate state criminal codes, plus federal and territorial codes in force.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage explains that burglary can involve entering a building or automobile with the intent to commit a crime, which is considered a statutory offense even if nothing is stolen. Since breaking and entering into a car involves entering an automobile with the intent to commit a crime, it falls under the definition of burglary and can be prosecuted as a felony or misdemeanor."

206,"Question: is france the same timezone as the uk
Passage: Time in France -- At the Liberation of France in the summer of 1944, Metropolitan France kept GMT+2 as it was the time then used by the Allies (British Double Summer Time). In the winter of 1944--1945, Metropolitan France switched to GMT+1, same as in the United Kingdom, and switched again to GMT+2 in April 1945 like its British ally. In September 1945, Metropolitan France returned to GMT+1 (pre-war summer time), which the British had already done in July 1945. Metropolitan France was officially scheduled to return to GMT+0 on November 18, 1945 (the British returned to GMT+0 in on October 7, 1945), but the French government canceled the decision on November 5, 1945, and GMT+1 has since then remained the official time of Metropolitan France.

Passage: The Three Little Pigs -- The Three Little Pigs is a fable about three pigs who build three houses of different materials. A big bad wolf blows down the first two pigs' houses, made of straw and sticks respectively, but is unable to destroy the third pig's house, made of bricks. Printed versions date back to the 1840s, but the story itself is thought to be much older. The phrases used in the story, and the various morals drawn from it, have become embedded in Western culture. Many versions of The Three Little Pigs have been recreated or have been modified over the years, sometimes making the wolf a kind character. It is a type 124 folktale in the Aarne--Thompson classification system.

211,"Question: does maple syrup come straight from the tree
Passage: Maple syrup -- Maple syrup is a syrup usually made from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, although it can also be made from other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage explains that maple syrup is made from the sap of maple trees, which is collected by drilling holes into their trunks. The sap is then processed to create the syrup. Therefore, maple syrup does not come straight from the tree."

213,"Question: does the animal cell have a cell membrane
Passage: Cell membrane -- While Robert Hooke's discovery of cells in 1665 led to the proposal of the Cell Theory, Hooke misled the cell membrane theory that all cells contained a hard cell wall since only plant cells could be observed at the time. Microscopists focused on the cell wall for well over 150 years until advances in microscopy were made. In the early 19th century, cells were recognized as being separate entities, unconnected, and bound by individual cell walls after it was found that plant cells could be separated. This theory extended to include animal cells to suggest a universal mechanism for cell protection and development. By the second half of the 19th century, microscopy was still not advanced enough to make a distinction between cell membranes and cell walls. However, some microscopists correctly identified at this time that while invisible, it could be inferred that cell membranes existed in animal cells due to intracellular movement of components internally but not externally and that membranes weren't the equivalent of a cell wall to plant cell. It was also inferred that cell membranes weren't vital components to all cells. Many refuted the existence of a cell membrane still towards the end of the 19th century. In 1890, an update to the Cell Theory stated that cell membranes existed, but were merely secondary structures. It wasn't until later studies with osmosis and permeability that cell membranes gained more recognition. In 1895, Ernest Overton proposed that cell membranes were made of lipids.
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage discusses the history of understanding the cell membrane and how it was initially believed that only plant cells had a cell wall, but eventually it was recognized that all cells have a protective mechanism. The passage also mentions that some microscopists correctly identified the existence of cell membranes in animal cells, but it wasn't until later studies that the importance of cell membranes was recognized. Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, it can be inferred that animal cells do have a cell membrane."

218,"Question: can ingrown toenails come back after being removed
Passage: Surgical treatment of ingrown toenails -- Surgical treatments of ingrown toenails include a number of different options. If conservative treatment of a minor ingrown toenail does not succeed or if the ingrown toenail is severe, surgical management is recommended by a podiatrist. The initial surgical approach is typically a partial avulsion of the nail plate known as a wedge resection or a complete removal of the toenail. If the ingrown toenail reoccurs despite this treatment, destruction of the germinal matrix with phenol is recommended. Antibiotics are not needed if surgery is performed.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage states that if conservative treatment does not work or if the ingrown toenail is severe, surgical management is recommended. The initial surgical approach is either a partial avulsion of the nail plate or a complete removal of the toenail.

220,"Question: is a markup language designed to describe data
Passage: Markup language -- In computer text processing, a markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. The idea and terminology evolved from the ``marking up'' of paper manuscripts, i.e., the revision instructions by editors, traditionally written with a blue pencil on authors' manuscripts. In digital media, this ``blue pencil instruction text'' was replaced by tags, that is, instructions are expressed directly by tags or ``instruction text encapsulated by tags.'' However the whole idea of a mark up language is to avoid the formatting work for the text, as the tags in the mark up language serve the purpose to format the appropriate text (like a header or beginning of a next para...etc.). Every tag used in a Markup language has a property to format the text we write.
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage explains what a markup language is and how it works, but it does not explicitly state that it is designed to describe data. While markup languages can be used to format text, they can also be used for other purposes such as creating structured documents or defining data formats. Therefore, the statement in the question cannot be confirmed as true based on the information provided in the passage."

Passage: Basketball (ball) -- A basketball (basketball ball) is a spherical ball used in basketball games. Basketballs typically range in size from very small promotional items only a few inches in diameter to extra large balls nearly a foot in diameter used in training exercises. For example, a youth basketball could be 27 inches (69 cm) in circumference, while an National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) men's ball would be a maximum of 30 inches (76 cm) and an NCAA women's ball would be a maximum of 29 inches (74 cm). The standard for a basketball in the National Basketball Association (NBA) is 29.5 inches (75 cm) in circumference and for the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), a maximum circumference of 29 inches (74 cm). High school and junior leagues normally use NCAA, NBA or WNBA sized balls.
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage states that the maximum size for an NCAA men's ball is 30 inches, while the standard size for an NBA ball is 29.5 inches. Therefore, the sizes of the balls are not the same."
222,"Question: is it illegal to make covers of songs
Passage: Cover version -- Since the Copyright Act of 1909, United States musicians have had the right to record a version of someone else's previously recorded and released tune, whether it is music alone or music with lyrics. A license can be negotiated between representatives of the interpreting artist and the copyright holder, or recording published tunes can fall under a mechanical license whereby the recording artist pays a standard royalty to the original author/copyright holder through an organization such as the Harry Fox Agency, and is safe under copyright law even if they do not have any permission from the original author. A similar service was provided by Limelight by RightsFlow, until January 2015, when they announced they will be closing their service. The U.S. Congress introduced the mechanical license to head off an attempt by the Aeolian Company to monopolize the piano roll market.

225,"Question: is the liver a part of the gi tract
Passage: Gastrointestinal tract -- All bilaterians have a gastrointestinal tract, also called a gut or an alimentary canal. This is a tube that transfers food to the organs of digestion. In large bilaterians, the gastrointestinal tract generally also has an exit, the anus, by which the animal disposes of feces (solid wastes). Some small bilaterians have no anus and dispose of solid wastes by other means (for example, through the mouth). The human gastrointestinal tract consists of the esophagus, stomach, and intestines, and is divided into the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts. The GI tract includes all structures between the mouth and the anus, forming a continuous passageway that includes the main organs of digestion, namely, the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. However, the complete human digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal tract plus the accessory organs of digestion (the tongue, salivary glands, pancreas, liver and gallbladder). The tract may also be divided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut, reflecting the embryological origin of each segment. The whole human GI tract is about nine metres (30 feet) long at autopsy. It is considerably shorter in the living body because the intestines, which are tubes of smooth muscle tissue, maintain constant muscle tone in a halfway-tense state but can relax in spots to allow for local distention and peristalsis.

Under high rules, an ace can rank either high (e.g. A K♣ Q♣ J 10♠ is an ace-high straight) or low (e.g. 5♣ 4 3♥ 2♥ A♠ is a five-high straight), but the ace cannot rank both high and low in the same hand (e.g. Q♠ K♠ A♣ 2♥ 3 is an ace-high high-card hand, not a straight). Under deuce-to-seven low rules, aces can only rank high, so a hand such as 5♥ 4♠ 3♥ 2♣ A is actually an ace-high high-card hand. Under ace-to-six low rules, aces can only rank low, so a hand such as A♣ K♠ Q♠ J 10♠ is actually a king-high high-card hand.

259,"Question: did they use a real gorilla in mighty joe young
Passage: Mighty Joe Young (1998 film) -- In most of the film, Joe was portrayed by creature-suit performer John Alexander, who wore a radio-controlled animatronic gorilla mask and full body suit created by special makeup effects artist Rick Baker and his crew at Cinovation Studios. To achieve those scenes, Alexander often acted on miniature sets surrounded by blue screen; visual-effects house DreamQuest Images then composited him into footage shot earlier. Joe as an infant was performed by Verne Troyer. For certain scenes, the filmmakers used three full-sized animatronics (one in quadruped, one sitting down, and one in a dead position) also created by Baker's crew. For the digital Joe, visual-effects houses DreamQuest Images and Industrial Light & Magic worked on different scenes, using the same model provided by Baker. Many of these performances were achieved by key-frame animation, but to portray the digital Joe running and jumping, motion-capture data from an infant chimpanzee were used.

269,"Question: is there a state where the drinking age is 18
Passage: U.S. history of alcohol minimum purchase age by state -- From 1976 to 1983, several states voluntarily raised their purchase ages to 19 (or, less commonly, 20 or 21), in part to combat drunk driving fatalities. In 1984, Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which required states to raise their ages for purchase and public possession to 21 by October 1986 or lose 10% of their federal highway funds. By mid-1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had raised their purchase ages to 21 (but not Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, see Additional Notes below). South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate. The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans, because of it being higher than the age of majority (18 in most states) and higher than the drinking ages of most other countries. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act is also seen as a congressional sidestep of the tenth amendment. Although debates have not been highly publicized, a few states have proposed legislation to lower their drinking age, while Guam has raised its drinking age to 21 in July 2010.
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage clearly states that in 1984, Congress passed a law requiring all states to raise their drinking age to 21 by October 1986 or risk losing federal highway funds. By 1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had complied with this law. While some states have proposed lowering the drinking age, the current legal age in all 50 states is 21. Therefore, the answer to the question is false."

Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage explains that a dependent variable can have multiple names depending on the context.

276,"Question: did michael and pam date on the office
Passage: Pam Beesly -- In the series pilot, Michael is overtly rude to Pam and at one point fakes her firing, leaving her in tears. He often makes suggestive if harmless remarks about her beauty and general appearance, and at one point lies to the camera that they used to date (inspiring a horrified ``WHAT???'' from Pam when an interviewer relays the message to her). However, his impulsive attempt to kiss her during Diwali is shot down and marked the end of any romantic dreams for Michael with Pam. Over time, the combination of Michael being supportive of her goals, her transition from a bad relationship with Roy to a great one with Jim as well as her finding a job she not only enjoys but is effective at in the office administrator position and Michael finding his own soulmate in Holly Flax made Pam soften her stance towards Michael, and the experience at the Michael Scott Paper Company further bonded them (as did Michael's decision to choose Pam instead of Ryan Howard as the only MSPC salesman to keep that job when Michael returned as Branch Manager). Pam was furious at Michael for dating her mom Helene, and excoriated him at length during ``The Lover'' before eventually slapping him in ``Double Date'', but they once again were able to be civil to each other afterward. Pam does set up boundaries around her personal life that Michael can't cross, like telling him that he wasn't Cece's godfather. By Season 7, Pam acts as something of a guardian angel for Michael, steering him away from (numerous) bad ideas and towards his (fewer but real) good ones, such as his successful efforts to propose to Holly. In Michael's finale ``Goodbye, Michael'', Pam spends the whole day looking for a shredder, believing that the next day Michael was leaving. As Michael takes off his microphone and heads down the airport concourse, Pam runs to him with no shoes and hugs him as he kisses her cheek. The two have a nice moment and he walks off, leaving her holding her shoes. She then tells the camera that he was happy, wanting to be an advanced rewards member, and was glad to be going home to see Holly. She then is there to watch Michael's plane take off. In a deleted scene from ``The Inner Circle'', we learn Pam is flattered that Michael named his new puppy ``Pamela Beagsley'', and in ``The List'' she playfully teases Jim by calling their second child ``Little Michael Scott'', further proving that the two have developed a genuine friendship.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage describes the evolving relationship between Michael and Pam on The Office, including Michael's initial attraction to Pam, his failed attempts at pursuing her romantically, and their eventual friendship. While there are no clear-cut answers in the passage, it implies that Michael and Pam did not date but instead developed a close bond over time."

281,"Question: can an act be a tort and a crime
Passage: Tort -- The person who commits the act is called a tortfeasor. Although crimes may be torts, the cause of legal action in civil torts is not necessarily the result of criminal action; the harm in civil torts may be due to negligence, which does not amount to criminal negligence. The victim of the harm can recover their loss as damages in a lawsuit. In order to prevail, the plaintiff in the lawsuit, commonly referred to as the injured party, must show that the actions or lack of action was the legally recognizable cause of the harm. The equivalent of tort in civil law jurisdictions is ``delict''.

283,"Question: does enameled cast iron leach iron into food
Passage: Cast-iron cookware -- An American Dietetic Association study found that cast-iron cookware can leach significant amounts of dietary iron into food. The amounts of iron absorbed varied greatly depending on the food, its acidity, its water content, how long it was cooked, and how old the cookware is. The iron in spaghetti sauce increased 945 percent (from 0.61 mg/100g to 5.77 mg/100g), while other foods increased less dramatically; for example, the iron in cornbread increased 28 percent, from 0.67 to 0.86 mg/100g. Anemics, and those with iron deficiencies, may benefit from this effect, which was the basis for the development of the lucky iron fish, an iron ingot used during cooking to provide dietary iron to those with iron deficiency. People with hemochromatosis (iron overload, bronze disease) should avoid using cast-iron cookware because of the iron leaching effect into the food.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage states that a study found that cast-iron cookware can leach significant amounts of dietary iron into food.

Therefore, it implies that Supreme Court justices do need to be confirmed."

294,"Question: is there a difference between doves and pigeons
Passage: Columbidae -- The distinction between ``doves'' and ``pigeons'' is not consistent. In modern everyday speech, as opposed to scientific usage or formal usage, ``dove'' frequently indicates a pigeon that is white or nearly white. However, some people use the terms ``dove'' and ``pigeon'' interchangeably. In contrast, in scientific and ornithological practice, ``dove'' tends to be used for smaller species and ``pigeon'' for larger ones, but this is in no way consistently applied. Historically, the common names for these birds involve a great deal of variation between the terms. The species most commonly referred to as ``pigeon'' is the species known by scientists as the rock dove, one subspecies of which, the domestic pigeon, is common in many cities as the feral pigeon.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage explains that there is no consistent distinction between doves and pigeons, and that the terms are often used interchangeably.

Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage defines a football pitch as the playing surface for the game of association football, which is also known as soccer. Therefore, it can be inferred that soccer can be played on a football field."

316,"Question: do you have to be born with perfect pitch
Passage: Absolute pitch -- Physically and functionally, the auditory system of an absolute listener does not appear to be different from that of a non-absolute listener. Rather, ``it reflects a particular ability to analyze frequency information, presumably involving high-level cortical processing.'' Absolute pitch is an act of cognition, needing memory of the frequency, a label for the frequency (such as ``B-flat''), and exposure to the range of sound encompassed by that categorical label. Absolute pitch may be directly analogous to recognizing colors, phonemes (speech sounds), or other categorical perception of sensory stimuli. Just as most people have learned to recognize and name the color blue by the range of frequencies of the electromagnetic radiation that are perceived as light, it is possible that those who have been exposed to musical notes together with their names early in life will be more likely to identify, for example, the note C. Absolute pitch may also be related to certain genes, possibly an autosomal dominant genetic trait, though it ``might be nothing more than a general human capacity whose expression is strongly biased by the level and type of exposure to music that people experience in a given culture.''
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage explains that absolute pitch is not something that a person is born with, but rather a cognitive ability that can be developed through exposure to music and the memorization of frequency and label information. Therefore, the answer to the question is false."
317,"Question: is an ace 2 3 4 5 a straight
Passage: List of poker hands -- A straight flush is a poker hand containing five cards of sequential rank, all of the same suit, such as Q♥ J♥ 10♥ 9♥ 8♥ (a ``queen-high straight flush''). It ranks below five of a kind and above four of a kind. As part of a straight flush, an ace can rank either above a king or below a two, depending on the rules of the game. Under high rules, an ace can rank either high (e.g. A♥ K♥ Q♥ J♥ 10♥ is an ace-high straight flush) or low (e.g. 5 4 3 2 A is a five-high straight flush), but cannot rank both high and low in the same hand (e.g. Q♣ K♣ A♣ 2♣ 3♣ is an ace-high flush, not a straight flush). Under deuce-to-seven low rules, aces can only rank high, so a hand such as 5♠ 4♠ 3♠ 2♠ A♠ is actually an ace-high flush. Under ace-to-six low rules, aces can only rank low, so a hand such as A♥ K♥ Q♥ J♥ 10♥ is actually a king-high flush. Under ace-to-five low rules, straight flushes are not recognized, and a hand that would be categorized as a straight flush is instead a high card hand.
Based on question and passage, the answer is true. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage explains that a straight flush is a hand containing five cards of sequential rank, all of the same suit. It also mentions that under certain rules, such as high rules, an ace can be used as both a high card and a low card. However, under other rules, such as deuce-to-seven low rules, aces can only rank high. The passage does not explicitly state whether an ace 2 3 4 5 is a straight, but based on the definition of a straight flush and the information provided about aces, it can be inferred that an ace 2 3 4 5 is a straight under certain rules."

Passage: Appointment and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States -- Senate cloture rules historically required a two-thirds affirmative vote to advance nominations to a vote; this was changed to a three-fifths supermajority in 1975. In November 2013, the then-Democratic Senate majority eliminated the filibuster for executive branch nominees and judicial nominees except for Supreme Court nominees by invoking the so called nuclear option.

A 6th epagomenal day is added every 4 years, without exception, on August 29 of the Julian calendar, 6 months before the corresponding Julian leap day. Thus the first day of the Ethiopian year, 1 Mäskäräm, for years between 1900 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually September 11 (Gregorian). However, it falls on September 12 in years before the Gregorian leap year.
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage clearly states that the Ethiopian calendar has 12 months of 30 days each, with an additional 5 or 6 epagomenal days that make up a thirteenth month.

341,"Question: is the speed of sound constant for all materials
Passage: Speed of sound -- In common everyday speech, speed of sound refers to the speed of sound waves in air. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: sound travels most slowly in gases; it travels faster in liquids; and faster still in solids. For example, (as noted above), sound travels at 343 m/s in air; it travels at 1,484 m/s in water (4.3 times as fast as in air); and at 5,120 m/s in iron (about 15 times as fast as in air).

The president is further empowered to grant federal pardons and reprieves, and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of Congress under extraordinary circumstances. The president directs the foreign and domestic policies of the United States, and takes an active role in promoting his policy priorities to members of Congress. In addition, as part of the system of checks and balances, Article One of the United States Constitution gives the president the power to sign or veto federal legislation. Since the office of president was established in 1789, its power has grown substantially, as has the power of the federal government as a whole.
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage clearly states that the president is a member of the executive branch and holds significant powers within it.

343,"Question: can you build up an immunity to arsenic
Passage: Mithridatism -- It is important to note that mithridatism is not effective against all types of poison (immunity generally is only possible with biologically complex types which the immune system can respond to) and, depending on the toxin, the practice can lead to the lethal accumulation of a poison in the body. Results depend on how each poison is processed by the body, ie, on how the toxic compound is metabolized or passed out of the body. In some cases, it is possible to build up tolerance against specific non-biological poisons. For some poisons, this involves conditioning the liver to produce more of the particular enzymes that deal with these poisons (for example alcohol). Another mechanism involves conditioning the target tissues of the poisons. These methods do not work for all non-biological poisons. Exposure to certain toxic substances, such as hydrofluoric acid and heavy metals, is either lethal or has little to no effect, and thus cannot be used in this way at all. Arsenic is a notable exception with some people actually having a genetic adaptation granting them higher resistance which can be replicated with mithridatism. In addition, simple toxins that work through chemical processes that bypass the immune system cannot be dealt with (good example would be the variants of cyanide).
Based on question and passage, the answer is false. Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage explains that building up immunity through mithridatism is not effective for all types of poison and depends on how the poison is processed by the body. While some people may have a genetic adaptation that grants them higher resistance to arsenic, it cannot be generalized that one can build up immunity to arsenic through mithridatism. Therefore, the answer is false."

360,"Question: is chewing tobacco banned in major league baseball
Passage: Tobacco usage in sport -- Between 1920 until 1940, when baseball was Americas most popular sport, every team had a tobacco sponsor. It is common perception that many baseball players use tobacco. According to the MLB however this practice is changing and declining. One source states that a reason chewing tobacco usage increased among baseball players was the misconception that it improved concentration, overall performance and was less harmful than smoking a cigarette. Contrary to this, chewing tobacco does not have an established connection to the performance of baseball players. As more information about the dangers of chewing tobacco has come to light it has become stigmatized within baseball itself with players, staff and managers often having to ``sneak'' off to partake. These individuals understand that children will easily copy their actions and try to hide them now, as they are negative role models for youth. Most players have made attempts to quit, but the majority struggle in breaking their addiction. Lenny Dykstra, the former Philadelphia Phillies center-fielder, started dipping at a young age, unaware of how difficult quitting would be. He tells young children, ``They call me ``Nails'' because they say I'm as tough as nails. But I'm not tough enough to beat the spit-tobacco habit. Copy my hustle, copy my determination. But don't copy my spit-tobacco habit.'' In addition Major League Baseball has taken actions to lower tobacco usage amongst its players. This includes a complete ban on tobacco with fines for players and their managers if it is discovered. In the major leagues tobacco companies are no longer allowed to leave free products in stadium clubhouses for the players, with a ban effective December 5, 2016, in the new Collective Bargaining Agreement that prohibits players entering MLB for the first time from using tobacco. (Players who had experience in MLB prior to the day are grandfathered.) Baseball stadiums have stricter tobacco policies for patrons as well though the level of strictness varies per stadium.

Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage states that Major League Baseball has taken actions to lower tobacco usage amongst its players, including a complete ban on tobacco with fines for players and their managers if it is discovered.

After Eisenhower died that March, there were a number of proposals to honor him with the new coin. While these bills generally commanded wide support, enactment was delayed by a dispute over whether the new coin should be in base metal or 40% silver. In 1970, a compromise was reached to strike the Eisenhower dollar in base metal for circulation, and in 40% silver as a collectible.

In the town of Chapel Hill, open carry is restricted to guns of a certain minimum size, under the theory that small, concealable handguns are more often associated with criminal activity. No permit is required to carry a handgun openly in North Carolina. In the court case of State v. Kerner(1921) the defendant ended up getting into some type of confrontation with another man. The defendant proceeded to walk back to his place of work, get his gun, and then return to the scene to fight. The defendant ended up being charged with ``carrying a concealed weapon'' and ``carrying his pistol off his premises unconcealed,'' which violated a local act applicable to Forsyth County and ended up being a misdemeanor. The defendant was taken to trial and the trial judge then dismissed the charge as unconstitutional. The state then appealed, and the supreme court affirmed. During court, the court stated at the beginning that the Second Amendment did not apply, because ``the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution are restrictions on the federal authority and not the states.'' Therefore, with that being said, it focused more on the state constitution. The state constitution states that: ``A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'' The court viewed the provision as protecting the right to carry arms in public. Forsyth County's local act was condemned and seen as distasteful, because it ended up putting a restriction on a persons right to carry a pistol, more so an unconcealed pistol. Although, the case of State v. Kerner helped/made more clear the allowance of openly carrying a pistol, it does not preclude all regulations regarding the carrying of firearms.

Without using 'question', 'passage', or revealing the answer or outcome in your response, explain why: ","The passage states that open carry is legal in North Carolina and no permit is required to carry a handgun openly. It does not mention any restrictions on carrying a firearm openly while possessing a concealed carry permit.

392,"Question: does the size of a rain gauge matter
Passage: Rain gauge -- Due to the ever-increasing numbers of observers, standardisation of the gauges became necessary. Symons began experimenting on new gauges in his own garden.
