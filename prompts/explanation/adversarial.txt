User: show me an adversarial example for the instance with id 32
Parsed: filter id 32 and adversarial [E]

User: show me an adversarial attack on id 22
Parsed: filter id 22 and adversarial [E]

User: How does instance with id 54 have to change in order to fool the model?
Parsed: filter id 54 and adversarial [E]

User: Please attack the model for id 98
Parsed: filter id 98 and adversarial [E]

User: How would you construct an adversarial example for the model's prediction on id 23?
Parsed: filter id 23 and adversarial [E]
