User: Including {num_features} less than {num_values} into the prior data, what are the model's predictions?
Parsed: previousfilter or filter {num_features} less than {num_values} and predict [E]

User: With the addition of {num_features} equal to {num_values}, why does the model do these predictions?
Parsed: previousfilter or filter {num_features} equal to {num_values} and explain features [E]

User: Adding in {num_features} not equal to {num_values}, what are the model's predictions?
Parsed: previousfilter or filter {num_features} not equal to {num_values} and predict [E]

User: Excluding {num_features} greater than or equal to {num_values}, what are the model's predictions?
Parsed: previousfilter and filter {num_features} greater equal than {num_values} and predict [E]
