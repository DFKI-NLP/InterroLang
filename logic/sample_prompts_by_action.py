    """Attempts to replace ids that don't exist in the data with ones that do.

    The problem is that prompt generation may create prompts with ids that don't occur
    in the data. This is fine for the purposes of generating training data. However,
    when the user clicks "generate an example question" we should try and make sure
    that the example question uses ids that actually occur in the data, so they
    don't get errors if they try and run the prompt (this seems a bit unsatisfying).
    This function resolves this issues by trying to find occurrences of ids in the prompts
    and replaces them with ids that are known to occur in the data.

    Arguments:
        prompt: The prompt to try and replace with an actual id in the data.
        real_ids: A list of ids that occur in the data **in actuality**
